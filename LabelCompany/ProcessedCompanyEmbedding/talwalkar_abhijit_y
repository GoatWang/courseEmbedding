delivered solid results for the first quarter with revenue towards the high end of guidance and with nongaap eps exceeding the high end of our guidance range we delivered strong nongaap gross margin performance of  and we maintained good expense control during the quarter we saw higherthanexpected revenues in ip licensing and revenues in our hdd business also were higher than expected as customers increased orders for both socs and preamps looking into q our guidance reflects a cautious environment and roughly  sequential revenue growth at midpoint we anticipate mid singledigit percentage growth in product revenues including growth in flash networking and server products offset by declines in ip licensing as that business returns to a more typical level of quarterly revenue as we look forward into the second half and beyond we remain very excited about our new product cycles across all our businesses we have been successful at expanding our customer base in pcie flash adapter solutions and expect new ramps with leading server oems and a broad base of end customers including those from hyperscale web cloud financial services and many emerging web companies around the world in mobile and enterprise networking the combination of new axxia programs and numerous custom silicon products is expected to drive healthy growth in hdd we have won  of the hybrid drive platforms at seagate including gig drives and can benefit as hybrids gain traction in the second half of this year and into  in servers were in a leadership position in sas for the expected second half transition from gig to gig and well have multiple oems launch shared storage solutions based on our syncro technology now id like to briefly review additional product highlights and growth drivers for our businesses in flash were the only company offering standard product flash storage processors or fsps custom fsps and pcie flash adapters and related caching software positioning lsi to benefit from a multiyear growth cycle in flashbased storage solutions with our existing fsps lsi has established a leadership position in satabased ssds which represent the highest volume of ssds shipping this year across client and enterprise applications i am pleased to announce that through our customers lsibased ssds are now shipping or will soon ship into  of the top  mega data centers companies worldwide this quarter we expect to tape out our thirdgeneration flash storage processor and are excited about the differentiated features incorporated into this new architecture in addition to gig sata the  series will support native pcie with ahci and mvme interfaces we expect to sample the product to our customers next quarter and a number of major ssd companies have already committed to this nextgeneration product furthermore we have added significant resources to accelerate the proliferation of this nextgeneration architecture across all ssd segments to ensure our leadership position into the future in addition to standard product fsps we continue to gain traction with custom fsps securing wins with  of the top  flash oems by combining the customers controller technology with lsi building blocks to provide a complete solution overall lsi now has  different custom fsp products that are either in production or in development across  different ssd providers these custom products are a combination of client and enterprise fsps supporting either sata sas or pcie interfaces the unique combination of both standard and custom fsps enables lsi to service all segments and flash controller implementation models for fsps ill now move to pciebased flash solutions where i want to spend some extra time given the exciting growth potential this technology has tremendous promise given its ability to drastically improve application performance and deliver significant total cost of ownership benefits to it organizations of all sizes at the same time this market is in the category creation phase and is far from reaching broad adoption based on inputs we have received from customers we believe broad adoption will occur through a variety of solutions and business models including those that are disaggregated for some hyperscale environments because we offer a portfolio of pcie flash adapters flash controller silicons sas raidonchip devices and raid software and adapters we are uniquely positioned to provide a broad range of solutions lsis gotomarket strategy is multidimensional reaching into hyperscale web cloud and financial services accounts directly cultivating a broad base of longstanding oem customers and leveraging lsis existing indirect channel that reaches solution bars that sell into a broad base of web to traditional enterprise customers from a product offering standpoint we believe lsi has now established itself as the supplier offering the broadest portfolio of products and this is a key point of differentiation versus all competition leveraging our silicon software and systems expertise we have been successful in creating a whole new category of products in the pcie flash adapter space with our nytro megaraid offering nytro megaraid products combine lowcapacity flash with industryproven megaraid technology to offer seamless caching acceleration and data protection in servers were experiencing strong interest in this products unique capability for example through a very close collaboration jpmorgan chase is deploying a server hadoop cluster with a nytro megaraid adapter in each server this enables a  overall reduction in acquisition cost and total cost of ownership while meeting strenuous performance and reliability requirements this is a very strong endorsement of lsis nytro technology adding to this momentum intel recently announced solutions leveraging lsi nytro megaraid technology and ibm is now offering lsi nytro warpdrive technology with their system x servers to help clients speed big data analytics in total we now have ibm intel oracle cisco netapp supermicro emc and dell offering our nytro flash solutions to their customers and our direct end customer pipeline continues to grow rapidly we expect the list of oems offering lsi nytro solutions to continue to grow through the year reinforcing lsi as the  provider of merchant pcie flash solutions in our sas and raid business last month we announced that we are the first company to ship productionlevel gig sas raidonchip and io controller solutions to oem customers we expect customers to begin migrating servers from gig sas to gig sas in the second half of this year at launch lsi can offer a  throughput performance increase using current generation gig drives with lsis gig sas solutions so big data environments such as hadoop clusters can benefit today from  even before gig hard drives and ssds become broadly available beyond our traditional sas business this quarter we expect to release our syncro product family which provides a new storage architecture that enables sharing and scaling of storage across multiple servers we expect numerous oems to launch systemlevel solutions to the marketplace at midyear in hard disk drives lsi is well positioned in the most resilient segments of the storage market in q we expect over  of our soc revenue to be driven by shipments in the desktop enterprise and nearline drives which are collectively expected to be a driver of storage capacity for cloud and mega data center buildouts in the enterprise space lsi has reinforced its leadership by securing design awards at all enterprise hdd oems in nanometer technology with the first platforms launching in early  this will enable future share growth for lsi in enterprise socs in the notebook space while we have very little exposure today to the traditional inch acdbased notebook pc market we do have wins that can lead to future share gains moving forward pc makers and hard disk drive suppliers have a challenge to improve the performance of notebooks seagate recently announced a family of solid state hybrid drives or sshds that are up to x faster than todays traditional notebook hard drives featuring significantly faster boot and resume times we are pleased to announce that lsi has won  of seagates thirdgeneration solid state hybrid drive platforms which include both gig and terabyte capacities as we look to the second half of this year we are well positioned to benefit as these drives have the potential to replace gig per platter drives which have far lower performance than new hybrids the story in hdd continues to be around  strong suppliers in a consolidated marketplace we feel good about our position to grow share over the long term given our product portfolio and design wins i would now like to discuss our networking business where our products address the wireless mobile network data center and enterprise market segments in addition to seeking leading technology these system oems have been increasingly working with fewer and fewer semiconductor suppliers to help them consolidate more indiscernible integration to reduce costs and power consumption while also maintaining an ability to differentiate with their own unique ip we have been successful in serving these segments with a combination of custom silicon and our growing family of axxia multicorestandard products we continue to expand our footprint in wireless mobile network applications per our announcement at mobile world congress we were awarded multigeneration wins with nokia siemens networks lsi was selected to provide both standard product axxia multicore communication processors and custom baseband silicon for future generations of base stations as our designs ramp at  of the top  market leaders it will enable lsi to grow from less than  share today to  share in data and control plane processing and  share in baseband silicon in the coming years expanding from our beachhead in wireless base stations we have been driving a similar strategy for  months across enterprise and data center ethernet switching as a result we have won  strategic sockets in the data center and enterprise market segments with several designs already in production and the rest in various stages of development first in custom products we have begun shipments of a custom switch chip for a highend campus core modular switch as well as several data center switches we have also won a number of custom switch and octofi ph solutions in very highvolume systems with production beginning in the second half of  finally axxia products are being used as the line card cpu in nextgeneration data center switches while in parallel were aiming to take axxia products into highervolume ethernet switches in fact we recently announced the axxia  which is well suited for nextgeneration switches and routers as well as the challenges faced by nextgeneration networks including software defined networks there are dozens of other opportunities we are pursuing across this application space and expect our success to continue continuing our close collaboration with arm last quarter we announced the axxia  product family which combines  arm cores with our specialized networking accelerators to optimize performance and power efficiency mobile broadband is outpacing infrastructure capability and service providers need solutions that will meet traffic performance requirements while also minimizing cost and power consumption the axxia  product family addresses these needs with an exciting and very flexible architecture that delivers exceptionally high performance without sacrificing power efficiency to wrap up we continue to demonstrate solid performance in an uncertain environment and have established product cycles to drive growth going forward the midpoint of q revenue guidance reaffirms our expectation that q was a trough for our business as we expect to drive growth going forward as long as the economic environment remains stable lsi is well positioned with share gain opportunities and new product cycles in growing markets we also have a large share buyback authorization and are well positioned to return capital to shareholders now ill turn the call over to bryon who will take you through our results and provide guidance bryon look thanks abhi and good afternoon everyone ill start with a few highlights for the quarter revenue at  million came in towards the high end of guidance nongaap gross margins were  near the high end of guidance nongaap operating expenses were  million just below the midpoint of guidance nongaap operating margin was  and nongaap diluted earnings per share were  above the high end of guidance now turning to a more detailed discussion of our financial results for the quarter beginning with revenues q revenues were  million down  sequentially and down  on a yearoveryear basis our server and storage semiconductor revenues which include products from our serveraid adapter and software flash sas san and hdd businesses were  million down  sequentially and down  on a yearoveryear basis sequential reductions were primarily due to seasonal declines in key end markets such as servers and pcs server and storage semiconductors represented  of total revenues in the first quarter q revenues in our networking business were  million down  sequentially and down  on a yearoveryear basis sequential reductions were primarily due to seasonal declines in our networking end markets networking represented  of total revenues for the first quarter revenues for the ip business were  million up sequentially by  million this revenue is higher than our typical quarterly results driven by specific contracts in the quarter we expect ip licensing to return to its normalized run rate going forward moving next to gross margins lsis q gross margin excluding special items was  near the high end of guidance we provided in january benefiting from higherthanusual ip revenue as well as improvements in manufacturing costs in terms of operating expenses rd together with sga expenses excluding special items totaled  million in q just below the midpoint of our guidance nongaap operating income for the quarter was  million or  of revenue interest income and other net of interest expense excluding special items was  million for q this includes approximately  million of final payments received for insurance claims covering our losses that resulted from the thailand flooding in  now let me turn to the special items we recorded in the first quarter which netted to  million special items primarily noncash included  million in amortization of acquisitionrelated items  million of stockbased compensation expense and  million of restructuring costs and other items moving next to tax our tax provision on both a gaap and nongaap basis can vary significantly quartertoquarter based on our profitability in different geographic tax jurisdictions and discrete items we experienced such events in q where the expiration of certain statutes of limitation contributed to a net noncash tax benefit of approximately  million on a gaap and nongaap basis on a gaap basis first quarter net income was approximately  million or  per share nongaap net income was  million or  per share which is above the high end of our guidance our q results include the favorable impact of the tax benefit i just mentioned as well as payments received for thai flood insurance claims which together contributed approximately  per share to our net income the diluted weighted average share count for the period for both gaap and nongaap purposes was  million shares this includes the weighted average benefit of purchasing approximately  million shares during the period under our stock repurchase program we utilized approximately  million in q from our stock buyback authorization turning now to the balance sheet and cash flows we ended the first quarter with cash and shortterm investments of approximately  million operating cash flows for q were  million and we continue to operate with no debt on our balance sheet finally with respect to q results depreciation and software amortization were  million and capital expenditures were  million next is a discussion of our guidance for q  q revenues in a range of  million to  million or sequentially up approximately  at midpoint compared to a strongerthanexpected q we are expecting mid singledigit percentage growth in product revenues offset by declines in ip licensing as that business returns to its typical quarterly run rate we expect our server and storage semiconductor revenues to be sequentially up in q with growth coming from our flash businesses as well as our server and storage connectivity businesses we expect our hdd business to be roughly flat and we expect our networking semiconductor revenues to be slightly up gross margin excluding special items is expected to be  plus or minus  operating expenses excluding special items are expected to be in the range of  million to  million with the increase primarily driven by annual merit increases interest income and other and interest expense excluding special items is expected to net to income of approximately  million special items are expected to net to approximately  million to  million the gaap and nongaap tax provision is expected to be approximately  million for q we expect our nongaap tax rate to be between  and  for the remaining quarters in  we expect q gaap net income in a range of negative  to positive  per share and nongaap net income in the range of  to  per share the share count is expected to be approximately  million shares for both gaap and nongaap purposes in addition we expect depreciation and software amortization of approximately  million for q and  million for the full year and capital expenditures of approximately  million in q and  million for the full year in closing we delivered strong q results in a seasonally soft quarter we continued with our stock buyback program and ended the first quarter with approximately  million remaining in the authorization while we remain in a challenging environment we are confident in our market positions and growth prospects as we move forward now let me turn the call to sujal sujal shah thank you bryon at this point we will begin the qa portion of the call eliah will you please give the instructions for the qa session questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and you do have a question from the line of blayne curtis christopher hemmelgarn  barclays capital research division this is chris hemmelgarn on for blayne first off could you just talk a little bit to how share is looking particularly in hdd enterprise just what trends are like there and how that went during the quarter abhijit y talwalkar yes i mean i think as certainly has been discussed there are some share shifts that are occurring in the enterprise in the near term but i think its probably more constructive to talk about the overall hdd business in aggregate as we look forward we feel pretty good about the hdd business and expect that q to be the trough and sort of the floor for this business theres lots of different moving parts and i think looking at the business in aggregate is probably the best way to look at it so if we assume a stable tam to modest improvements of tam in the second half as well as no significant share shifts at the customer level not our share but our customers share in terms of the segments they participate in we believe our hdd business is stable and should improve from here if you look a little bit under the covers from an enterprise standpoint whats important to remember is today we ship at seagate we ship at hitachi and those  companies are comparable within a couple of points in terms of overall market share as we look a little bit forward we have won all  hdd oems with our nanometer enterprise soc and expect shipments to begin in the first half of  which will allow us to maintain our high share in enterprise and grow it from there as well in the case of notebooks the vast majority are basically all the share shifts that occurred in the course of last year and into this quarter are largely all behind us and just about  of our business is across desktop and enterprise we are also starting to see favorable impact from toshibas focus on the desktop sort of business that they picked up from hitachi as the industry overall looks for a third player and were seeing favorable benefits there and lastly we also have an soc ramping into wd that we expect to benefit through the course of this year so all in all we feel very good about q being the floor and growing from here and then just lastly long term we continue to be very positive on our prospects in growing share long term where our share is overall somewhere in the s there are  major players in hdd and they look towards balancing the overall supplier base weve won a number of notebook socs middle of last year that we expect to contribute and i articulated earlier our very strong position in enterprise going forward christopher hemmelgarn  barclays capital research division glad to hear that you  so you guys do expect the soc at western digital to ramp sometime this year abhijit y talwalkar we started shipping initial production quantities in q that ramp continues in q and we remain very excited about the prospects there christopher hemmelgarn  barclays capital research division great okay so then my second question is just could you talk a little bit about how ssds were in the quarter and are they still on track to outgrow the market rate i think you guys quoted a  market growth rate there abhijit y talwalkar yes i mean what we quoted and i think what you are referring to is really overall flash business and from an fsp standpoint flash storage processors theyre basically flat coming into the quarter we believe we held share in the quarter based on sort of our data if we step back and look at overall aggregate fsps we feel very good about our position we provided some additional transparency relative to the number of custom projects that we have as well to the tune of  the combination of our custom sort of participation as well as our standard product based on sandforce really gives us a fantastic and a very unique position and allows us to play across a very broad spectrum of ssd players from the nand guys to the channel guys as well and we feel very good about our share and prospects in that overall business and then theres also pcie flash in aggregate we certainly have talked about the aggregate business growing at  this year at least at market level and thats what the analysts still are really projecting in terms of overall potential growth for our aggregate flash sam what we have to watch along the course of this year is nand availability and nand pricing which certainly was elevated in the second half of last year were starting to see that sort of attempt to come back in line availability certainly has been a little bit of a concern in the second half of last year the pcie flashbased sort of accelerator market the adapter market is still very much early in its life so we are going to see sort of lumpiness if you will as that market develops into a larger market but aside from those we feel very good about our ability to grow at the market growth rates operator your next question comes from the line of james schneider gabriela borges  goldman sachs group inc research division this is gabriela borges on behalf of jim i wanted to just follow up on the commentary on the pcie flash business with the description of it being lumpy because its in the early stages of adoption can you share with us any details on what you expect going into the second half of the year and what kind of level of visibility you might have on that business abhijit y talwalkar well we certainly expect the business gabriela to grow nicely in the second half weve been working very aggressively across all our sort of routes to market from directly engaging end customers in the hyperscale environments to financial services as well as growing our list of oems that are offering our product and selling our product as well as leveraging our extensive var channels so were very pleased with the progress that were making in establishing lsi as really the  player with the breadth of products our overall opportunity pipeline is up  from last quarter our overall pocs that we have active pocs with customers looking at how our products enhance their overall usage models and environments and enable them to accelerate applications and improve total cost of ownership the pocs are up nearly  from last quarter so were very very happy with the traction and expect this market to continue to grow but the market does remain in an early phase in its life and theres a lot of trial and discovery but the promise remains significant gabriela borges  goldman sachs group inc research division thats very helpful color and then as a followup if i may i think you mentioned normal seasonality in the server networking markets in q and it certainly seems like data points in carrier and enterprise spending have been relatively muted so far yeartodate can you give us an update on what youre seeing in these  verticals as we go into q abhijit y talwalkar yes i mean i think as you said from a server standpoint server seasonality sort of behaved as expected in q but relative to wireless or service provider spending really that remained soft over the course of q and assumed to be soft incorporated in our guidance into q as to the second half i think were probably like everyone else waiting to see the signals there which arent  have not yet really materialized theres certainly a lot of talk about china potentially spending more in terms of lte deployments and getting those started but at this point in time i would say soft in service provider segments in the first half on the enterprise side i think behave generally seasonally slightly better off obviously than wireless service provider and do expect enterprise networking to be up in the second half operator your next question will come from the line of christian schwab christian d schwab  craighallum capital group llc research division as we look to the disk drive tam next quarter which you  guided your revenues to be flat given weve gone through probably a quarter inventory adjustment by your largest customers as they overbuilt for anticipated demand and that looks to be relatively done could we see revenues up in the june quarter similar to nidacs message earlier today abhijit y talwalkar i have not had time to absorb nidacs message but i think our assumption and whats sort of factored into our guidance is sort of a flattish tam in the quarter for q and some level of modest improvements in the second half operator your next question will come from the line of hans mosesmann hans c mosesmann  raymond james  associates inc research division abhi on  going to hard disk drives again the enterprise  the success that youre getting in  at all  of these oems on the enterprise side whats driving that is that the nanometer is that your performance is  or just the natural kind of indiscernible abhijit y talwalkar yes yes yes and yes hans i mean i think as  if youll recall weve been maniacal about timetomarket execution on critical transitions and thats what has led us to go from the teens in terms of share   plus years ago to in the mid s and we were there first at  first at  with ldpc and so forth and the same thing relative to  we have a we believe a very commanding position in there in terms of technology as well as our rechannel performance and we have been the leader in terms of enterprise socs for quite a long time and its that collection of strengths that has led to and led to over the past our ability to win all  hdd oems in the enterprise space on that nanometer sort of technology platform which we expect to ship  begin shipping in the first half of  hans c mosesmann  raymond james  associates inc research division okay great and abhijit y talwalkar by the way hans while were talking about nanometer its also the nanometer leadership position that has enabled us to win several notebook socs that we also expect to contribute to our longerterm share gains as we try to move up from where we are to lets just say a more balanced supplier base hans c mosesmann  raymond james  associates inc research division and as a followup if i may on axxia and specifically to the arm version of  what are the competitive dynamics there that youre seeing within the arm kind of camp itself and when is the timing of kind of sales for that product abhijit y talwalkar well the arm product the  the axxia  which is a core arm product that also obviously leverages all our unique sort of accelerators targeted towards networking workloads in particular the  is aimed at the wireless infrastructure space where weve had tremendous success with both ericsson and we talked about nokia siemens on the call in the prepared remarks as well we believe we are well ahead of the competition relative to that class of a network processor leveraging arm and before ive commented that were potentially  to  months ahead potentially more in terms of delivering real silicon there and that is what has led to along with all the other attributes of axxia the success that weve had in the mobile network space yes and the same customers we have that are  that we won with axxia on the power base are committed and are in development around the  as well operator your next question comes from the line of novak sic vivek arya unknown analyst this is eschi schraud ph for vivek arya question on the thoughts on how  the customer needs for enterprise pcie flash it seems to have changed over the last couple of years i mean some of the more integrated hardware and software kind of providers approach pursued by some of the early leaders is changing somewhat to a more piecemeal approach to hardware and software so im just wondering how has lsi adapted to some of these changes and also when do you see sales beginning to accelerate in this business is it a  event or more a  event abhijit y talwalkar well the  let me answer the latter part of your question i mean we certainly expect sales to grow and accelerate this year and as weve talked about in the second half this year just based on the momentum that weve established with a broad base of customers and channels relative to your first comment in terms of the evolution of how flash is being deployed i would argue it hasnt really stabilized or established itself because its so early in its life and some of the initial deployment that makes up a large percentage of the marketplace today especially some of the big hyperscale guys they are absolutely thinking about different deployment models and some of those deployment models are disaggregated in nature as you used a different term and its a term sort of im using you used the term piecemeal and thats driven by some for a lot of different reasons whether its tco whether its serviceability and so forth and you asked relative to where lsi is i think were at the forefront of this because we have the ability and have been having discussions with a broad base of customers especially the hyperscale ones to be able to talk at that level and enable them and work with them to implement flash in many different implementation models and the reason is is a were not necessarily stuck to one particular business model but we have all the ingredients we have flash storage processors that are going into a full breadth of ssds we have raid adapters we have raid software we have caching software that sits on top of that so we can play at any level of integration right and we have the broadest nytro product offering we believe of our competitive base so we think were really well positioned here as this market continues to evolve as more and more people deploy flash for the benefits that it provides unknown analyst got it okay thats great second question is on the intels transition to nanometer ivy bridge and avatan ph beyond  later this year i mean are there any technological or feature changes on the platform which could potentially accelerate or hinder lsis server and storage product growth prospects any color on the puts and takes would be helpful abhijit y talwalkar no not at all i think its orthogonal and to the extent that this refresh here in the second half is a healthy strong refresh in terms of roi for end customers that only benefits lsi because lsi has such a strong market share position across the x server base right were shipping to every player in the marketplace and we do have a strong sort of competitive position and lead relative to gig sas which is certainly going to be adopted by i think all the players at some degree as that transition starts in the second half unknown analyst okay so last year you didnt really see the  a big jump from romley but i mean are expectations a bit more positive for this transition you think or abhijit y talwalkar i  we believe so but again a lot of factors there the biggest one being just overall economic environment but we certainly do expect the second half if economic environments remain stable the second half should be stronger than the first half operator your next question comes from the line of chris rolland christopher rolland  fbr capital markets  co research division so i guess some people have been waiting a while for your gen  ssd controllers well im wondering what that ramp might look like in terms of end products is it going to be sort of lumpy sort of a burst at the beginning because there might be some pentup demand there and then also what sort of differentiators might we see this time around besides just faster iops abhijit y talwalkar yes i mean were not going to get into a list of our differentiators certainly dont want to aid our competition any more than we want to but we feel very good about the architecture and all of the features and all the conversations that weve been having with customers especially a lot of our lead customers across the current sandforce product base that its a superior architecture and a superior platform and also we have the ability and are working on proliferating that architecture aggressively across the full spectrum of ssds as the ssd market grows its been segmenting and were going to play across all those segments as to the profile the ramp and so forth again dont want to get into the details here beyond what we said which is we expect to tape out this quarter and sample in the third quarter and we feel very good and i just want to reinforce also the combination of both standard products based on sandforce in this next generation but also our participation in custom which bodes well to a number of the nand companies that want to also do custom and have their differentiation were very unique in this regard right which is going to allow us to maintain leadership share and continue to grow at or better than market growth rates christopher rolland  fbr capital markets  co research division got you also as haswell ramps this year well first of all whats your overview of the pc market more generally in terms of growth rates and also call it pure ssd attach rates there especially as we move into haswell abhijit y talwalkar well i mean i think in terms of our assumptions relative to the commentary we provided whether its q or the highlevel color i provided for the full year were expecting pc units to sort of decline mid single digits for the year kind of consistent with what is out there across a broad spectrum of analysts in terms of attach rates ssd attach rates in general continue to be low i mean theres a high single digits sort of  and growing from there and as i think this generation of haswell products come out and the push for the pc industry to offer more compelling pcs that can compete with tablets or at least fight that share of wallet game more effectively thats going to drive more adoption of ssds more adoption of dualdrive ssds with hard drive and flash as well as hybrids which we feel pretty good about and were very well positioned there as that continues to grow and from our standpoint we have very low to little exposure to the traditional notebook inch hard drives so we think were in the best position from that standpoint operator your next question comes from the line of steven chin steven chin  ubs investment bank research division first question in terms of the hybrid hard drives what do you estimate will be the penetration of these products in the traditional notebook share ultrabook market by the year end and also what do you think your market share could be abhijit y talwalkar well i mean on market share right now all i can tell you is were very well positioned across all of seagates hybrid offerings and seagate has been really the leader in this space although the market has yet to form in sort of any kind of meaningful size we do hear and do see across this next generation base of haswell pcs that come out theres certainly a fairly healthy adoption of hybrids time will tell pricing is going to be a big factor not only pricing by the hard drive vendors but also pricing of the pcs as well as they push to hit   price points to compete against the whole tablet challenge that they face at least one challenge that they face so very difficult to predict based on lab tests and so forth we think hybrids are  have a lot of promise in addressing what hard drives today  traditional hard drives cant which is very rapid boot times but more importantly very rapid resume times steven chin  ubs investment bank research division got it and just one quick followup for your enterprise pcie nand cache products can you please discuss how the demand was in q and what the overall data center cloud customer demand was abhijit y talwalkar yes i mean i think it was down from q slightly but again not indicative at all relative to momentum momentum was just the opposite direction this is just back to my comments that this is a market thats still very early in its phase has not established sort of a run rate level of composition and theres a lot of discovery trial and pocs that are in flight and all of those metrics which is what we watch right now are up and to the right very aggressively operator your next question comes from the line of betsy van hees betsy van hees  wedbush securities inc research division im sorry if i missed this but i was wondering if you could  in your server and storage business if you could help us understand how much of that is your flash business how much is hdd as a percentage range and then the other chips and then my followup is you talked about  briefly about nand pricing and nand i dont know if you mentioned supply constraints but it seems like its been a little bit challenging in q and it looks like supply and demand is going to be fairly tight throughout the balance of the year how do you see that helping or hindering your business particularly in the enterprise space abhijit y talwalkar okay betsy on the first question our server and storage sort of business was roughly  million for q in terms of the overall composition assume that hdds are roughly in the high s in terms of percentage servers in high s and flash sort of in the mid teens roughly okay relative to nand yes i mean nand certainly was elevated in q and q in terms of pricing availability was certainly tight we are starting to see that sort of improve and recede a bit over the course of q and certainly expect that to improve into the second half we dont  were not too concerned relative to that in terms of our business as it pertains to our flash storage processor business as i said earlier our footprint is very very broad with probably  to  different designs either standard or custom across nand companies that certainly have less of an issue in terms of supply but also a broad base of other forms of oem and then relative to our pcie flash adapter business given that market is still smaller and early in its sort of deployment we dont anticipate any concerns there in terms of availability so right now i would say we are not concerned too much relative to nand pricing or availability impacting our business this year its something well have to watch closely sujal shah all right thank you betsy it looks like we have no further questions so id like to thank all of you for joining us this afternoon if you have any additional questions please call investor relations at lsi thank you and have a nice day operator ladies and gentlemen a telephonic replay of the conference call will be available beginning today approximately
