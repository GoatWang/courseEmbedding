come by way of commodityrelated issuer s over this period – which collectively account for a limited corner of the overall market from this respect the majority of the asset class outstanding continued to remain in relatively benign shape fundamentally performance summary  eaton vance floatingrate income plus fund eff outperformed the index at net asset value for the quarter security

about the path of forward default probabilities through december the ratio was  only  traded below  a level considered to be higher in default risk overall we believe defaults are likely to grind modestly higher in the coming year bu t remain low and below average in an historical context this view aligns with the latest splcd quarterly survey of loan managers with the latest poll showing that participants have cut forecasts of nearterm loan defaults though the current credit c ycle may indeed be in its later innings decent economic data now and the potential for supportive trumpera policies ahead should shift default risk from the nearer term to something further out market pricing indicates positivebutnonetheless very limited price appreciation potential from here the average

shaping up to take its place in the coupon component of returns – as the fed projects three quarterpoint rate hikes with month libor at the average floor in the loan market and month libor at  the higher income potential that may follow the next fed rate hike will likely continue to draw investor attention looking ahead we believe the markets technical ba lance remains tipped toward one of
