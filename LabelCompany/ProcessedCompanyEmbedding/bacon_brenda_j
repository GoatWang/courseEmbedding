by brenda j reau michigan state university extension michigan state university product center tweet pin it “everything is better with bacon” is a statement that resonates with pork producers culinary experts and consumers bacon is the term for the cured belly of a hog carcass most bacon sold in the united states is referred to as “streaky” bacon which is long narrow slices cut crosswise from the hog belly that contain veins of meat within the fat several steps are involved in producing bacon each pork belly must be skinned and any ragged edges trimmed the product is then cured which usually involves injection of a brine containing ingredients that make bacon taste like bacon and not just pork the next step is thermal processing and usually includes traditional smoking bacon receives its smoke flavor either from natural smoke obtained by smoldering wood chips or by spraying with a liquid smoke extract  despite consumer trends in healthier eating and more economical food selections bacon is a prevalent meat choice and is also a popular accent to many other foods once primarily a breakfast staple bacon has moved into other eating arenas bacon is frequently found in salads soups sandwiches and as a compliment to burgers and pizza novel use of bacon is also showing up in ice cream cakes cookies and even donuts this trend is seen both in meals eaten at home and in meals eaten away from home bacon has become a popular addition to fastfood menus these incidental sales are referred to as a knockon effect ron plain an agricultural economist at university of missouri said “every time bacon is put on a fastfood sandwich it is incremental growth in sales a knockon effect can follow most people find the taste of bacon on fastfood sandwiches to be appealing and that may influence their purchasing decisions at the grocery stores”  mintel a large consumer market research firm recently conducted surveys on consumer perceptions purchasing practices and consumption of red meat mintel reported bacon has wide consumer acceptance and is the second most commonly purchased red meat with  percent of households reporting in the surveys they purchase bacon thirty eight percent
