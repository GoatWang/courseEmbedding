service roger d kornberg was awarded the  nobel prize in chemistry for his studies of the molecular basis of eukaryotic transcription he determined how dnas genetic blueprint is read and used to direct the process for protein manufacture kornberg carried out a significant part of the research leading to this prize at the stanford synchrotron radiation laboratory ssrl a department of energy doesupported research facility located at the stanford linear accelerator center slac kornberg also carried out research at the advanced light source another doefunded synchrotron light source located at the lawrence berkeley national laboratory  kornberg was the first to create an actual picture of how transcription works at a molecular level in the important group of organisms called eukaryotes organisms whose cells have a welldefined nucleus humans and other mammals are included in this group as is ordinary yeast for cells to produce working proteins—a process necessary for life—information stored in dna must first be transcribed into a form readable by the cells internal machinery kornbergs studies have provided an understanding at the atomic level of how the process of transcription occurs and also how it is controlled because the regulation of transcription underlies all aspects of cellular metabolism kornbergs research also helps explain how the process sometimes goes awry

roger david kornberg born april   is an american biochemist and professor of structural biology at stanford university school of medicine kornberg was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry in  for his

collaborations  awards and honors  references education and early lifeedit kornberg was born in st louis missouri the eldest son of biochemist arthur kornberg who won the nobel prize and sylvy ruth levy who was also a biochemist he earned his bachelors degree in chemistry from harvard university in  and his phd in chemical physics from stanford in  supervised by harden m mcconnell careeredit kornberg became a postdoctoral research fellow at the laboratory of molecular biology in cambridge england and then an assistant professor of biological chemistry at harvard medical school in  before moving to his present position as professor of structural biology at stanford medical school in  kornberg is married to biochemist yahli lorch they have three children guy maya and gil researchedit roger d kornberg third from left with andrew fire george smoot dick cheney craig mello and john c mather all organisms are controlled by their genes which are coded by dna which is copied to rna which creates proteins which are sequences of amino acids dna resides in the nucleus when a cell expresses a gene it copies transcribes that genes dna sequence onto a messenger rna mrna sequence mrna is transported out of the nucleus to ribosomes the ribosomes read the mrna and translate the code into the right amino acid sequence to make that genes protein the dna is transcribed to mrna by an enzyme rna polymerase ii with the help of many other proteins using yeast kornberg identified the role of rna polymerase ii and other proteins in transcribing dna and he created threedimensional images of the protein cluster using xray crystallography polymerase ii is used by all organisms with nuclei including humans to transcribe dna kornberg and his research group have made several fundamental discoveries concerning the mechanisms and regulation of eukaryotic transcription while a graduate student working with harden mcconnell at stanford in the late s he discovered the flipflop and lateral diffusion of phospholipids in bilayer membranes while a postdoctoral fellow working with aaron klug and francis crick at the mrc in the s kornberg discovered the nucleosome as the basic protein complex packaging chromosomal dna in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells chromosomal dna is often termed chromatin when it is bound to proteins in this manner reflecting walther flemmings discovery that certain structures within the cell nucleus would absorb dyes and become visible under a microscope within the nucleosome kornberg found that roughly  bp of dna are wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins with yahli lorch kornberg showed that a nucleosome on a promoter prevents the initiation of transcription leading to the recognition of a functional role for the nucleosome which serves as a general gene repressor kornbergs research group at stanford later succeeded in the development of a faithful transcription system from bakers yeast a simple unicellular eukaryote which they then used to isolate in a purified form all of the several dozen proteins required for the transcription process through the work of kornberg and others it has become clear that these protein components are remarkably conserved across the full spectrum of eukaryotes from yeast to human cells using this system kornberg made the major discovery that transmission of gene regulatory signals to the rna polymerase machinery is accomplished by an additional protein complex that they dubbed mediator as noted by the nobel prize committee the great complexity of eukaryotic organisms is actually enabled by the fine interplay between tissuespecific substances enhancers in the dna and mediator the discovery of mediator is therefore a true milestone in the understanding of the transcription process at the same time as kornberg was pursuing these biochemical studies of the transcription process he devoted two decades to the development of methods to visualize the atomic structure of rna polymerase and its associated protein components initially kornberg took advantage of expertise with lipid membranes gained from his graduate studies to devise a technique for the formation of twodimensional protein crystals on lipid bilayers these d crystals could then be analyzed using electron microscopy to derive lowresolution images of the proteins structure eventually kornberg was able to use xray crystallography to solve the dimensional structure of rna polymerase at atomic resolution he has recently extended these studies to obtain structural images of rna polymerase associated with accessory proteins through these studies kornberg has created an actual picture of how transcription works at a molecular level according to the nobel prize committee the truly revolutionary aspect of the picture kornberg has created is that it captures the process of transcription in full flow what we see is an rnastrand being constructed and hence the exact positions of the dna polymerase and rna
