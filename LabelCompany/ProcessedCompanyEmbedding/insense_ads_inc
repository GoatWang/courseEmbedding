related compounds within egyptian antiquity one of the oldest extant incense burners originates from the th dynasty the temple of deirelbahari in egypt contains a series of carvings that depict an expedition for incense the babylonians used incense while offering prayers to divining  oracles incense spread from there to greece and rome incense burners have been found in the indus civilization – bce evidence suggests oils were used mainly for their aroma india also adopted techniques from east asia adapting the inherited formulation to encompass aromatic roots and other indigenous flora this comprised the initial usage of subterranean plant parts within the fabrication of incense new herbs like sarsaparilla seeds frankincense and cypress were used by indians for incense at around  bce ancient china began the use of incense in the religious sense namely for worship incense was used by chinese cultures from neolithic times and became more widespread in the xia shang and zhou dynasties the earliest documented instance of incense utilization comes from the ancient chinese who employed incense composed of herbs and plant products such as cassia cinnamon styrax sandalwood

used in making incense historically there has been a preference for using locally available ingredients for example sage and cedar were used by the indigenous peoples of north america trading in incense materials comprised a major part of commerce along the silk road and other trade routes one notably called the incense route the same could be said for the techniques used to make incense local knowledge and tools were extremely influential on the style but methods were also influenced by migrations of foreigners among them clergy and physicians who were both familiar with incense arts combustible baseedit a räucherkerzchen  a charcoalbased incense cone the combustible base of a direct burning incense mixture not only binds the fragrant material together but also allows the produced incense to burn with a selfsustained ember which propagates slowly and evenly through an entire piece of incense with such regularity that it can be used to mark timecitation needed the base is chosen such that it does not produce a perceptible smell commercially two types of incense base predominate fuel and oxidizer mixtures charcoal or wood powder forms the fuel for the combustion gums such as gum arabic or gum tragacanth are used to bind the mixture together while an oxidizer such as sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate sustains the burning of the incense fragrant materials are combined into the base prior to formation as in the case of powdered incense materials or after formation as in the case of essential oils the formula for the charcoalbased incense is superficially similar to black powder though it lacks the sulfur natural plantbased binders mucilaginous material which can be derived from many botanical sources is mixed with fragrant materials and water the mucilage from the wet binding powder holds the fragrant material together while the cellulose in the powder combusts to form a stable ember when lit the dry binding powder usually comprises about  of the dry weight in the finished incense this includes makko incense powder made from the bark of various trees from the persea such as persea thunbergii xiangnan pi made from the bark of phoebe genus trees such as phoebe nanmu persea zuihoensis jigit a resin based binder used in india laha or dar bark based powders used in nepal tibet and other east asian countries typesedit incense materials are available in various forms and degrees of processing they can generally be separated into directburning and indirectburning types depending on use preference for one form or another varies with culture tradition and personal taste although the production of direct and indirectburning incense are both blended to produce a pleasant smell when burned the two differ in their composition due to the formers requirement for even stable and sustained burning indirectburningedit indirectburning incense also called noncombustible incensebetter source needed is a combination of aromatic ingredients that are not prepared in any particular way or encouraged into any particular form leaving it mostly unsuitable for direct combustion the use of this class of incense requires a separate heat source since it does not generally kindle a fire capable of burning itself and may not ignite at all under normal conditions this incense can vary in the duration of its burning with the texture of the material finer ingredients tend to burn more rapidly while coarsely ground or whole chunks may be consumed very gradually as they have less total surface area the heat is traditionally provided by charcoal or glowing embers in the west the best known incense materials of this type are frankincense and myrrh likely due to their numerous mentions in the christian bible in fact the word for frankincense in many european languages also alludes to any form of incense whole the incense material is burned directly in its raw unprocessed form on top of coal embers powdered or granulated the incense material is broken down into finer bits this incense burns quickly and provides a short period of intense smells paste the powdered or granulated incense material is mixed with a sticky and incombustible binder such as dried fruit honey or a soft resin and then formed to balls or small pastilles these may then be allowed to mature in a controlled environment where the fragrances can commingle and unite much arabian incense also called bukhoor or bakhoor is of this type bakhoor actually refers to frankincense in arabic and japan has a history of kneaded incense called nerikō or awasekō using this method within the eastern orthodox christian tradition raw frankincense is ground into a fine powder and then mixed with various sweetsmelling essential oils directburningedit incense coils hanging from the ceiling of an east asian temple directburning incense also called combustible incensebetter source needed is lit directly by a flame the glowing ember on the incense will continue to smoulder and burn away the rest of the incense without continued application of heat or flame from an outside source directburning incense is either extruded pressed into forms or coated onto a supporting material this class of incense is made from a moldable substrate of fragrant finely ground or liquid incense materials and odourless binder the composition must be adjusted to provide fragrance in the proper concentration and to ensure even burning the following types of directburning incense are commonly encountered though the material itself can take virtually any form according to expediency or whimsy burning incense stick and its smoke coil extruded and shaped into a coil without a core this type of incense is able to burn for an extended period from hours to days and is commonly produced and used by chinese culture cone incense in this form burns relatively fast incense cones were invented in japan in the s cored stick this form of stick incense has a supporting core of bamboo higher quality varieties of this form have fragrant sandalwood cores the core is coated by a thick layer of incense material that burns away with the core this type of incense is commonly produced in india and china when used for worship in chinese folk religion cored incensed sticks are sometimes known as joss sticks solid stick this stick incense has no supporting core and is completely made of incense material easily broken into pieces it allows one to determine the specific amount of incense they wish to burn this is the most commonly produced form of incense in japan and tibet powder the loose incense powder used for making indirect burning incense is sometimes burned without further processing they are typically packed into long trails on top of wood ash using a stencil and burned in special censers or incense clocks paper paper infused with incense folded accordion style lit and blown out examples are carta darmenia and papier darménie rope the incense powder is rolled into paper sheets which are then rolled into ropes twisted tightly then doubled over and twisted again yielding a twostrand rope the larger end is the bight and may be stood vertically in a shallow dish of sand or pebbles the smaller pointed end is lit this type of incense is highly transportable and stays fresh for extremely long periods it has been used for centuries in tibet and nepal the disks of powdered mugwort called moxa sold in chinese shops and herbalists are used in traditional chinese medicine for moxibustion treatment moxa tablets are not incenses the treatment relies on heat rather than fragrance reed diffusingedit a reed diffuser is a form of incense that uses no heat it comes in three parts a bottlecontainer scented essential incense oil and bamboo reeds the incense oil is placed into the container and bamboo reeds are then put into the same container this is done to absorb some of the incense oil as well as to help carry its scent and essence out of the container and into the surrounding air reeds typically have tiny tube openings that run the entire length of the stick oil is absorbed by the reed sticks and carried along the entire reed these are doityourself incense sticks that do not burn and look almost identical to typical incense sticks productionedit this section needs additional citations for verification please

of the athonite orthodox christian tradition are made by powdering frankincense or fir resin mixing it with essential oils floral fragrances are the most common but citrus such as lemon is not uncommon the incense mixture is then rolled out into a slab approximately  cm thick and left until the slab has firmed it is then cut into small cubes coated with clay powder to prevent adhesion and allowed to fully harden and dry in greece this rolled incense resin is called moskolibano and generally comes in either a pink or green colour denoting the fragrance with pink being rose and green being jasmine direct burningedit some incense sticks are uneven in thickness in order to obtain desired combustion qualities attention has to be paid to certain proportions in direct burning incense mixtures oil content resinous materials such as myrrh and frankincense must not exceed the amount of dry materials in the mixture to such a degree that the incense will not smolder and burncitation needed the higher the oil content relative to the dry mass the less likely the mixture is to burn effectivelycitation needed typically the resinous or oily substances are balanced with dry materials such as wood bark and leaf powders oxidizer quantity the amount of chemical oxidizer in gumbound incense must be carefully proportioned if too little the incense will not ignite and if too much the incense will burn too quickly and not produce fragrant smokecitation needed mixture density incense mixtures made with natural binders must not be combined with too much water in mixing or overcompressed while being formed which would result in either uneven air distribution or undesirable density in the mixture causing the incense to burn unevenly too slowly or too quicklycitation needed particulate size the incense mixture has to be well pulverized with similarly sized particulates uneven and large particulates result in uneven burning and inconsistent aroma production when burnedcitation needed binder watersoluble binders such as makko have to be used in the right proportion to ensure that the incense mixture does not crumble when dry but also that the binder does not take up too much of the mixture some kinds of directburning incense are created from incense blanks made of unscented combustible dust immersed into any suitable kind of essential or fragrance oil these are often sold in america by fleamarket and sidewalk vendors who have developed their own styles such items are often known as dipped or handdipped incense this form of incense requires the least skill and equipment to manufacture since the blanks are preformed in china or south east asia then simply scented with essential oils incense mixtures can be extruded or pressed into shapes small quantities of water are combined with the fragrance and incense base mixture and kneaded into a hard dough the incense dough is then pressed into shaped forms to create cone and smaller coiled incense or forced through a hydraulic press for solid stick incense the formed incense is then trimmed and slowly dried incense produced in this fashion has a tendency to warp or become misshapen when improperly dried and as such must be placed in climatecontrolled rooms and rotated several times through the drying process traditionally the bamboo core of cored stick incense is prepared by hand from phyllostachys heterocycla cv pubescens since this species produces thick wood and easily burns to ashes in the incense stick through this process known as splitting the foot of the incense stick the bamboo is trimmed to length soaked peeled and then continuously split in halves until thin sticks of bamboo with square cross sections of less than mm  this process has been largely been replaced by machines in modern incense production in the case of cored incensed sticks several methods are employed to coat the sticks cores with incense mixture paste rolling a wet malleable paste of incense mixture is first rolled into a long thin coil using a paddle then a thin stick is put next to the coil and the stick and paste are rolled together until the stick is centered in the mixture and the desired thickness is achieved the stick is then cut to the desired length and dried powdercoating powdercoating is used mainly to produce cored incense of either larger coil up to  meter in diameter or cored stick forms a bundle of the supporting material typically thin bamboo or sandalwood slivers is soaked in water or a thin waterglue mixture for a short time the thin sticks are then evenly separated then dipped into a tray of incense powder consisting of fragrance materials and occasionally a plantbased binder the dry incense powder is then tossed and piled over the stick while they are spread apart the sticks are then gently rolled and packed to maintain roundness while more incense powder is repeatedly tossed onto the sticks three to four layers of powder are coated onto the sticks forming a  mm thick layer of incense material on the stick the coated incense is then allowed to dry in open air additional coatings of incense mixture can be applied after each period of successive drying incense sticks that are burned in temples of chinese folk religion produced in this fashion can have a thickness between  and  millimeters compression a damp powder is mechanically formed around a cored stick by compression similar to the way uncored sticks are formed this form is becoming more commonly found due to the higher labor cost of producing powdercoated or pasterolled sticks

temple in taipei taiwan incense fragrances can be of such great strength that they obscure other less desirable odours this utility led to the use of incense in funerary ceremonies because the incense could smother the scent of decay another example of this use as well as of religious use is the giant botafumeiro thurible which swings from the ceiling of the cathedral of santiago de compostela it is used in part to mask the scent of the many tired unwashed pilgrims huddled together in the cathedral of santiago de compostela a similar utilitarian use of incense can be found in the postreformation church of england although the ceremonial use of incense was abandoned until the oxford movement it was common to have incense typically frankincense burned before grand occasions when the church would be crowded the frankincense was carried about by a member of the vestry before the service in a vessel called a perfuming pan in iconography of the day this vessel is shown to be elongated and flat with a single long handle on one side it is important to note that the perfuming pan was used instead of the thurible as the latter would have likely offended the protestant

to the slow accumulation of potential carcinogens in a poorly ventilated environment by measuring the levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including benzopyrene within buddhist temples the study found gaseous aliphatic aldehydes which are carcinogenic and mutagenic in incense smoke a survey of risk factors for lung cancer also conducted in taiwan noted an inverse association between incense burning and adenocarcinoma of the lung though the finding was not deemed significant in contrast a study by several asian cancer research centersclarify showed no association was found between exposure to incense burning and respiratory symptoms like chronic cough chronic sputum chronic bronchitis runny nose wheezing asthma allergic rhinitis or pneumonia among the three populations studied ie primary school children their nonsmoking mothers or a group of older nonsmoking female controls incense burning did not affect lung cancer risk among nonsmokers but it significantly reduced risk among smokers even after adjusting for lifetime smoking amount however the researchers qualified the findings by noting that incense burning in the studied population was associated with certain lowcancerrisk dietary habits and concluded that diet can be a significant confounder of epidemiological studies on air pollution and respiratory health although several studies have not shown a link between incense and cancer of the lung many other types of cancer have been directly linked to burning incensespecify a study published in  in the medical journal cancer found that incense use is associated with a statistically significant higher risk of cancers of the upper respiratory tract with the exception of nasopharyngeal cancer those who used incense heavily also had higher rates of a type of cancer called squamouscell carcinoma which refers to tumors that arise in the cells lining the internal and external surfaces of the body the link between incense use and increased cancer risk held when the researchers weighed other factors including cigarette smoking diet and drinking habits the research team noted that this association is consistent with a large number of studies

meaning to burn combustible bouquets were used by the ancient egyptians who employed incense within both pragmatic and mystical capacities incense was burnt to counteract or obscure malodorous products of human habitation but was widely perceived to also deter malevolent demons and appease the gods with its pleasant aroma resin balls were found in many prehistoric egyptian tombs in el mahasna furnishing tangible archaeological substantiation to the prominence of incense and related compounds within egyptian antiquity one of the oldest extant incense burners originates from the th dynasty the temple of deirelbahari in egypt contains a series of carvings that depict an expedition for incense the babylonians used incense while offering prayers to divining  oracles incense spread from there to greece and rome incense burners have been found in the indus civilization – bce evidence suggests oils were used mainly for their aroma india also adopted techniques from east asia adapting the inherited formulation to encompass aromatic roots and other indigenous flora this comprised the initial usage of subterranean plant parts within the fabrication of incense new herbs like sarsaparilla seeds frankincense and cypress were used by indians for incense at around  bce ancient china began the use of incense in the religious sense namely for worship incense was used by chinese cultures from neolithic times and became more widespread in the xia shang and zhou dynasties the earliest documented instance of incense utilization comes from the ancient chinese who employed incense composed of herbs and plant products such as cassia cinnamon styrax sandalwood amongst others as a component of numerous formalized ceremonial rites incense usage reached its peak during the song dynasty with numerous buildings erected specifically for incense ceremonies brought to japan in the th century by korean buddhist monks who used the mystical aromas in their purification rites the delicate scents of koh highquality japanese incense became a source of amusement and entertainment with nobles in the imperial court during the heian era  years later during the th century shogunate a samurai warrior might perfume his helmet and armor with incense to achieve an aura of invincibility as well as to make a noble gesture to whomever might take his head in battle it wasnt until the

and white indian sandalwood powder santalum album a variety of materials have been used in making incense historically there has been a preference for using locally available ingredients for example sage and cedar were used by the indigenous peoples of north america trading in incense materials comprised a major part of commerce along the silk road and other trade routes one notably called the incense route the same could be said for the techniques used to make incense local knowledge and tools were extremely influential on the style but methods were also influenced by migrations of foreigners among them clergy and physicians who were both familiar with incense arts combustible baseedit a räucherkerzchen  a charcoalbased incense cone the combustible base of a direct burning incense mixture not only binds the fragrant material together but also allows the produced incense to burn with a selfsustained ember which propagates slowly and evenly through an entire piece of incense with such regularity that it can be used to mark timecitation needed the base is chosen such that it does not produce a perceptible smell commercially two types of incense base predominate fuel and oxidizer mixtures charcoal or wood powder forms the fuel for the combustion gums such as gum arabic or gum tragacanth are used to bind the mixture together while an oxidizer such as sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate sustains the burning of the incense fragrant materials are combined into the base prior to formation as in the case of powdered incense materials or after formation as in the case of essential oils the formula for the charcoalbased incense is superficially similar to black powder though it lacks the sulfur natural plantbased binders mucilaginous material which can be derived from many botanical sources is mixed with fragrant materials and water the mucilage from the wet binding powder holds the fragrant material together while the cellulose in the powder combusts to form a stable ember when lit the dry binding powder usually comprises about  of the dry weight in the finished incense this includes makko incense powder made from the bark of various trees from the persea such as persea thunbergii xiangnan pi made from the bark of phoebe genus trees such as phoebe nanmu persea zuihoensis jigit a resin based binder used in india laha or dar bark based powders used in nepal tibet and other east asian countries typesedit incense materials are available in various forms and degrees of processing they can generally be separated into directburning and indirectburning types depending on use preference for one form or another varies with culture tradition and personal taste although the production of direct and indirectburning incense are both blended to produce a pleasant smell when burned the two differ in their composition due to the formers requirement for even stable and sustained burning indirectburningedit indirectburning incense also called noncombustible incensebetter source needed is a combination of aromatic ingredients that are not prepared in any particular way or encouraged into any particular form leaving it mostly unsuitable for direct combustion the use of this class of incense requires a separate heat source since it does not generally kindle a fire capable of burning itself and may not ignite at all under normal conditions this incense can vary in the duration of its burning with the texture of the material finer ingredients tend to burn more rapidly while coarsely ground or whole chunks may be consumed very gradually as they have less total surface area the heat is traditionally provided by charcoal or glowing embers in the west the best known incense materials of this type are frankincense and myrrh likely due to their numerous mentions in the christian bible in fact the word for frankincense in many european languages also alludes to any form of incense whole the incense material is burned directly in its raw unprocessed form on top of coal embers powdered or granulated the incense material is broken down into finer bits this incense burns quickly and provides a short period of intense smells paste the powdered or granulated incense material is mixed with a sticky and incombustible binder such as dried fruit honey or a soft resin and then formed to balls or small pastilles these may then be allowed to mature in a controlled environment where the fragrances can commingle and unite much arabian incense also called bukhoor or bakhoor is of this type bakhoor actually refers to frankincense in arabic and japan has a history of kneaded incense called nerikō or awasekō using this method within the eastern orthodox christian tradition raw frankincense is ground into a fine powder and then mixed with various sweetsmelling essential oils directburningedit incense coils hanging from the ceiling of an east asian temple directburning incense also called combustible incensebetter source needed is lit directly by a flame the glowing ember on the incense will continue to smoulder and burn away the rest of the incense without continued application of heat or flame from an outside source directburning incense is either extruded pressed into forms or coated onto a supporting material this class of incense is made from a moldable substrate of fragrant finely ground or liquid incense materials and odourless binder the composition must be adjusted to provide fragrance in the proper concentration and to ensure even burning the following types of directburning incense are commonly encountered though the material itself can take virtually any form according to expediency or whimsy burning incense stick and its smoke coil extruded and shaped into a coil without a core this type of incense is able to burn for an extended period from hours to days and is commonly produced and used by chinese culture cone incense in this form burns relatively fast incense cones were invented in japan in the s cored stick this form of stick incense has a supporting core of bamboo higher quality varieties of this form have fragrant sandalwood cores the core is coated by a thick layer of incense material that burns away with the core this type of incense is commonly produced in india and china when used for worship in chinese folk religion cored incensed sticks are sometimes known as joss sticks solid stick this stick incense has no supporting core and is completely made of incense material easily broken into pieces it allows one to determine the specific amount of incense they wish to burn this is the most commonly produced form of incense in japan and tibet powder the loose incense powder used for making indirect burning incense is sometimes burned without further processing they are typically packed into long trails on top of wood ash using a stencil and burned in special censers or incense clocks paper paper infused with incense folded accordion style lit and blown out examples are carta darmenia and papier darménie rope the incense powder is rolled into paper sheets which are then rolled into ropes twisted tightly then doubled over and twisted again yielding a twostrand rope the larger end is the bight and may be stood vertically in a shallow dish of sand or pebbles the smaller pointed end is lit this type of incense is highly transportable and stays fresh for extremely long periods it has been used for centuries in tibet and nepal the disks of powdered mugwort called moxa sold in chinese shops and herbalists are used in traditional chinese medicine for moxibustion treatment moxa tablets are not incenses the treatment relies on heat rather than fragrance reed diffusingedit a reed diffuser is a form of incense that uses no heat it comes in three parts a bottlecontainer scented essential incense oil and bamboo reeds the incense oil is placed into the container and bamboo reeds are then put into the same container this is done to absorb some of the incense oil as well as to help carry its scent and essence out of the container and into the surrounding air reeds typically have tiny tube openings that run the entire length of the stick oil is absorbed by the reed sticks and carried along the entire reed these are doityourself incense sticks that do not burn and look almost identical

mixing it with essential oils floral fragrances are the most common but citrus such as lemon is not uncommon the incense mixture is then rolled out into a slab approximately  cm thick and left until the slab has firmed it is then cut into small cubes coated with clay powder to prevent adhesion and allowed to fully harden and dry in greece this rolled incense resin is called moskolibano and generally comes in either a pink or green colour denoting the fragrance with pink being rose and green being jasmine direct burningedit some incense sticks are uneven in thickness in order to obtain desired combustion qualities attention has to be paid to certain proportions in direct burning incense mixtures oil content resinous materials such as myrrh and frankincense must not exceed the amount of dry materials in the mixture to such a degree that the incense will not smolder and burncitation needed the higher the oil content relative to the dry mass the less likely the mixture is to burn effectivelycitation needed typically the resinous or oily substances are balanced with dry materials such as wood bark and leaf powders oxidizer quantity the amount of chemical oxidizer in gumbound incense must be carefully proportioned if too little the incense will not ignite and if too much the incense will burn too quickly and not produce fragrant smokecitation needed mixture density incense mixtures made with natural binders must not be combined with too much water in mixing or overcompressed while being formed which would result in either uneven air distribution or undesirable density in the mixture causing the incense to burn unevenly too slowly or too quicklycitation needed particulate size the incense mixture has to be well pulverized with similarly sized particulates uneven and large particulates result in uneven burning and inconsistent aroma production when burnedcitation needed binder watersoluble binders such as makko have to be used in the right proportion to ensure that the incense mixture does not crumble when dry but also that the binder does not take up too much of the mixture some kinds of directburning incense are created from incense blanks made of unscented combustible dust immersed into any suitable kind of essential or fragrance oil these are often sold in america by fleamarket and sidewalk vendors who have developed their own styles such items are often known as dipped or handdipped incense this form of incense requires the least skill and equipment to manufacture since the blanks are preformed in china or south east asia then simply scented with essential oils incense mixtures can be extruded or pressed into shapes small quantities of water are combined with the fragrance and incense base mixture and kneaded into a hard dough the incense dough is then pressed into shaped forms to create cone and smaller coiled incense or forced through a hydraulic press for solid stick incense the formed incense is then trimmed and slowly dried incense produced in this fashion has a tendency to warp or become misshapen when improperly dried and as such must be placed in climatecontrolled rooms and rotated several times through the drying process traditionally the bamboo core of cored stick incense is prepared by hand from phyllostachys heterocycla cv pubescens since this species produces thick wood and easily burns to ashes in the incense stick through this process known as splitting the foot of the incense stick the bamboo is trimmed to length soaked peeled and then continuously split in halves until thin sticks of bamboo with square cross sections of less than mm  this process has been largely been replaced by machines in modern incense production in the case of cored incensed sticks several methods are employed to coat the sticks cores with incense mixture paste rolling a wet malleable paste of incense mixture is first rolled into a long thin coil using a paddle then a thin stick is put next to the coil and the stick and paste are rolled together until the stick is centered in the mixture and the desired thickness is achieved the stick is then cut to the desired length and dried powdercoating powdercoating is used mainly to produce cored incense of either larger coil up to  meter in diameter or cored stick forms a bundle of the supporting material typically thin bamboo or sandalwood slivers is soaked in water or a thin waterglue mixture for a short time the thin sticks are then evenly separated then dipped into a tray of incense powder consisting of fragrance materials and occasionally a plantbased binder the dry incense powder is then tossed and piled over the stick while they are spread apart the sticks are then gently rolled and packed to maintain roundness while more incense powder is repeatedly tossed onto the sticks three to four layers of powder are coated onto the sticks forming a  mm thick layer of incense material on the stick the coated incense is then allowed to dry in open air additional coatings of incense mixture can be applied after each period of successive drying incense sticks that are burned in temples of chinese folk religion produced in this fashion can have a thickness between  and  millimeters compression a damp powder is mechanically formed around a cored stick by compression similar to the way uncored sticks are formed this form is becoming more commonly found due to the higher labor cost of producing powdercoated or pasterolled sticks joss sticksedit joss sticks in the temple of literature hanoi in hanoi vietnam joss sticks are the name

movement it was common to have incense typically frankincense burned before grand occasions when the church would be crowded the frankincense was carried about by a member of the vestry before the service in a vessel called a perfuming pan in iconography of the day this vessel is shown to be elongated and flat with a single long handle on one side it is important to note that the perfuming pan was used instead of the thurible as the latter would have likely offended the protestant sensibilities of the th and th centuries the regular burning of direct combustion incense has been used for chronological measurement in incense clocks these devices can range from a simple trail of incense material calibrated to burn in a specific time period to elaborate and ornate instruments with bells or gongs designed to involve and captivate several of the senses incense made from materials such as citronella can repel mosquitoes and other irritating distracting or pestilential insects this use has been deployed in concert with religious uses by zen buddhists who claim that the incense that is part of their meditative practice is designed to keep bothersome insects from distracting the practitioner currently more effective pyrethroidbased mosquito repellent incense is widely available in asia papier darménie was originally sold as a disinfectant as well as for the fragrance incense is also used often by people who smoke indoors and do not want the scent to linger aesthetic many people burn incense to appreciate its smell without assigning any other specific significance to it in the same way that the foregoing items can be produced or consumed solely for the contemplation or enjoyment of the refined sensory experience this use is perhaps best exemplified in the kōdō  where frequently costly raw incense materials such as agarwood are appreciated in a formal setting religious main article religious use of incense use of incense in religion is prevalent in many cultures and may have their roots in the practical and aesthetic uses considering that many religions with not much else in common all use incense one common motif is incense as a form of sacrificial offering to a deity such use was common in judaic worship  and remains in use for example in the catholic orthodox and anglican churches taoist and buddhist chinese jingxiang  offer incense to ancestorsgods etc aphrodisiac incense have been used as aphrodisiac in some cultures both ancient greek and ancient egyptian mythology suggest the usage of incense by goddesses and nymphs incense are thought to heighten sexual desires and sexual attraction timekeeper incense  are commonly referred to as incense clocks are used to time social medical and religious practices in parts of eastern asia primarily used in buddhism as a timer of mediation and prayer different types of incense burn at different rates therefore different incense are used for different practices the times that incense can burn ranges from minutes to months healing stone cleanser incense are used to cleanse and restore energy in healing stones the technique used for this is called “smudging” and is done by holding a healing stone over the smoke of a burning incense for  to  seconds many people believe that this process not only restores energy but eliminates negative energy health risks from incense smokeedit incense smoke contains various contaminants including gaseous pollutants such as carbon monoxide co nitrogen oxides nox sulfur oxides sox volatile organic compounds vocs – and absorbed toxic pollutants polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and toxic metals the solid particles range between  and  nm the emission rate decreases in the row indian sandalwood  japanese aloeswood  taiwanese aloeswood  smokeless sandalwood research carried out in taiwan in  linked the burning of incense sticks to the slow accumulation of potential carcinogens in a poorly ventilated environment by measuring the levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including benzopyrene within buddhist temples the study found gaseous aliphatic aldehydes which are carcinogenic and mutagenic in incense smoke a survey of risk factors for lung cancer also conducted in taiwan noted an inverse association between incense burning and adenocarcinoma of the lung though the finding was not deemed significant in contrast a study by several asian cancer research centersclarify showed no association was found between exposure to incense burning and respiratory symptoms like chronic cough chronic sputum chronic bronchitis runny nose wheezing asthma allergic rhinitis or pneumonia among the three populations studied ie primary school children their nonsmoking mothers or a group of older nonsmoking female controls incense burning did not affect lung cancer risk among nonsmokers but it significantly reduced risk among smokers even after adjusting for lifetime smoking amount however the researchers qualified the findings by noting that incense burning in the studied population was associated with certain lowcancerrisk dietary habits and concluded that diet can be a significant confounder of epidemiological studies on air pollution and respiratory health although several studies have not shown a link between incense and cancer of the lung many other types of cancer have been directly linked to burning incensespecify a study published in  in the medical journal cancer found that incense use is associated with a statistically significant higher risk of cancers of the upper respiratory tract with the exception of nasopharyngeal cancer those who used incense heavily also had higher rates of a type of cancer called squamouscell carcinoma which refers to tumors that arise in the cells lining the internal and external surfaces of the body the link between incense use and increased cancer risk held when the researchers weighed other factors including cigarette smoking diet and drinking habits the research team noted that this association is consistent with a large number of studies identifying carcinogens in incense smoke and given the widespread and sometimes involuntary exposure to smoke from burning incense these findings carry significant public health implications in  the south china university of technology found toxicity of incense to chinese hamsters ovary cells to be even higher than cigarettes  frankincense has been shown to cause antidepressive behavior in mice it activated the poorly understood ion channels in the brain to alleviate anxiety and depression see

at the longhua temple incense is aromatic biotic material which releases fragrant smoke when burned the term refers to the material itself rather than to the aroma that it produces incense is used for aesthetic reasons and in therapy meditation and ceremony it may also be used as a simple deodorant or insectifuge incense is composed of aromatic plant materials often combined with essential oils the forms taken by incense differ with the underlying culture and have changed with advances in technology and increasing diversity in the reasons for burning it incense can generally be separated into two main types indirectburning and directburning indirectburning incense or noncombustible incense is not capable of burning on its own and requires a separate heat source directburning incense or

meaning to burn combustible bouquets were used by the ancient egyptians who employed incense within both pragmatic and mystical capacities incense was burnt to counteract or obscure malodorous products of human habitation but was widely perceived to also deter malevolent demons and appease the gods with its pleasant aroma resin balls were found in many prehistoric egyptian tombs in el mahasna furnishing tangible archaeological substantiation to the prominence of incense and related compounds within egyptian antiquity one of the oldest extant incense burners originates from the th dynasty the temple of deirelbahari in egypt contains a series of carvings that depict an expedition for incense the babylonians used incense while offering prayers to divining  oracles incense spread from there to greece and rome incense burners have been found in the indus civilization – bce evidence suggests oils were used mainly for their aroma india also adopted techniques from east asia adapting the inherited formulation to encompass aromatic roots and other indigenous flora this comprised the initial usage of subterranean plant parts within the fabrication of incense new herbs like sarsaparilla seeds frankincense and cypress were used by indians for incense at around  bce ancient china began the use of incense in the religious sense namely for worship incense was used by chinese cultures from neolithic times and became more widespread in the xia shang and zhou dynasties the earliest documented instance of incense utilization comes from the ancient chinese who employed incense composed of herbs and plant products such as cassia cinnamon styrax sandalwood amongst others as a component of numerous formalized ceremonial rites incense usage reached its peak during the song dynasty with numerous buildings erected specifically for incense ceremonies brought to japan in the th century by korean buddhist monks who used the mystical aromas in their purification rites the delicate scents of koh highquality japanese incense became a source of amusement and entertainment with nobles in the imperial court during the heian era  years later during the th century shogunate a samurai warrior might perfume his helmet and armor with incense to achieve an aura of invincibility as well as to make a noble gesture to whomever might take his head in battle it wasnt until the muromachi era during the th and th century that incense appreciation kōdō spread to the upper and middle classes of japanese society compositionedit some commonly used raw incense and incensemaking

and white indian sandalwood powder santalum album a variety of materials have been used in making incense historically there has been a preference for using locally available ingredients for example sage and cedar were used by the indigenous peoples of north america trading in incense materials comprised a major part of commerce along the silk road and other trade routes one notably called the incense route the same could be said for the techniques used to make incense local knowledge and tools were extremely influential on the style but methods were also influenced by migrations of foreigners among them clergy and physicians who were both familiar with incense arts combustible baseedit a räucherkerzchen  a charcoalbased incense cone the combustible base of a direct burning incense mixture not only binds the fragrant material together but also allows the produced incense to burn with a selfsustained ember which propagates slowly and evenly through an entire piece of incense with such regularity that it can be used to mark timecitation needed the base is chosen such that it does not produce a perceptible smell commercially two types of incense base predominate fuel and oxidizer mixtures charcoal or wood powder forms the fuel for the combustion gums such as gum arabic or gum tragacanth are used to bind the mixture together while an oxidizer such as sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate sustains the burning of the incense fragrant materials are combined into the base prior to formation as in the case of powdered incense materials or after formation as in the case of essential oils the formula for the charcoalbased incense is superficially similar to black powder though it lacks the sulfur natural plantbased binders mucilaginous material which can be derived from many botanical sources is mixed with fragrant materials and water the mucilage from the wet binding powder holds the fragrant material together while the cellulose in the powder combusts to form a stable ember when lit the dry binding powder usually comprises about  of the dry weight in the finished incense this includes makko incense powder made from the bark of various trees from the persea such as persea thunbergii xiangnan pi made from the bark of phoebe genus trees such as phoebe nanmu persea zuihoensis jigit a resin based binder used in india laha or dar bark based powders used in nepal tibet and other east asian countries typesedit incense materials are available in various forms and degrees of processing they can generally be separated into directburning and indirectburning types depending on use preference for one form or another varies with culture tradition and personal taste although the production of direct and indirectburning incense are both blended to produce a pleasant smell when burned the two differ in their composition due to the formers requirement for even stable and sustained burning indirectburningedit indirectburning incense also called noncombustible incensebetter source needed is a combination of aromatic ingredients that are not prepared in any particular way or encouraged into any particular form leaving it mostly unsuitable for direct combustion the use of this class of incense requires a separate heat source since it does not generally kindle a fire capable of burning itself and may not ignite at all under normal conditions this incense can vary in the duration of its burning with the texture of the material finer ingredients tend to burn more rapidly while coarsely ground or whole chunks may be consumed very gradually as they have less total surface area the heat is traditionally provided by charcoal or glowing embers in the west the best known incense materials of this type are frankincense and myrrh likely due to their numerous mentions in the christian bible in fact the word for frankincense in many european languages also alludes to any form of incense whole the incense material is burned directly in its raw unprocessed form on top of coal embers powdered or granulated the incense material is broken down into finer bits this incense burns quickly and provides a short period of intense smells paste the powdered or granulated incense material is mixed with a sticky and incombustible binder such as dried fruit honey or a soft resin and then formed to balls or small pastilles these may then be allowed to mature in a controlled environment where the fragrances can commingle and unite much arabian incense also called bukhoor or bakhoor is of this type bakhoor actually refers to frankincense in arabic and japan has a history of kneaded incense called nerikō or awasekō using this method within the eastern orthodox christian tradition raw frankincense is ground into a fine powder and then mixed with various sweetsmelling essential oils directburningedit incense coils hanging from the ceiling of an east asian temple directburning incense also called combustible incensebetter source needed is lit directly by a flame the glowing ember on the incense will continue to smoulder and burn away the rest of the incense without continued application of heat or flame from an outside source directburning incense is either extruded pressed into forms or coated onto a supporting material this class of incense is made from a moldable substrate of fragrant finely ground or liquid incense materials and odourless binder the composition must be adjusted to provide fragrance in the proper concentration and to ensure even burning the following types of directburning incense are commonly encountered though the material itself can take virtually any form according to expediency or whimsy burning incense stick and its smoke coil extruded and shaped into a coil without a core this type of incense is able to burn for an extended period from hours to days and is commonly produced and used by chinese culture cone incense in this form burns relatively fast incense cones were invented in japan in the s cored stick this form of stick incense has a supporting core of bamboo higher quality varieties of this form have fragrant sandalwood cores the core is coated by a thick layer of incense material that burns away with the core this type of incense is commonly produced in india and china when used for worship in chinese folk religion cored incensed sticks are sometimes known as joss sticks solid stick this stick incense has no supporting core and is completely made of incense material easily broken into pieces it allows one to determine the specific amount of incense they wish to burn this is the most commonly produced form of incense in japan and tibet powder the loose incense powder used for making indirect burning incense is sometimes burned without further processing they are typically packed into long trails on top of wood ash using a stencil and burned in special censers or incense clocks paper paper infused with incense folded accordion style lit and blown out examples are carta darmenia and papier darménie rope the incense powder is rolled into paper sheets which are then rolled into ropes twisted tightly then doubled over and twisted again yielding a twostrand rope the larger end is the bight and may be stood vertically in a shallow dish of sand or pebbles the smaller pointed end is lit this type of incense is highly transportable and stays fresh for extremely long periods it has been used for centuries in tibet and nepal the disks of powdered mugwort called moxa sold in chinese shops and herbalists are used in traditional chinese medicine for moxibustion treatment moxa tablets are not incenses the treatment relies on heat rather than fragrance reed diffusingedit a reed diffuser is a form of incense that uses no heat it comes in three parts a bottlecontainer scented essential incense oil and bamboo reeds the incense oil is placed into the container and bamboo reeds are then put into the same container this is done to absorb some of the incense oil as well as to help carry its scent and essence out of the container and into the surrounding air reeds typically have tiny tube openings that run the entire length of the stick oil is absorbed by the reed sticks and carried along the entire reed these are doityourself incense sticks that do not burn and look almost identical

a binder to form a paste which for direct burning incense are then cut and dried into pellets incense of the athonite orthodox christian tradition are made by powdering frankincense or fir resin mixing it with essential oils floral fragrances are the most common but citrus such as lemon is not uncommon the incense mixture is then rolled out into a slab approximately  cm thick and left until the slab has firmed it is then cut into small cubes coated with clay powder to prevent adhesion and allowed to fully harden and dry in greece this rolled incense resin is called moskolibano and generally comes in either a pink or green colour denoting the fragrance with pink being rose and green being jasmine direct burningedit some incense sticks are uneven in thickness in order to obtain desired combustion qualities attention has to be paid to certain proportions in direct burning incense mixtures oil content resinous materials such as myrrh and frankincense must not exceed the amount of dry materials in the mixture to such a degree that the incense will not smolder and burncitation needed the higher the oil content relative to the dry mass the less likely the mixture is to burn effectivelycitation needed typically the resinous or oily substances are balanced with dry materials such as wood bark and leaf powders oxidizer quantity the amount of chemical oxidizer in gumbound incense must be carefully proportioned if too little the incense will not ignite and if too much the incense will burn too quickly and not produce fragrant smokecitation needed mixture density incense mixtures made with natural binders must not be combined with too much water in mixing or overcompressed while being formed which would result in either uneven air distribution or undesirable density in the mixture causing the incense to burn unevenly too slowly or too quicklycitation needed particulate size the incense mixture has to be well pulverized with similarly sized particulates uneven and large particulates result in uneven burning and inconsistent aroma production when burnedcitation needed binder watersoluble binders such as makko have to be used in the right proportion to ensure that the incense mixture does not crumble when dry but also that the binder does not take up too much of the mixture some kinds of directburning incense are created from incense blanks made of unscented combustible dust immersed into any suitable kind of essential or fragrance oil these are often sold in america by fleamarket and sidewalk vendors who have developed their own styles such items are often known as dipped or handdipped incense this form of incense requires the least skill and equipment to manufacture since the blanks are preformed in china or south east asia then simply scented with essential oils incense mixtures can be extruded or pressed into shapes small quantities of water are combined with the fragrance and incense base mixture and kneaded into a hard dough the incense dough is then pressed into shaped forms to create cone and smaller coiled incense or forced through a hydraulic press for solid stick incense the formed incense is then trimmed and slowly dried incense produced in this fashion has a tendency to warp or become misshapen when improperly dried and as such must be placed in climatecontrolled rooms and rotated several times through the drying process traditionally the bamboo core of cored stick incense is prepared by hand from phyllostachys heterocycla cv pubescens since this species produces thick wood and easily burns to ashes in the incense stick through this process known as splitting the foot of the incense stick the bamboo is trimmed to length soaked peeled and then continuously split in halves until thin sticks of bamboo with square cross sections of less than mm  this process has been largely been replaced by machines in modern incense production in the case of cored incensed sticks several methods are employed to coat the sticks cores with incense mixture paste rolling a wet malleable paste of incense mixture is first rolled into a long thin coil using a paddle then a thin stick is put next to the coil and the stick and paste are rolled together until the stick is centered in the mixture and the desired thickness is achieved the stick is then cut to the desired length and dried powdercoating powdercoating is used mainly to produce cored incense of either larger coil up to  meter in diameter or cored stick forms a bundle of the supporting material typically thin bamboo or sandalwood slivers is soaked in water or a thin waterglue mixture for a short time the thin sticks are then evenly separated then dipped into a tray of incense powder consisting of fragrance materials and occasionally a plantbased binder the dry incense powder is then tossed and piled over the stick while they are spread apart the sticks are then gently rolled and packed to maintain roundness while more incense powder is repeatedly tossed onto the sticks three to four layers of powder are coated onto the sticks forming a  mm thick layer of incense material on the stick the coated incense is then allowed to dry in open air additional coatings of incense mixture can be applied after each period of successive drying incense sticks that are burned in temples of chinese folk religion produced in this fashion can have a thickness between  and  millimeters compression a damp powder is mechanically formed around a cored stick by compression similar to the way uncored sticks are formed this form is becoming more commonly found due to the higher labor cost of producing powdercoated or pasterolled sticks joss sticksedit joss sticks in the temple of literature hanoi in hanoi vietnam joss sticks are the name given to incense sticks used for a variety of purposes associated with ritual and religious devotion in many parts of east asia south asia and southeast asia among ethnic chinese and chineseinfluenced communities they are traditionally burned before the threshold of a home or business before an image of a chinese popular religion divinity or spirit of place or in small and humble or large and elaborate shrine found at the main entrance to each and every village here the earth god is propitiated in the hope of bringing wealth and health to the village they can also be burned in front of a

also burned at temples across many parts of east south and southeast asia big dragon joss sticks jossstick burning is an everyday practice in traditional chinese religion there are many different types of joss sticks used for different purposes or on different festive days many of them are long and thin and are mostly colored yellow red and more rarely black thick joss sticks are used for special ceremonies such as funerals spiral joss sticks are also used on a regular basis which are found hanging above temple ceilings with burn times that are exceedingly long in some states such as taiwan singapore or malaysia where they celebrate the ghost festival large pillarlike dragon joss sticks are sometimes used these generate such a massive amount of smoke and heat that they are only ever burned outside unpacked incense sticks in buddhisttaoist shrine in malaysia chinese incense sticks for use in popular religion are generally without aroma or only the slightest trace of jasmine or rose since it is the smoke not the scent which is important in conveying the prayers of the faithful to heaven they are composed of the dried powdered bark of a nonscented species of cinnamon native to cambodia cinnamomum cambodianumcitation needed inexpensive packs of  are often found for sale in chinese supermarkets despite the fact that they contain no sandalwood at all they often include the chinese character for sandalwood on the label as a generic term for incense highly scented chinese incense sticks are only used by some buddhists these are often quite expensive due to the use of large amounts of sandalwood aloeswood or floral scents used the sandalwood used in chinese incenses does not come from india its native home but rather from groves planted within chinese territory sites belonging to tzu chi chung tai shan dharma drum mountain xingtian temple or city of ten thousand buddhas do not use incense burning incenseedit for indirectburning incense pieces of the incense are burned by placing them directly on top of a heat source or on a hot metal plate in a censer or thurible in japan a similar censer called a egōro  is used by several buddhist sects the egōro is usually made of brass with a long handle and no chain instead of charcoal makkō powder is poured into a depression made in a bed of ash the makkō is lit and the incense mixture is burned on

the cathedral of santiago de compostela a similar utilitarian use of incense can be found in the postreformation church of england although the ceremonial use of incense was abandoned until the oxford

service in a vessel called a perfuming pan in iconography of the day this vessel is shown to be elongated and flat with a single long handle on one side it is important to note that the perfuming pan was used instead of the thurible as the latter would have likely offended the protestant sensibilities of the th and th centuries the regular burning of direct combustion incense has been used for chronological measurement in incense clocks these devices can range from a simple trail of incense material calibrated to burn in a specific time period to elaborate and ornate instruments with bells

smokeless sandalwood research carried out in taiwan in  linked the burning of incense sticks to the slow accumulation of potential carcinogens in a poorly ventilated environment by measuring the levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including benzopyrene within buddhist temples the study found gaseous aliphatic aldehydes which are carcinogenic and mutagenic in incense smoke a survey of risk factors for lung cancer also conducted in taiwan noted an inverse association between incense burning and adenocarcinoma of the lung though the finding was not deemed significant in contrast a study by several asian cancer research centersclarify showed no association was found between exposure to incense burning and respiratory symptoms like chronic cough chronic sputum chronic bronchitis runny nose wheezing asthma allergic rhinitis or pneumonia among the three populations studied ie primary school children their nonsmoking mothers or a group of older nonsmoking female controls incense burning did not affect lung cancer risk among nonsmokers but it significantly reduced risk among smokers even after adjusting for lifetime smoking amount however the researchers qualified the findings by noting that incense burning in the studied population was associated with certain lowcancerrisk dietary habits and concluded that diet can be a significant confounder of epidemiological studies on air pollution and respiratory health although several studies have not shown a link between incense and cancer of the lung many other types of cancer have been directly linked to burning incensespecify a study published in  in the medical journal cancer found that incense use is associated with a statistically significant higher risk of cancers of the upper respiratory tract with the exception of nasopharyngeal cancer those who used incense heavily also had higher rates of a type of cancer called squamouscell carcinoma which refers to tumors that arise in the cells lining the internal and external surfaces of the body the link between incense use and increased cancer risk held when the researchers weighed other factors including cigarette smoking diet and drinking habits the research team noted that this association is consistent with a large number of studies identifying carcinogens in incense smoke and given the widespread and sometimes involuntary exposure to smoke from burning incense these findings carry significant public health implications in  the south china university of technology found toxicity of incense to chinese hamsters ovary cells to be even

meaning to burn combustible bouquets were used by the ancient egyptians who employed incense within both pragmatic and mystical capacities incense was burnt to counteract or obscure malodorous products of human habitation but was widely perceived to also deter malevolent demons and appease the gods with its pleasant aroma resin balls were found in many prehistoric egyptian tombs in el mahasna furnishing tangible archaeological substantiation to the prominence of incense and related compounds within egyptian antiquity one of the oldest extant incense burners originates from the th dynasty the temple of deirelbahari in egypt contains a series of carvings that depict an expedition for incense the babylonians used incense while offering prayers to divining  oracles incense spread from there to greece and rome incense burners have been found in the indus civilization – bce evidence suggests oils were used mainly for their aroma india also adopted techniques from east asia adapting the inherited formulation to encompass aromatic roots and other indigenous flora this comprised the initial usage of subterranean plant parts within the fabrication of incense new herbs like sarsaparilla seeds frankincense and cypress were used by indians for incense at around  bce ancient china began the use of incense in the religious sense namely for worship incense was used by chinese cultures from neolithic times and became more widespread in the xia shang and zhou dynasties the earliest documented instance of incense utilization comes from the ancient chinese who employed incense composed of herbs and plant products such as cassia cinnamon styrax sandalwood amongst others as a component of numerous formalized ceremonial rites incense usage reached its peak during the song dynasty with numerous buildings erected specifically for incense ceremonies brought to japan in the th century by korean buddhist monks who used the mystical aromas in their purification rites the delicate scents of koh highquality japanese incense became a source of amusement and entertainment with nobles in the imperial court during the heian era  years later during the th century shogunate a

and white indian sandalwood powder santalum album a variety of materials have been used in making incense historically there has been a preference for using locally available ingredients for example sage and cedar were used by the indigenous peoples of north america trading in incense materials comprised a major part of commerce along the silk road and other trade routes one notably called the incense route the same could be said for the techniques used to make incense local knowledge and tools were extremely influential on the style but methods were also influenced by migrations of foreigners among them clergy and physicians who were both familiar with incense arts combustible baseedit a räucherkerzchen  a charcoalbased incense cone the combustible base of a direct burning incense mixture not only binds the fragrant material together but also allows the produced incense to burn with a selfsustained ember which propagates slowly and evenly through an entire piece of incense with such regularity that it can be used to mark timecitation needed the base is chosen such that it does not produce a perceptible smell commercially two types of incense base predominate fuel and oxidizer mixtures charcoal or wood powder forms the fuel for the combustion gums such as gum arabic or gum tragacanth are used to bind the mixture together while an oxidizer such as sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate sustains the burning of the incense fragrant materials are combined into the base prior to formation as in the case of powdered incense materials or after formation as in the case of essential oils the formula for the charcoalbased incense is superficially similar to black powder though it lacks the sulfur natural plantbased binders mucilaginous material which can be derived from many botanical sources is mixed with fragrant materials and water the mucilage from the wet binding powder holds the fragrant material together while the cellulose in the powder combusts to form a stable ember when lit the dry binding powder usually comprises about  of the dry weight in the finished incense this includes makko incense powder made from the bark of various trees from the persea such as persea thunbergii xiangnan pi made from the bark of phoebe genus trees such as phoebe nanmu persea zuihoensis jigit a resin based binder used in india laha or dar bark based powders used in nepal tibet and other east asian countries typesedit incense materials are available in various forms and degrees of processing they can generally be separated into directburning and indirectburning types depending on use preference for one form or another varies with culture tradition and personal taste although the production of direct and indirectburning incense are both blended to produce a pleasant smell when burned the two differ in their composition due to the formers requirement for even stable and sustained burning indirectburningedit indirectburning incense also called noncombustible incensebetter source needed is a combination of aromatic ingredients that are not prepared in any particular way or encouraged into any particular form leaving it mostly unsuitable for direct combustion the use of this class of incense requires a separate heat source since it does not generally kindle a fire capable of burning itself and may not ignite at all under normal conditions this incense can vary in the duration of its burning with the texture of the material finer ingredients tend to burn more rapidly while coarsely ground or whole chunks may be consumed very gradually as they have less total surface area the heat is traditionally provided by charcoal or glowing embers in the west the best known incense materials of this type are frankincense and myrrh likely due to their numerous mentions in the christian bible in fact the word for frankincense in many european languages also alludes to any form of incense whole the incense material is burned directly in its raw unprocessed form on top of coal embers powdered or granulated the incense material is broken down into finer bits this incense burns quickly and provides a short period of intense smells paste the powdered or granulated incense material is mixed with a sticky and incombustible binder such as dried fruit honey or a soft resin and then formed to balls or small pastilles these may then be allowed to mature in a controlled environment where the fragrances can commingle and unite much arabian incense also called bukhoor or bakhoor is of this type bakhoor actually refers to frankincense in arabic and japan has a history of kneaded incense called nerikō or awasekō using this method within the eastern orthodox christian tradition raw frankincense is ground into a fine

from an outside source directburning incense is either extruded pressed into forms or coated onto a supporting material this class of incense is made from a moldable substrate of fragrant finely ground or liquid incense materials and odourless binder the composition must be adjusted to provide fragrance in the proper concentration and to ensure even burning the following types of directburning incense are commonly encountered though the material itself can take virtually any form according to expediency or whimsy burning incense stick and its smoke coil extruded and shaped

tightly then doubled over and twisted again yielding a twostrand rope the larger end is the bight and may be stood vertically in a shallow dish of sand or pebbles the smaller pointed end is lit this

form of incense that uses no heat it comes in three parts a bottlecontainer scented essential incense oil and bamboo reeds the incense oil is placed into the container and bamboo reeds are then put into the same container this is done to absorb some of the incense oil as well as to help carry its scent and essence out of the container and into the surrounding air reeds typically have tiny tube

desired combustion qualities attention has to be paid to certain proportions in direct burning incense mixtures oil content resinous materials such as myrrh and frankincense must not exceed the amount of dry materials in the mixture to such a degree that the incense will not smolder and burncitation needed the higher the oil content relative to the dry mass the less likely the mixture is to burn

incense must be carefully proportioned if too little the incense will not ignite and if too much the incense will burn too quickly and not produce fragrant smokecitation needed mixture density incense mixtures made with natural binders must not be combined with too much water in mixing or overcompressed while being formed which would result in either uneven air distribution or undesirable density in the mixture causing the incense to burn unevenly too slowly or too quicklycitation needed particulate size the incense mixture has to be well pulverized with similarly sized particulates uneven and large particulates result in uneven burning and inconsistent aroma production when burnedcitation needed binder watersoluble binders such as makko have to be used in the right proportion to ensure that the incense mixture does not crumble when dry but also that the binder does not take up too much of the mixture some kinds of directburning incense are created from incense blanks made of unscented combustible dust immersed into any suitable kind of essential or fragrance oil these are often sold in america by fleamarket and sidewalk vendors who have developed their own styles such items are often known as dipped or handdipped incense this form of incense requires the least skill and equipment to manufacture since the blanks are preformed in china or south east asia then simply scented with essential oils incense mixtures can be extruded or pressed into shapes small quantities of water are combined with the fragrance and incense base mixture and kneaded into a hard dough the incense dough is then pressed into shaped forms to create cone and smaller coiled incense or forced through a hydraulic press for solid stick incense the formed incense is then trimmed and slowly dried incense produced in this fashion has a tendency to warp or become misshapen when improperly dried and as such must be placed in climatecontrolled rooms and rotated several times through the drying process traditionally the bamboo core of cored stick incense is prepared by hand from phyllostachys heterocycla cv pubescens since this species produces thick wood and easily burns to ashes in the incense stick through this process known as splitting the foot of the incense stick the bamboo is trimmed to length soaked peeled and then continuously split in halves until thin sticks of bamboo with square cross sections of less than mm  this process has been largely been replaced by machines in modern incense production in the case of cored incensed sticks several methods are employed to coat the sticks cores with incense mixture paste rolling a wet malleable paste of incense mixture is first rolled into a long thin coil using a paddle then a thin stick is put next to the coil and the stick and paste are rolled together until the stick is centered in the mixture and the desired thickness is achieved the stick is then cut to the desired length and dried powdercoating powdercoating is used mainly to produce cored incense of either larger coil up to  meter in diameter or cored stick forms a bundle of the supporting material typically thin bamboo or sandalwood slivers is soaked in water or a thin waterglue mixture for a short time the thin sticks are then evenly separated then dipped into a tray of incense powder consisting of fragrance materials and occasionally a plantbased binder the dry incense powder is then tossed and piled over the stick while they are spread apart the sticks are then gently rolled and packed to maintain roundness while more incense powder is repeatedly tossed onto the sticks three to four layers of powder are coated onto the sticks forming a  mm thick layer of incense material on the stick the coated incense is then allowed to dry in open air additional coatings of incense mixture can be applied after each period of successive drying incense sticks that are burned in temples of chinese folk religion produced in this fashion can have a thickness between  and  millimeters compression a damp powder is mechanically formed around a cored stick by compression similar to the way uncored sticks are formed this form is becoming more commonly found due to the higher labor cost of producing powdercoated or pasterolled sticks joss sticksedit joss sticks in the temple of literature hanoi in hanoi vietnam joss sticks are the name

is the giant botafumeiro thurible which swings from the ceiling of the cathedral of santiago de compostela it is used in part to mask the scent of the many tired unwashed pilgrims huddled together in the cathedral of santiago de compostela a similar utilitarian use of incense can be found in the postreformation church of england although the ceremonial use of incense was abandoned until the oxford

service in a vessel called a perfuming pan in iconography of the day this vessel is shown to be elongated and flat with a single long handle on one side it is important to note that the perfuming pan was used instead of the thurible as the latter would have likely offended the protestant sensibilities of the th and th centuries the regular burning of direct combustion incense has been used for

smokeless sandalwood research carried out in taiwan in  linked the burning of incense sticks to the slow accumulation of potential carcinogens in a poorly ventilated environment by measuring the levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including benzopyrene within buddhist temples the study found gaseous aliphatic aldehydes which are carcinogenic and mutagenic in incense smoke a survey of risk factors for lung cancer also conducted in taiwan noted an inverse association between incense burning and adenocarcinoma of the lung though the finding was not deemed significant in contrast a study by several asian cancer research centersclarify showed no association was found between exposure to incense burning and respiratory symptoms like chronic cough chronic sputum chronic bronchitis runny nose wheezing asthma allergic rhinitis or pneumonia among the three populations studied ie primary school children their nonsmoking mothers or a group of older nonsmoking female controls incense burning did not affect lung cancer risk among nonsmokers but it significantly reduced risk among smokers even after adjusting for lifetime smoking amount however the researchers qualified the findings by noting that incense burning in the studied population was associated with certain lowcancerrisk dietary habits and concluded that diet can be a significant confounder of epidemiological studies on air pollution and respiratory health although several studies have not shown a link between incense and cancer of the lung many other types of cancer have been directly linked to burning incensespecify a study published in  in the medical journal cancer found that incense use is associated with a statistically significant higher risk of cancers of the upper respiratory tract with the exception of nasopharyngeal cancer those who used incense heavily also had higher rates of a type of cancer called squamouscell carcinoma which refers to tumors that arise in the cells lining the internal and external surfaces of the body the link between incense use and increased cancer risk held when the researchers weighed other factors including cigarette smoking diet and drinking habits the research team noted that this association is consistent with a large number of studies identifying carcinogens in incense smoke and given the widespread and sometimes involuntary exposure to smoke from burning incense these findings carry significant public health implications in  the south china university of technology found toxicity of incense to chinese hamsters ovary cells to be even

products of human habitation but was widely perceived to also deter malevolent demons and appease the gods with its pleasant aroma resin balls were found in many prehistoric egyptian tombs in el mahasna furnishing tangible archaeological substantiation to the prominence of incense and related compounds within egyptian antiquity one of the oldest extant incense burners originates from the th dynasty the temple of deirelbahari in egypt contains a series of carvings that depict an expedition for incense the babylonians used incense while offering prayers to divining  oracles incense spread from there to greece and rome incense burners have been found in the indus civilization – bce evidence suggests oils were used mainly for their aroma india also adopted techniques from east asia adapting the inherited formulation to encompass aromatic roots and other indigenous flora this comprised the initial usage of subterranean plant parts within the fabrication of incense new herbs like sarsaparilla seeds frankincense and cypress were used by indians for incense at around  bce ancient china began the use of incense in the religious sense namely for worship incense was used by chinese cultures from neolithic times and became more widespread in the xia shang and zhou dynasties the earliest documented instance of incense utilization comes from the ancient chinese who employed incense composed of herbs and plant products such as cassia cinnamon styrax sandalwood amongst others as a component of numerous formalized ceremonial rites incense usage reached its peak during the song dynasty with numerous buildings erected specifically for incense ceremonies brought to japan in the th century by korean buddhist monks who used the mystical aromas in their purification rites the delicate scents of koh highquality japanese incense became a source of amusement and entertainment with nobles in the imperial court during the heian era  years later during the th century shogunate a

and white indian sandalwood powder santalum album a variety of materials have been used in making incense historically there has been a preference for using locally available ingredients for example sage and cedar were used by the indigenous peoples of north america trading in incense materials comprised a major part of commerce along the silk road and other trade routes one notably called the incense route the same could be said for the techniques used to make incense local knowledge and tools were extremely influential on the style but methods were also influenced by migrations of foreigners among them clergy and physicians who were both familiar with incense arts combustible baseedit a räucherkerzchen  a charcoalbased incense cone the combustible base of a direct burning incense mixture not only binds the fragrant material together but also allows the produced incense to burn with a selfsustained ember which propagates slowly and evenly through an entire piece of incense with such regularity that it can be used to mark timecitation needed the base is chosen such that it does not produce a perceptible smell commercially two types of incense base predominate fuel and oxidizer mixtures charcoal or wood powder forms the fuel for the combustion gums such as gum arabic or gum tragacanth are used to bind the mixture together while an oxidizer such as sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate sustains the burning of the incense fragrant materials are combined into the base prior to formation as in the case of powdered incense materials or after formation as in the case of essential oils the formula for the charcoalbased incense is superficially similar to black powder though it lacks the sulfur natural plantbased binders mucilaginous material which can be derived from many botanical sources is mixed with fragrant materials and water the mucilage from the wet binding powder holds the fragrant material together while the cellulose in the powder combusts to form a stable ember when lit the dry binding powder usually comprises about  of the dry weight in the finished incense this includes makko incense powder made from the bark of various trees from the persea such as persea thunbergii xiangnan pi made from the bark of phoebe genus trees such as phoebe nanmu persea zuihoensis jigit a resin based binder used in india laha or dar bark based powders used in nepal tibet and other east asian countries typesedit incense materials are available in various forms and degrees of processing they can generally be separated into directburning and indirectburning types depending on use preference for one form or another varies with culture tradition and personal taste although the production of direct and indirectburning incense are both blended to produce a pleasant smell when burned the two differ in their composition due to the formers requirement for even stable and sustained burning indirectburningedit indirectburning incense also called noncombustible incensebetter source needed is a combination of aromatic ingredients that are not prepared in any particular way or encouraged into any particular form leaving it mostly unsuitable for direct combustion the use of this class of incense requires a separate heat source since it does not generally kindle a fire capable of burning itself and may not ignite at all under normal conditions this incense can vary in the duration of its burning with the texture of the material finer ingredients tend to burn more rapidly while coarsely ground or whole chunks may be consumed very gradually as they have less total surface area the heat is traditionally provided by charcoal or glowing embers in the west the best known incense materials of this type are frankincense

mixing it with essential oils floral fragrances are the most common but citrus such as lemon is not uncommon the incense mixture is then rolled out into a slab approximately  cm thick and left until the slab has firmed it is then cut into small cubes coated with clay powder to prevent adhesion and allowed to fully harden and dry in greece this rolled incense resin is called moskolibano and generally comes in either a pink or green colour denoting the fragrance with pink being rose and green being jasmine direct burningedit some incense sticks are uneven in thickness in order to obtain desired combustion qualities attention has to be paid to certain proportions in direct burning incense mixtures oil content resinous materials such as myrrh and frankincense must not exceed the amount of dry materials in the mixture to such a degree that the incense will not smolder and burncitation needed the higher the oil content relative to the dry mass the less likely the mixture is to burn effectivelycitation needed typically the resinous or oily substances are balanced with dry materials such as wood bark and leaf powders oxidizer quantity the amount of chemical oxidizer in gumbound incense must be carefully proportioned if too little the incense will not ignite and if too much the incense will burn too quickly and not produce fragrant smokecitation needed mixture density incense mixtures made with natural binders must not be combined with too much water in mixing or overcompressed while being formed which would result in either uneven air distribution or undesirable density in the mixture causing the incense to burn unevenly too slowly or too quicklycitation needed particulate size the incense mixture has to be well pulverized with similarly sized particulates uneven and large particulates result in uneven burning and inconsistent aroma production when burnedcitation needed binder watersoluble binders such as makko have to be used in the right proportion to ensure that the incense mixture does not crumble when dry but also that the binder does not take up too much of the mixture some kinds of directburning incense are created from incense blanks made of unscented combustible dust immersed into any suitable kind of essential or fragrance oil these are often sold in america by fleamarket and sidewalk vendors who have developed their own styles such items are often known as dipped or handdipped incense this form of incense requires the least skill and equipment to manufacture since the blanks are preformed in china or south east asia then simply scented with essential oils incense mixtures can be extruded or pressed into shapes small quantities of water are combined with the fragrance and incense base mixture and kneaded into a hard dough the incense dough is then pressed into shaped forms to create cone and smaller coiled incense or forced through a hydraulic press for solid stick incense the formed incense is then trimmed and slowly dried incense produced in this fashion has a tendency to warp or become misshapen when improperly dried and as such must be placed in climatecontrolled rooms and rotated several times through the drying process traditionally the bamboo core of cored stick incense is prepared by hand from phyllostachys heterocycla cv pubescens since this species produces thick wood and easily burns to ashes in the incense stick through this process known as splitting the foot of the incense stick the bamboo is trimmed to length soaked peeled and then continuously split in halves until thin sticks of bamboo with square cross sections of less than mm  this process has been largely been replaced by machines in modern incense production in the case of cored incensed sticks several methods are employed to coat the sticks cores with incense mixture paste rolling a wet malleable paste of incense mixture is first rolled into a long thin coil using a paddle then a thin stick is put next to the coil and the stick and paste are rolled together until the stick is centered in the mixture and the desired thickness is achieved the stick is then cut to the desired length and dried powdercoating powdercoating is used mainly to produce cored incense of either larger coil up to  meter in diameter or cored stick forms a bundle of the supporting material typically thin bamboo or sandalwood slivers is soaked in water or a thin waterglue mixture for a short time the thin sticks are then evenly separated then dipped into a tray of incense powder consisting of fragrance materials and occasionally a plantbased binder the dry incense powder is then tossed and piled over the stick while they are spread apart the sticks are then gently rolled and packed to maintain roundness while more incense powder is repeatedly tossed onto the sticks three to four layers of powder are coated onto the sticks forming a  mm thick layer of incense material on the stick the coated incense is then allowed to dry in open air additional coatings of incense mixture can be applied after each period of successive drying incense sticks that are burned in temples of chinese folk religion produced in this fashion can have a thickness between  and  millimeters compression a damp powder is mechanically formed around a cored stick by compression similar to the way uncored sticks are formed this form is becoming more commonly found due to the higher labor cost of producing powdercoated or pasterolled sticks joss sticksedit joss sticks in the temple of literature hanoi in hanoi vietnam joss sticks are the name

other less desirable odours this utility led to the use of incense in funerary ceremonies because the incense could smother the scent of decay another example of this use as well as of religious use is the giant botafumeiro thurible which swings from the ceiling of the cathedral of santiago de compostela it is used in part to mask the scent of the many tired unwashed pilgrims huddled together in the cathedral of santiago de compostela a similar utilitarian use of incense can be found in the postreformation church of england although the ceremonial use of incense was abandoned until the oxford movement it was common to have incense typically frankincense burned before grand occasions when the church would be crowded the frankincense was carried about by a member of the vestry before the service in a vessel called a perfuming pan in iconography of the day this vessel is shown to be elongated and flat with a single long handle on one side it is important to note that the perfuming pan was used instead of the thurible as the latter would have likely offended the protestant sensibilities of the th and th centuries the regular burning of direct combustion incense has been used for

smokeless sandalwood research carried out in taiwan in  linked the burning of incense sticks to the slow accumulation of potential carcinogens in a poorly ventilated environment by measuring the levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including benzopyrene within buddhist temples the study found gaseous aliphatic aldehydes which are carcinogenic and mutagenic in incense smoke a survey of risk factors for lung cancer also conducted in taiwan noted an inverse association between incense burning and adenocarcinoma of the lung though the finding was not deemed significant in contrast a study by several asian cancer research centersclarify showed no association was found between exposure to incense burning and respiratory symptoms like chronic cough chronic sputum chronic bronchitis runny nose wheezing asthma allergic rhinitis or pneumonia among the three populations studied ie primary school children their nonsmoking mothers or a group of older nonsmoking female controls incense burning did not affect lung cancer risk among nonsmokers but it significantly reduced risk among smokers even after adjusting for lifetime smoking amount however the researchers qualified the findings by noting that incense burning in the studied population was associated with certain lowcancerrisk dietary habits and concluded that diet can be a significant confounder of epidemiological studies on air pollution and respiratory health although several studies have not shown a link between incense and cancer of the lung many other types of cancer have been directly linked to burning incensespecify a study published in  in the medical journal cancer found that incense use is associated with a statistically significant higher risk of cancers of the upper respiratory tract with the exception of nasopharyngeal cancer those who used incense heavily also had higher rates of a type of cancer called squamouscell carcinoma which refers to tumors that arise in the cells lining the internal and external surfaces of the body the link between incense use and increased cancer risk held when the researchers weighed other factors including cigarette smoking diet and drinking habits

from burning incense these findings carry significant public health implications in  the south china university of technology found toxicity of incense to chinese hamsters ovary cells to be even

and white indian sandalwood powder santalum album a variety of materials have been used in making incense historically there has been a preference for using locally available ingredients for example sage and cedar were used by the indigenous peoples of north america trading in incense materials comprised a major part of commerce along the silk road and other trade routes one notably called the incense route the same could be said for the techniques used to make incense local knowledge and tools were extremely influential on the style but methods were also influenced by migrations of foreigners among them clergy and physicians who were both familiar with incense arts combustible baseedit a räucherkerzchen  a charcoalbased incense cone the combustible base of a direct burning incense mixture not only binds the fragrant material together but also allows the produced incense to burn with a selfsustained ember which propagates slowly and evenly through an entire piece of incense with such regularity that it can be used to mark timecitation needed the base is chosen such that it does not produce a perceptible smell commercially two types of incense base predominate fuel and oxidizer mixtures charcoal or wood powder forms the fuel for the combustion gums such as gum arabic or gum tragacanth are used to bind the mixture together while an oxidizer such as sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate sustains the burning of the incense fragrant materials are combined into the base prior to formation as in the case of powdered incense materials or after formation as in the case of essential oils the formula for the charcoalbased incense is superficially similar to black powder though it lacks the sulfur natural plantbased binders mucilaginous material which can be derived from many botanical sources is mixed with fragrant materials and water the mucilage from the wet binding powder holds the fragrant material together while the cellulose in the powder combusts to form a stable ember when lit the dry binding powder usually comprises about  of the dry weight in the finished incense this includes makko incense powder made from the bark of various trees from the persea such as persea thunbergii xiangnan pi made from the bark of phoebe genus trees such as phoebe nanmu persea zuihoensis jigit a resin based binder used in india laha or dar bark based powders used in nepal tibet and other east asian countries typesedit incense materials are available in various forms and degrees of processing they can generally be separated into directburning and indirectburning types depending on use preference for one form or another varies with culture tradition and personal taste although the production of direct and indirectburning incense are both blended to produce a pleasant smell when burned the two differ in their composition due to the formers requirement for even stable and sustained burning indirectburningedit indirectburning incense also called noncombustible incensebetter source needed is a combination of aromatic ingredients that are not prepared in any particular way or encouraged into any particular form leaving it mostly unsuitable for direct combustion the use of this class of incense requires a separate heat source since it does not generally kindle a fire capable of burning itself and may not ignite at all under normal conditions this incense can vary in the duration of its burning with the texture of the material finer ingredients tend to burn more rapidly while coarsely ground or whole chunks may be consumed very gradually as they have less total surface area the heat is traditionally provided by charcoal or glowing embers in the west the best known incense materials of this type are frankincense and myrrh likely due to their numerous mentions in the christian bible in fact the word for frankincense in many european languages also alludes to any form of incense whole the incense material is burned directly in its raw unprocessed form on top of coal embers powdered or granulated the incense material is broken down into finer bits this incense burns quickly and provides a short period of intense smells paste the powdered or granulated incense material is mixed with a sticky and incombustible binder such as dried fruit honey or a soft resin and then formed to balls or small pastilles these may then be allowed to mature in a controlled environment where the fragrances can commingle and unite much arabian incense also called bukhoor or bakhoor is of this type bakhoor actually refers to frankincense in arabic and japan has a history of kneaded incense called nerikō or awasekō using this method within the eastern orthodox christian tradition raw frankincense is ground into a fine powder and then mixed with various sweetsmelling essential oils directburningedit incense coils hanging from the ceiling of an east asian temple directburning incense also called combustible incensebetter source needed is lit directly by a flame the glowing ember on the incense will continue to smoulder and burn away the rest of the incense without continued application of heat or flame from an outside source directburning incense is either extruded pressed into forms or coated onto a supporting material this class of incense is made from a moldable substrate of fragrant finely ground or liquid incense materials and odourless binder the composition must be adjusted to provide fragrance in the proper concentration and to ensure even burning the following types of directburning incense are commonly encountered though the material itself can take virtually any form according to expediency or whimsy burning incense stick and its smoke coil extruded and shaped into a coil without a core this type of incense is able to burn for an extended period from hours to days and is commonly produced and used by chinese culture cone incense in this form burns relatively fast incense cones were invented in japan in the s cored stick this form of stick incense has a supporting core of bamboo higher quality varieties of this form have fragrant sandalwood cores the core is coated by a thick layer of incense material that burns away with the core this type of incense is commonly produced in india and china when used for worship in chinese folk religion cored incensed sticks are sometimes known as joss sticks solid stick this stick incense has no supporting core and is completely made of incense material easily broken into pieces it allows one to determine the specific amount of incense they wish to burn this is the most commonly produced form of incense in japan and tibet powder the loose incense powder used for making indirect burning incense is sometimes burned without further processing they are typically packed into long trails on top of wood ash using a stencil and burned in special censers or incense clocks paper paper infused with incense folded accordion style lit and blown out examples are carta darmenia and papier darménie rope the incense powder is rolled into paper sheets which are then rolled into ropes twisted tightly then doubled over and twisted again yielding a twostrand rope the larger end is the bight and may be stood vertically in a shallow dish of sand or pebbles the smaller pointed end is lit this

form of incense that uses no heat it comes in three parts a bottlecontainer scented essential incense oil and bamboo reeds the incense oil is placed into the container and bamboo reeds are then put into the same container this is done to absorb some of the incense oil as well as to help carry its scent and essence out of the container and into the surrounding air reeds typically have tiny tube

mixing it with essential oils floral fragrances are the most common but citrus such as lemon is not uncommon the incense mixture is then rolled out into a slab approximately  cm thick and left until the slab has firmed it is then cut into small cubes coated with clay powder to prevent adhesion and allowed to fully harden and dry in greece this rolled incense resin is called moskolibano and generally comes in either a pink or green colour denoting the fragrance with pink being rose and green being jasmine direct burningedit some incense sticks are uneven in thickness in order to obtain desired combustion qualities attention has to be paid to certain proportions in direct burning incense mixtures oil content resinous materials such as myrrh and frankincense must not exceed the amount of dry materials in the mixture to such a degree that the incense will not smolder and burncitation needed the higher the oil content relative to the dry mass the less likely the mixture is to burn effectivelycitation needed typically the resinous or oily substances are balanced with dry materials such as wood bark and leaf powders oxidizer quantity the amount of chemical oxidizer in gumbound incense must be carefully proportioned if too little the incense will not ignite and if too much the incense will burn too quickly and not produce fragrant smokecitation needed mixture density incense mixtures made with natural binders must not be combined with too much water in mixing or overcompressed while being formed which would result in either uneven air distribution or undesirable density in the mixture causing the incense to burn unevenly too slowly or too quicklycitation needed particulate size the incense mixture has to be well pulverized with similarly sized particulates uneven and large particulates result in uneven burning and inconsistent aroma production when burnedcitation needed binder watersoluble binders such as makko have to be used in the right proportion to ensure that the incense mixture does not crumble when dry but also that the binder does not take up too much of the mixture some kinds of directburning incense are created from incense blanks made of unscented combustible dust immersed into any suitable kind of essential or fragrance oil these are often sold in america by fleamarket and sidewalk vendors who have developed their own styles such items are often known as dipped or handdipped incense this form of incense requires the least skill and equipment to manufacture since the blanks are preformed in china or south east asia then simply scented with essential oils incense mixtures can be extruded or pressed into shapes small quantities of water are combined with the fragrance and incense base mixture and kneaded into a hard dough the incense dough is then pressed into shaped forms to create cone and smaller coiled incense or forced through a hydraulic press for solid stick incense the formed incense is then trimmed and slowly dried incense produced in this fashion has a tendency to warp or become misshapen when improperly dried and as such must be placed in climatecontrolled rooms and rotated several times through the drying process traditionally the bamboo core of cored stick incense is prepared by hand from phyllostachys heterocycla cv pubescens since this species produces thick wood and easily burns to ashes in the incense stick through this process known as splitting the foot of the incense stick the bamboo is trimmed to length soaked peeled and then continuously split in halves until thin sticks of bamboo with square cross sections of less than mm  this process has been largely been replaced by machines in modern incense production in the case of cored incensed sticks several methods are employed to coat the sticks cores with incense mixture paste rolling a wet malleable paste of incense mixture is first rolled into a long thin coil using a paddle then a thin stick is put next to the coil and the stick and paste are rolled together until the stick is centered in the mixture and the desired thickness is achieved the stick is then cut to the desired length and dried powdercoating powdercoating is used mainly to produce cored incense of either larger coil up to  meter in diameter or cored stick forms a bundle of the supporting material typically thin bamboo or sandalwood slivers is soaked in water or a thin waterglue mixture for a short time the thin sticks are then evenly separated then dipped into a tray of incense powder consisting of fragrance materials and occasionally a plantbased binder the dry incense powder is then tossed and piled over the stick while they are spread apart the sticks are then gently rolled and packed to maintain roundness while more incense powder is repeatedly tossed onto the sticks three to four layers of powder are coated onto the sticks forming a  mm thick layer of incense material on the stick the coated incense is then allowed to dry in open air additional coatings of incense mixture can be applied after each period of successive drying incense sticks that are burned in temples of chinese folk religion produced in this fashion can have a thickness between  and  millimeters compression a damp powder is mechanically formed around a cored stick by compression similar to the way uncored sticks are formed this form is becoming more commonly found due to the higher labor cost of producing powdercoated or pasterolled sticks joss sticksedit joss sticks in the temple of literature hanoi in hanoi vietnam joss sticks are the name

is the giant botafumeiro thurible which swings from the ceiling of the cathedral of santiago de compostela it is used in part to mask the scent of the many tired unwashed pilgrims huddled together in the cathedral of santiago de compostela a similar utilitarian use of incense can be found in the postreformation church of england although the ceremonial use of incense was abandoned until the oxford

smokeless sandalwood research carried out in taiwan in  linked the burning of incense sticks to the slow accumulation of potential carcinogens in a poorly ventilated environment by measuring the levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including benzopyrene within buddhist temples the study found gaseous aliphatic aldehydes which are carcinogenic and mutagenic in incense smoke a survey of risk factors for lung cancer also conducted in taiwan noted an inverse association between incense burning and adenocarcinoma of the lung though the finding was not deemed significant in contrast a study by several asian cancer research centersclarify showed no association was found between exposure to incense burning and respiratory symptoms like chronic cough chronic sputum chronic bronchitis runny nose wheezing asthma allergic rhinitis or pneumonia among the three populations studied ie primary school children their nonsmoking mothers or a group of older nonsmoking female controls incense burning did not affect lung cancer risk among nonsmokers but it significantly reduced risk among smokers even after adjusting for lifetime smoking amount however the researchers qualified the findings by noting that incense burning in the studied population was associated with certain lowcancerrisk dietary habits and concluded that diet can be a significant confounder of epidemiological studies on air pollution and respiratory health although several studies have not shown a link between incense and cancer of the lung many other types of cancer have been directly linked to burning incensespecify a study published in  in the medical journal cancer found that incense use is associated with a statistically significant higher risk of cancers of the upper respiratory tract with the exception of nasopharyngeal cancer those who used incense heavily also had higher rates of a type of cancer called squamouscell carcinoma which refers to tumors that arise in the cells lining the internal and external surfaces of the body the link between incense use and increased cancer risk held when the researchers weighed other factors including cigarette smoking diet and drinking habits the research team noted that this association is consistent with a large number of studies identifying carcinogens in incense smoke and given the widespread and sometimes involuntary exposure to smoke from burning incense these findings carry significant public health implications in  the south china university of technology found toxicity of incense to chinese hamsters ovary cells to be even

mahasna furnishing tangible archaeological substantiation to the prominence of incense and related compounds within egyptian antiquity one of the oldest extant incense burners originates from the th dynasty the temple of deirelbahari in egypt contains a series of carvings that depict an expedition for incense the babylonians used incense while offering prayers to divining  oracles incense spread from there to greece and rome incense burners have been found in the indus civilization – bce evidence suggests oils were used mainly for their aroma india also adopted techniques from east asia adapting the inherited formulation to encompass aromatic roots and other indigenous flora this comprised the initial usage of subterranean plant parts within the fabrication of incense new herbs like sarsaparilla seeds frankincense and cypress were used by indians for incense at around  bce ancient china began the use of incense in the religious sense namely for worship incense was used by chinese cultures from neolithic times and became more widespread in the xia shang and zhou dynasties the earliest documented instance of incense utilization comes from the ancient chinese who employed incense composed of herbs and plant products such as cassia cinnamon styrax sandalwood amongst others as a component of numerous formalized ceremonial rites incense usage reached its peak during the song

and white indian sandalwood powder santalum album a variety of materials have been used in making incense historically there has been a preference for using locally available ingredients for example sage and cedar were used by the indigenous peoples of north america trading in incense materials comprised a major part of commerce along the silk road and other trade routes one notably called the incense route the same could be said for the techniques used to make incense local knowledge and tools were extremely influential on the style but methods were also influenced by migrations of foreigners among them clergy and physicians who were both familiar with incense arts combustible baseedit a räucherkerzchen  a charcoalbased incense cone the combustible base of a direct burning incense mixture not only binds the fragrant material together but also allows the produced incense to burn with a selfsustained ember which propagates slowly and evenly through an entire piece of incense with such regularity that it can be used to mark timecitation needed the base is chosen such that it does not produce a perceptible smell commercially two types of incense base predominate fuel and oxidizer mixtures charcoal or wood powder forms the fuel for the combustion gums such as gum arabic or gum tragacanth are used to bind the mixture together while an oxidizer such as sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate sustains the burning of the incense fragrant materials are combined into the base prior to formation as in the case of powdered incense materials or after formation as in the case of essential oils the formula for the charcoalbased incense is superficially similar to black powder though it lacks the sulfur natural plantbased binders mucilaginous material which can be derived from many botanical sources is mixed with fragrant materials and water the mucilage from the wet binding powder holds the fragrant material together while the cellulose in the powder combusts to form a stable ember when lit the dry binding powder usually comprises about  of the dry weight in the finished incense this includes makko incense powder made from the bark of various trees from the persea such as persea thunbergii xiangnan pi made from the bark of phoebe genus trees such as phoebe nanmu persea zuihoensis jigit a resin based binder used in india laha or dar bark based powders used in nepal tibet and other east asian countries typesedit incense materials are available in various forms and degrees of processing they can generally be separated into directburning and indirectburning types depending on use preference for one form or another varies with culture tradition and personal taste although the production of direct and indirectburning incense are both blended to produce a pleasant smell when burned the two differ in their composition due to the formers requirement for even stable and sustained burning indirectburningedit indirectburning incense also called noncombustible incensebetter source needed is a combination of aromatic ingredients that are not prepared in any particular way or encouraged into any particular form leaving it mostly unsuitable for direct combustion the use of this class of incense requires a separate heat source since it does not generally kindle a fire capable of burning itself and may not ignite at all under normal conditions this incense can vary in the duration of its burning with the texture of the material finer ingredients tend to burn more rapidly while coarsely ground or whole chunks may be consumed very gradually as they have less total surface area the heat is traditionally provided by charcoal or glowing embers in the west the best known incense materials of this type are frankincense and myrrh likely due to their numerous mentions in the christian bible in fact the word for frankincense in many european languages also alludes to any form of incense whole the incense material is burned directly in its raw unprocessed form on top of coal embers powdered or granulated the incense material is broken down into finer bits this incense burns quickly and provides a short period of intense smells paste the powdered or granulated incense material is mixed with a sticky and incombustible binder such as dried fruit honey or a soft resin and then formed to balls or small pastilles these may then be allowed to mature in a controlled environment where the fragrances can commingle and unite much arabian incense also called bukhoor or bakhoor is of this type bakhoor actually refers to frankincense in arabic and japan has a history of kneaded incense called nerikō or awasekō using this method within the eastern orthodox christian tradition raw frankincense is ground into a fine powder and then mixed with various sweetsmelling essential oils directburningedit incense coils hanging from the ceiling of an east asian temple directburning incense also called combustible incensebetter source needed is lit directly by a flame the glowing ember on the incense will continue to smoulder and burn away the rest of the incense without continued application of heat or flame from an outside source directburning incense is either extruded pressed into forms or coated onto a supporting material this class of incense is made from a moldable substrate of fragrant finely ground or liquid incense materials and odourless binder the composition must be adjusted to provide fragrance in the proper concentration and to ensure even burning the following types of directburning incense are commonly encountered though the material itself can take virtually any form according to expediency or whimsy burning incense stick and its smoke coil extruded and shaped into a coil without a core this type of incense is able to burn for an extended period from hours to days and is commonly produced and used by chinese culture cone incense in this form burns relatively fast incense cones were invented in japan in the s cored stick this form of stick incense has a supporting core of bamboo higher quality varieties of this form have fragrant sandalwood cores the core is coated by a thick layer of incense material that burns away with the core this type of incense is commonly produced in india and china when used for worship in chinese folk religion cored incensed sticks are sometimes known as joss sticks solid stick this stick incense has no supporting core and is completely made of incense material easily broken into pieces it allows one to determine the specific amount of incense they wish to burn this is the most commonly produced form of incense in japan and tibet powder the loose incense powder used for making indirect burning incense is sometimes burned without further processing they are typically packed into long trails on top of wood ash using a stencil and burned in special censers or incense clocks paper paper infused with incense folded accordion style lit and blown out examples are carta darmenia and papier darménie rope the incense powder is rolled into paper sheets which are then rolled into ropes twisted tightly then doubled over and twisted again yielding a twostrand rope the larger end is the bight and may be stood vertically in a shallow dish of sand or pebbles the smaller pointed end is lit this

form of incense that uses no heat it comes in three parts a bottlecontainer scented essential incense oil and bamboo reeds the incense oil is placed into the container and bamboo reeds are then put into the same container this is done to absorb some of the incense oil as well as to help carry its scent and essence out of the container and into the surrounding air reeds typically have tiny tube

mixing it with essential oils floral fragrances are the most common but citrus such as lemon is not uncommon the incense mixture is then rolled out into a slab approximately  cm thick and left until the slab has firmed it is then cut into small cubes coated with clay powder to prevent adhesion and allowed to fully harden and dry in greece this rolled incense resin is called moskolibano and generally comes in either a pink or green colour denoting the fragrance with pink being rose and green being jasmine direct burningedit some incense sticks are uneven in thickness in order to obtain desired combustion qualities attention has to be paid to certain proportions in direct burning incense mixtures oil content resinous materials such as myrrh and frankincense must not exceed the amount of dry materials in the mixture to such a degree that the incense will not smolder and burncitation needed the higher the oil content relative to the dry mass the less likely the mixture is to burn effectivelycitation needed typically the resinous or oily substances are balanced with dry materials such as wood bark and leaf powders oxidizer quantity the amount of chemical oxidizer in gumbound incense must be carefully proportioned if too little the incense will not ignite and if too much the incense will burn too quickly and not produce fragrant smokecitation needed mixture density incense mixtures made with natural binders must not be combined with too much water in mixing or overcompressed while being formed which would result in either uneven air distribution or undesirable density in the mixture causing the incense to burn unevenly too slowly or too quicklycitation needed particulate size the incense mixture has to be well pulverized with similarly sized particulates uneven and large particulates result in uneven burning and inconsistent aroma production when burnedcitation needed binder watersoluble binders such as makko have to be used in the right proportion to ensure that the incense mixture does not crumble when dry but also that the binder does not take up too much of the mixture some kinds of directburning incense are created from incense blanks made of unscented combustible dust immersed into any suitable kind of essential or fragrance oil these are often sold in america by fleamarket and sidewalk vendors who have developed their own styles such items are often known as dipped or handdipped incense this form of incense requires the least skill and equipment to manufacture since the blanks are preformed in china or south east asia then simply scented with essential oils incense mixtures can be extruded or pressed into shapes small quantities of water are combined with the fragrance and incense base mixture and kneaded into a hard dough the incense dough is then pressed into shaped forms to create cone and smaller coiled incense or forced through a hydraulic press for solid stick incense the formed incense is then trimmed and slowly dried incense produced in this fashion has a tendency to warp or become misshapen when improperly dried and as such must be placed in climatecontrolled rooms and rotated several times through the drying process traditionally the bamboo core of cored stick incense is prepared by hand from phyllostachys heterocycla cv pubescens since this species produces thick wood and easily burns to ashes in the incense stick through this process known as splitting the foot of the incense stick the bamboo is trimmed to length soaked peeled and then continuously split in halves until thin sticks of bamboo with square cross sections of less than mm  this process has been largely been replaced by machines in modern incense production in the case of cored incensed sticks several methods are employed to coat the sticks cores with incense mixture paste rolling a wet malleable paste of incense mixture is first rolled into a long thin coil using a paddle then a thin stick is put next to the coil and the stick and paste are rolled together until the stick is centered in the mixture and the desired thickness is achieved the stick is then cut to the desired length and dried powdercoating powdercoating is used mainly to produce cored incense of either larger coil up to  meter in diameter or cored stick forms a bundle of the supporting material typically thin bamboo or sandalwood slivers is soaked in water or a thin waterglue mixture for a short time the thin sticks are then evenly separated then dipped into a tray of incense powder consisting of fragrance materials and occasionally a plantbased binder the dry incense powder is then tossed and piled over the stick while they are spread apart the sticks are then gently rolled and packed to maintain roundness while more incense powder is repeatedly tossed onto the sticks three to four layers of powder are coated onto the sticks forming a  mm thick layer of incense material on the stick the coated incense is then allowed to dry in open air additional coatings of incense mixture can be applied after each period of successive drying incense sticks that are burned in temples of chinese folk religion produced in this fashion can have a thickness between  and  millimeters compression a damp powder is mechanically formed around a cored stick by compression similar to the way uncored sticks are formed this form is becoming more commonly found due to the higher labor cost of producing powdercoated or pasterolled sticks joss sticksedit joss sticks in the temple of literature hanoi in hanoi vietnam joss sticks are the name

other less desirable odours this utility led to the use of incense in funerary ceremonies because the incense could smother the scent of decay another example of this use as well as of religious use is the giant botafumeiro thurible which swings from the ceiling of the cathedral of santiago de compostela it is used in part to mask the scent of the many tired unwashed pilgrims huddled together in the cathedral of santiago de compostela a similar utilitarian use of incense can be found in the postreformation church of england although the ceremonial use of incense was abandoned until the oxford movement it was common to have incense typically frankincense burned before grand occasions when the church would be crowded the frankincense was carried about by a member of the vestry before the service in a vessel called a perfuming pan in iconography of the day this vessel is shown to be elongated and flat with a single long handle on one side it is important to note that the perfuming pan was used instead of the thurible as the latter would have likely offended the protestant sensibilities of the th and th centuries the regular burning of direct combustion incense has been used for

smokeless sandalwood research carried out in taiwan in  linked the burning of incense sticks to the slow accumulation of potential carcinogens in a poorly ventilated environment by measuring the levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons including benzopyrene within buddhist temples the study found gaseous aliphatic aldehydes which are carcinogenic and mutagenic in incense smoke a survey of risk factors for lung cancer also conducted in taiwan noted an inverse association between incense burning and adenocarcinoma of the lung though the finding was not deemed significant in contrast a study by several asian cancer research centersclarify showed no association was found between exposure to incense burning and respiratory symptoms like chronic cough chronic sputum chronic bronchitis runny nose wheezing asthma allergic rhinitis or pneumonia among the three populations studied ie primary school children their nonsmoking mothers or a group of older nonsmoking female controls incense burning did not affect lung cancer risk among nonsmokers but it significantly reduced risk among smokers even after adjusting for lifetime smoking amount however the researchers qualified the findings by noting that incense burning in the studied population was associated with certain lowcancerrisk dietary habits and concluded that diet can be a significant confounder of epidemiological studies on air pollution and respiratory health although several studies have not shown a link between incense and cancer of the lung many other types of cancer have been directly linked to burning incensespecify a study published in  in the medical journal cancer found that incense use is associated with a statistically significant higher risk of cancers of the upper respiratory tract with the exception of nasopharyngeal cancer those who used incense heavily also had higher rates of a type of cancer called squamouscell carcinoma which refers to tumors that arise in the cells lining the internal and external surfaces of the body the link between incense use and increased cancer risk held when the researchers weighed other factors including cigarette smoking diet and drinking habits the research team noted that this association is consistent with a large number of studies identifying carcinogens in incense smoke and given the widespread and sometimes involuntary exposure to smoke from burning incense these findings carry significant public health implications in  the south china university of technology found toxicity of incense to chinese hamsters ovary cells to be even
