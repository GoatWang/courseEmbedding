he saw the potential in personal computers he and his partners founded the computer trade show comdex in  they then sold it in  for more than  million in  adelson took the venetians parent company public las vegas sands inc became las vegas sands corp perhaps because of his start in the trade show business adelson focused his hotel efforts on courting the convention and trade show industry at the time when other hotels were focusing on gambling his approach was considered unorthodox the traditional strategy was to keep hotel rooms minimal so as to encourage guests to spend as much time as possible in the casino adelson however had all his hotel rooms made into luxury suites he put in minibars and big screen televisions and he created comfortable work spaces in every room by doing all this he counted on business from the sands expo and convention center to keep midweek occupancy strong this proved correct the company now makes more money in las vegas from conventions than gambling and adelsons conventioncentered approach is no longer considered unorthodox but rather the paradigm in the hospitality industry in las vegas adelson was also among the first to foresee the financial potential of asia before his american competitors he made the move to locate his company nearer to the asian market macau the former portuguese colony turned over to china in late  is the only place

estimated to live within a fivehour flight he realized that his companys future was in creating not one hotel but establishing an entire stripa las vegaslike boulevard in macau featuring many hotels of various styles and price ranges but there were physical challenges to his idea the total area of the small peninsula and two islands that make up macao is less than  square miles this area is densely populated and at the time there was no land for such a large strip so adelson created the land he had his company fill the bay between the coloane and taipa islands he called the area the cotai strip he then began construction of the largest inhabited building in the worldthe venetian macao to ensure the structure was stable  steel piles were driven into the bedrock below at peak times  people were working on the construction site adelson set a threeyear time limit for construction this meant building needed to take place at a rapid pace but the building was finished on time the

largest exhibition centers in asia the resort receives between  and  visitors each day and has a staff of approximately  on site the squarefoot casino is also the largest in the world in  las vegas

that with only one other competitor in singapore opening the resort would prove profitable after it opened at the end of april  it posted a  million operating profit in the first eight months of

to the companys portfolio through its majorityowned subsidiary sands china ltd the company owns several properties in macau including the venetian macao the plaza macao four seasons hotel macao and the four seasonsbranded apartments at the sands cotai central development as well as the sands macao on the macau peninsula the company has opened a room complex at the sands cotai central in  which featured the sheraton st regis holiday inn and conrad hotel brands it is the largest casino company worldwide contents  history  political contributions  properties  past properties  ownership and stock  aircraft  alleged antibribery violations  references  external links historyedit entrepreneur sheldon adelson and his partners dick katzeff irwin chafetz ted cutler and jordan shapiro bought the famous sands hotel in  they opened the sands expo and convention center across from the hotel in  the millionsquarefoot center is currently the largest privately owned convention facility in the world the sands hotel was having trouble competing with the newer resorts on the las vegas strip adelson imploded it to make room for the venetian construction of the venetian began in  when themed hotels were the fashion modeled on venice italy it joined excalibur new yorknew york paris las vegas and other themed hotels on the las vegas strip when the trend in las vegas then shifted to more understated and elegant hotels construction on the palazzo began in  together the palazzo venetian and sands expo make up the world’s largest integrated resort with  allsuite rooms  million square feet of convention and exhibition space and an array of shopping dining and entertainment options adelson got his start through the trade show business as early as the s he saw the potential in personal computers he and his partners founded the computer trade show comdex in  they then sold it in  for more than  million in  adelson took the venetians parent company public las vegas sands inc became las vegas sands corp perhaps because of his start in the trade show business adelson focused his hotel efforts on courting the convention and trade show industry at the time when other hotels were focusing on gambling his approach was considered unorthodox the traditional strategy was to keep hotel rooms minimal so as to encourage guests to spend as much time as possible in the casino adelson however had all his hotel rooms made into luxury suites he put in minibars and big screen televisions and he created comfortable work spaces in every room by doing all this he counted on business from the sands expo and convention center to keep midweek occupancy strong this proved correct the company now makes more money in las vegas from conventions than gambling and adelsons conventioncentered approach is no longer considered unorthodox but rather the paradigm in the hospitality industry in las vegas adelson was also among the first to foresee the financial potential of asia before his american competitors he made the move to locate his company nearer to the asian market macau the former portuguese colony turned over to china in late  is the only place on mainland china where casino gambling is legal las vegas sands opened the sands macao in  adelson next saw that  billion people are within a threehour flight of macau and around  billion people are estimated to live within a fivehour flight he realized that his companys future was in creating not one hotel but establishing an entire stripa las vegaslike boulevard in macau featuring many hotels of various styles and price ranges but there were physical challenges to his idea the total area of the small peninsula and two islands that make up macao is less than  square miles this area is densely populated and at the time there was no land for such a large strip so adelson created the land he had his company fill the bay between the coloane and taipa islands he called the area the cotai strip he then began construction of the largest inhabited building in the worldthe venetian macao to ensure the structure was stable  steel piles were driven into the bedrock below at peak times  people were working on the construction site adelson set a threeyear time limit for construction this meant building needed to take place at a rapid pace but the building was finished on time the hotel officially opened at  pm on august  a time that was believed to have good feng shui the resort is twice the size of its las vegas counterpart with an arena that will seat  people and one of the largest exhibition centers in asia the resort receives between  and  visitors each day and has a staff of approximately  on site the squarefoot casino is also the largest in the world in  las vegas sands opened a four seasons hotel next to the venetian macao as well as paiza mansions which are for invited guests only the company is also building resorts in macau for a number of brandsthe holiday inn intercontinental and sheraton hotelswhen they open on the sands cotai central in the first quarter of  despite its successes las vegas sands hit hard times in  during the financial crises at one a point the company was losing  per second the stock price fell  percent within a week period to stop the bleeding adelson loaned the company billion of his own money he also continued with plans to build a  billion resortmarina bay sandsin singapore given the financial difficulties the company was facing there was skepticism about the decision to build the marina bay sands however adelson argued that with only one other competitor in singapore opening the resort would prove profitable after it opened at the end of april  it posted a  million operating profit in the first eight months of business a record in the industry the marina bay sands has three story towers with approximately  rooms and suites atop the hotel is the sands skypark a park that is set on top of the three towers the park has vegetation an observation deck several restaurants and a swimming pool that seems to flow over the building the resorts location right next to the city center allows it to serve as an entertainment site for the local population and also a destination for business travelers and mice meetings incentive convention exhibition events a year after marina bay sands opened tourism to singapore shot up  and the economy expanded by  las vegas sands continues to look for new expansion opportunities it is keeping an eye on countries such as japan korea vietnam taiwan and thailand in the us the company continues to expand its  resort in bethlehem pennsylvania which opened in  to compete with atlantic city for some of the new yorkarea market las vegas sands has also talked about the possibility of a florida resort in europe adelson and his management team were in discussions with governments in madrid and barcelona in september  las vegas sands corp announced madrid had been chosen as the destination for the gambling resort project dubbed eurovegas more precisely in february  it was reported the town of alcorcón in the outskirts of the spanish capital had been chosen as the site for the eurovegas project it was expected to take about ten years to build six casinos twelve hotels a convention center three golf courses shopping centers bars and restaurants however in december  the eurovegas project was officially canceled and it will not be established anywhere in europe in q  the company proposed a seat facility for the oakland raiders football team the total cost would be an estimated  billion and the stadium would be located near the las vegas strip and unlv it would be codeveloped with city of industry californiabased majestic realty co by estimation the stadium could be ready for nfl games by  the proposal would require  million from private investors and  million in public funding the main benefit from a stadium near the strip is the benefit to

vegas sands informed the us securities and exchange commission that it had likely violated federal law against bribery of foreign officials the company fired back at these reports stating in a press release the company did not report any violations of the antibribery provisions of the fcpa and it said news reports stating otherwise such as the headline in todays new york times which described the matter by saying casino says it likely cheated are both inflammatory and defamatory the company claimed that what it reported was that in its preliminary findings the companys audit committee had advised that there were likely violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions ie accounting provisions of the fcpa a potential violation of the accounting provisions could range anywhere from a single transaction recorded incorrectly to other errors in the accounting records the company said it will vigorously defend itself against that type of uninformed and misleading
