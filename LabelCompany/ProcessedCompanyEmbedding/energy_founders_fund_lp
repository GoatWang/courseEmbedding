associated with the capital appreciation of its investments the distributions received by the fund on equity securities of master limited partnerships mlps considered to be return of capital and for any net operating gains the fund’s accrued deferred tax liability if any is reflected each day in the fund’s net asset value per share the fund’s deferred tax liability if any depends upon the fund’s

as common stocks are subject to market economic and business risks that may cause their prices to fluctuate short sales riskshort sales that are not made “againstthebox” as defined under “description of principal investments” theoretically involve unlimited loss potential since the market price of securities sold short may continuously increase derivatives riskderivatives are subject to the risk that changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset rate or index derivatives also expose the fund to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty leverage risk leverage may increase the risk of loss cause fluctuations in the market value of the fund’s portfolio to have disproportionately large effects or cause the nav of the fund generally to decline faster than it would otherwise debt securities riskthe fund’s ability to invest in highyield debt securities generally subjects the fund to greater risk than securities with higher ratings such securities are regarded by the rating organizations as predominantly speculative with respect to capacity to pay interest and repay principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation senior loans risks  investments in senior loans involves risks similar to the risks of high yield debt securities although senior loans are typically senior and secured in contrast to below investment grade securities etf riskthe price movement of an etf may not track the underlying index and may result in a loss in addition shareholders bear both their proportionate share of the fund’s expenses and similar expenses of the underlying investment company when the fund invests in shares of another investment company nonus securities risk investments in securities of nonus issuers involve certain risks not involved in domestic investments for example expropriation or political or economic instability hedging risk although intended to limit or reduce investment risk hedging strategies may also limit or reduce the potential for profit there is no assurance that hedging strategies will be successful market riskthe fund’s share price will fluctuate with changes in the market value of its portfolio securities  many factors can affect this value and you may lose money by investing in the fund portfolio turnover riskhigh portfolio turnover will increase the fund’s transaction costs and may result in increased realization of net shortterm capital gains securities lending risk the fund may lend its portfolio securities to brokers dealers and financial institutions  the risk in lending portfolio securities as with other extensions of credit consists of possible loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower fail financially illiquid and restricted securities risk the adviser may not be able to sell illiquid or restricted securities at the price it would like or may have to sell them at a loss nondiversification riskas a nondiversified fund the fund may invest a larger portion of its assets in the securities of one or a few issuers than a diversified fund a nondiversified fund’s investment in fewer issuers may result in the fund’s shares being more sensitive to the economic results of those issuers an investment in the fund could fluctuate in value more than an investment in a diversified fund management riskthe fund relies on highland’s ability to achieve its investment objective highland may be incorrect in its assessment of the intrinsic value of companies whose securities the fund holds which may result in a decline in the value of fund shares risks related to current market conditions recently domestic and international markets have experienced a period of acute stress starting in the real estate and financial sectors and then moving to other sectors of the world economy this stress has resulted in unusual and extreme volatility in the equity markets and in the prices of individual stocks  these market conditions could add to the risk of
