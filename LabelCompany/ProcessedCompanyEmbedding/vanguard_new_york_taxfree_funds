want a lighter tax bill although taxexempt mutual funds usually produce lower yields you generally dont have to pay federal taxes on earnings from taxexempt money market and bond funds and you can save even more if you live in a state that offers similar exemptionsbut before you invest ask yourself a few questions am i investing outside of an ira or another retirement plan you wont gain anything more by including a taxexempt mutual fund in an already taxadvantaged account like an ira instead youd actually be giving up potential yields am i in one of the higher tax brackets if youre not taxexempt funds probably arent the right fit you likely wont save enough in taxes to make up for the lower yields you typically get from a taxexempt fundif you answered yes to both of these questions a taxexempt fund might be worth a look make sure a taxexempt fund is right for you your next step would be to determine your taxableequivalent yield—the yield a taxexempt fund would need to

could be hurt bystatespecific risk the chance that developments in the state such as tax legislative or political changes will adversely affect the securities held by the fund because the fund invests primarily in securities issued by one state and its municipalities it is more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in this state than are funds that invest in municipal securities of many statesinterest rate risk the chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates interest rate risk should be high for the fund because it invests primarily in longterm bonds whose prices are much more sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of shortterm bondscall risk the chance that during periods of falling interest rates issuers of callable bonds may call redeem securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates the fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates resulting in a decline in the fund’s incomeextension risk the chance that during periods of rising interest rates certain debt obligations will be paid
