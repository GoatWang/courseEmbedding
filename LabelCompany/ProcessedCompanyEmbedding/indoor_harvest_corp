platform with illumitex led lights     facebook twitter pinterest indoor harvest corp low cost vertical farming kit     facebook twitter pinterest indoor harvest corp vertical farming platform indoor harvest vertical farming platform with illumitex led lights indoor harvest corp low cost vertical farming kit houston march   prnewswire  indoor harvest corp otc pink inqd through its brand name indoor harvest™ is a design build contractor developer marketer and directseller of commercial grade aeroponic and hydroponic fixtures and supporting systems for use in urban controlled environment agriculture and building integrated agriculture the company is pleased to announce that it will be introducing its recently developed low cost vertical farming platform at indoor agcon next week in las vegas nevada indoor harvests ceo and founder chad sykes commented we believe that there is a growing demand for affordable vertical farming systems but most current offerings are still out of the price range of most entrants we looked at the current state of the industry and developed what we believe is the most cost effective platform based on current technology available the companys new vertical farming platform is designed to reduce costs by being engineered to utilize the standardized strut channel framing system strut channel is the industry standard when it comes to the construction of framing systems to support mechanical systems around the world as an addition to our platform we have developed a frame that will support either an aeroponic system or a hydroponic system and incorporates the illumitex® brand eclipse series led horticulture lighting system right out of the box the company has also engineered the related brackets and hardware to support the lighting system drivers and associated plumbing mr sykes added by making our vertical farming platform compatible with strut framing systems and a proven popular led lighting system we have created a platform that can be fully customized is affordable to even the smallest operator and can reduce the cost associated with installation with prices expected to come in around  a square foot for a complete shallow raft system including leds i believe weve developed the lowest cost system on the market while maintaining commercial grade engineering we designed this platform specifically for the smaller commercial vertical farming operator vertical farming is a new industry that has only just recently begun to gain traction over the last three years we have seen a significant increase in the number of small scale vertical farms being built to grow gourmet leafy greens herbs and microgreens for niche produce markets it is our intention to provide affordable simple to install systems to these small growers entering this new industry to date vertical farming has mostly been a doityourself business vertical farming industry entrants have had to design their own systems due to a lack of affordable platforms this more often than not has resulted in higher rd expenditures as early pioneers have had to design and redesign their systems as they go the trend has been to adapt existing industrial shelving systems such as tear drop and cantilever style systems for use in vertical farming this approach is costly because modifications must be made to these systems to adapt them for use in vertical farming these modifications dramatically increase installation labor our system has been preengineered specifically for vertical farming and designed to reduce labor costs associated with installation we will begin offering our new vertical farming platform in the second quarter of  we will be displaying our vertical farming platform at the upcoming indoor agcon march  through april

moves towards cannabis economic pilot indoor harvest corp moves towards cannabis economic pilot sep    et from indoor harvest corp houston sept   prnewswire  indoor harvest corp otcqb inqd indoor harvest or the company is a mechanical design build contractor developer marketer and directseller of commercial grade aeroponic and hydroponic vertical farming fixtures and supporting systems for use in urban controlled environment agriculture and building integrated agriculture the company is pleased to announce the initial results of the technical pilot for our aeroponic system and the next steps in the ongoing cannabis production pilot project the pilot project with tweed the leading producer of medical marijuana in canada on december   indoor harvest entered into the pilot project agreement with tweed through its parent company canopy growth corporation formerly tweed marijuana inc the pilot project tested the production of cannabis using indoor harvests highpressure aeroponic system and recorded growth rate phytocannabinoid production water usage fertilizer usage and labor required to operate the aeroponic system as part of the agreement tweed and indoor harvest will share any intellectual property resulting from the pilot project and tweed was given options on designbuild services as well as certain manufacturing rights from indoor harvest the initial aeroponic pilot project took place between march and august  a sativa dominant strain ghost train haze was selected and  plants were grown in a  x  x  system using a screen of green cultivation method in which plants are cropped and trained to produce a higher yield from a single plant the companys patent pending aeroponic system showed a significant increase in growth rate during the vegetative stage as compared to more traditional production methods such as drip irrigation using coco fertilizer usage was reduced by as much as  with the system averaging  gallons a day under high pressure sodium and  gallons a day under led operating drain to waste as tuning of the system progressed average water use was reduced to approximately  gallons per day drain to waste the company believes that through additional tuning more water savings for drain to waste and under recirculated operation can be achieved and water use could be reduced by as much as  overall under  watts of highpressure sodium lighting the aeroponic system produced  pounds of dried flowers and under  watts of led lighting produced  pounds of dried flowers in its initial test the company believes that with additional tuning yield can be increased mr chad sykes chief executive officer of indoor harvest stated according to mjchartscom ghost train haze sells at a nationwide average of approximately  per gram in the united states under led lighting in a system that has not been fully tuned that would be over  worth of what is considered in the industry as a premium grade medical product in one harvest produced on our  system that can be used by anyone who has the legal right to use our system to grow the product we wouldnt have gotten these great results if not for the extremely talented rd team and growers at tweed working together we have already made a few fascinating discoveries along the way and we will be continuing to work together to turn these discoveries into what we hope ultimately will be patentable claims further stated mr sykes on september   the company and tweed mutually agreed to extend collaborative research and development for an additional two years the company is now in the process of providing specifications and costs to build out  sqft of aeroponic production space at the tweed facility in smiths falls for the purpose of an economic pilot as part of the design build process the company will be incorporating prototype testing of our advanced racking system with integrated proprietary hvac and led lighting systems that incorporate the companys patent pending aeroponic process the aeroponic system being tested eliminates mediums and their associated contaminates provides the ability to feed and water plants with unmatched precision and incorporates highly efficient hvac and led lighting systems based upon our preliminary engineering estimates we believe that this combined system could potentially yield savings of up to  for medical cannabis producers currently utilizing more traditional hydroponic cultivation methods such as drip irrigation or flood and drain our goal is to create a platform that produces the finest medical cannabis using the least amount of resources while reducing the impact on our environment this is why the company believes that this system will prove to be the future of indoor farming of medical cannabis and indeed of indoor farming of all kinds of cultivars such as microgreens leafy greens and herbs consistent with the secs april  guidance on using social media outlets like facebook and twitter to make corporate disclosures and

of biomedical cannabidiol research courtesy of indoor harvest corp houstonbased indoor harvest corp a designbuild vertical farming engineering firm and alamo cbd a san antoniobased cannabidiol cbd

cbd not thc is the goal here much is still to be learned about cbd but vyripharm’s director of scientific public relations dr elias jackson said “early studies have shown a positive impact on certain resistant forms of cancer  based on the strength of these early studies we believe that medical cannabis will play a vital role in the treatment regimen addressing a range of cancers and that texas and the texas medical center could become a focal point for this important research”  courtesy of indoor harvest corp how is this cannabisrelated business happening in texas legally speaking the texas compassionate use act which went into effect june   requires the dps to license at least three dispensing organizations by sept   with stateoftheart cultivation techniques hightech vertical farming and clinical research and testing the alamoindoor harvest joint venture aims to be one of those three cannabis has been used in cancer treatment for thousands of years but only recently have scientists begun to understand its subtle effects preclinical research including both cell culture and animal models with cbd has had a range of effects that may be therapeutically useful including antiseizure antioxidant neuroprotective antiinflammatory analgesic antitumor antipsychotic and antianxiety properties more rigorous clinical studies are still needed to evaluate clinical potential for specific conditions thats where the new jv comes in  alamoindoor harvests operation seeks to solve major problems in clinical research supply and consistency medical science is rigorous and precise and research surrounding cbd is too often compromised by inconsistent strains inconsistent quality and an overall lack of supply if the new operation gets off the ground literally it grows

science center at houston – institute of molecular medicine sponsored research and the university of texas md anderson cancer center there is also an agreement with the national institute of drug

cannabis and medical cannabis extracts for pharmaceutical research and clinical trials across the us courtesy of indoor harvest corp the medical industrys excitement about the potential of cbd is tempered by the national regulatory environment to date  states and dc have passed laws allowing cannabis to be used for a variety of medical conditions fifteen additional states have enacted laws such as the texas compassionate use act intended to allow access to cbd oil and highcbd strains of marijuana but despite proven medical benefits and its potential given further research the dea still classifies cannabis as a schedule  narcotic as dangerous as heroin or bath salts with no accepted medical use still the green rush as its known is growing rapidly according to data from arcview market
