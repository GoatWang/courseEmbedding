shortterm investment grade interestbearing securities the company could operate even with no proceeds from this offering but that the marketing and advertising efforts would be greatly diminished thus greatly slowing the growth of the company competition within the mobile app industry is intense we believe there is no one app on the market that allows existing cellular phone users to get notifications when a better cellular plan is available according to their individual choices although we couldn’t find iphone app that do that there are many websites that offer similar service of cellular phone plan comparison many of our competitors have longer operating histories greater financial sales marketing and technological resources and longer established client relationships than we do however we believe that upm allinone bundle and relatively low price point of  flat rate will differentiate us from the competitors listed below whistle out wwwwhistleoutcom  company description uppersolutioncom was formed on april   our business will be to create an independent and unbiased mobile app that enables consumers to find the best cellular rate plan for their need and getting realtime notifications when a new cellular plan is available we intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to develop our business operations from inception until the date of this filing we have had limited operating activities we have incorporated our company and paid the state fees we have prepared a business plan we have only obtained our website url uppersolutioncom along the logo for our brand we have made highlevel decisions about the features and design of our proposed app our plan of operations needs to be executed in order to fully develop our business and begin generating revenue a number of steps have to be accomplished within the plan the company’s revenues are expected to be derived primarily from sales of the company’s apps we do not anticipate earning revenues until we have successfully launched our mobile app since we are presently in the development stage of our business we can provide no assurance that we will successfully prepare and produce our mobile app we are in the development stage of developing and commercializing a mobile app for existing cellular phone users our goal is to help consumers to save money each month by notifying them when a more costeffective plan based on their actual usage is available our mobile app to be named “upper plan monitor “upm”” will help consumers to keep track on new cellular plans from different cellular
