matthew panzarino panzer  shares next story bitmonet monetizes your blog through the power of bitcoin twitter is appointing vijaya gadde as its new general counsel after current appointee alex macgillivray has announced his plans to move on the news came as a post on macgillivray’s personal site and was shortly thereafter reported on by mike isaac at all things d techcrunch has confirmed both the departure of macgillivray and the hire of gadde with twitter macgillivray says that he is planning on dialing back his involvement with twitter over the next few months as the team transitions to new leadership “i’ll continue to support the company and its great people by staying on as an advisor for the legal trust  safety corporate development and public policy teams” says macgillivray “i continue to care deeply about twitter the folks who work at twitter and our tremendous users so i’ll remain close to all three” macgillivray was hired by twitter in  and previously served as dgc of product at ip at google gadde has been a director in twitter’s legal department since july of  and will now take on the gc role macgillivray’s former post at google had him going to bat for the company over its efforts to scan books his move there was seen as a key ‘first amendment’ hire as twitter began to be considered a platform for expression and came under attack from government agencies of various countries looking to quash or investigate statements made by users gadde was formerly an associate at wilson sonsini goodrich  rosati where macgillivray was also formerly an attorney though gadde doesn’t have the same bonafides as macgillivray when it comes to first amendment stuff she is apparently regarded well in the company and at her former firm in addition from what we’ve heard twitter will be doing some shuffling of the legal structure as well its director of public policy colin crowell will no longer report to the general counsel but will report directly to ceo dick costolo on matters affecting twitter and washington all signs at the moment are pointing towards this being a voluntary exit for macgillivray who was well liked and respected no one at twitter is happy to see him go as they might be with someone who wasn’t getting the job done macgillivray states in his post that he’s “looking forward to engaging my various internet passions from new and different perspectives seeing friends and family without distraction and just goofing off a bit” according to what we’re hearing that’s essentially the core of why he’s leaving being the bastion of free speech at a hot target like twitter can’t have been too relaxing or left a ton of free time to enjoy family there’s also the fact that macgillivray’s shares have vested after four years with the company as a bit of a going away present twitter officially won a patent case in the federal circuit court today which attempted to claim invention of twitter’s

exec on discrimination and overcoming adversityshalene guptaoct  vijaya gadde is no stranger to trying situations as twitters twtr general counsel shes faced plenty of challenges last year she was key in the tech companys public offering  and she recently helped twitter successfully sue the turkish government after the country blocked its use in march“whenever i face adversity i think about what my parents went through” gadde told fortune assistant managing editor leigh gallagher at fortunes  under  event on thursday nightthough gadde was born in india she didnt meet her father until she was three as a poor graduate student in america he wasnt initially able to support his family coming to america when gadde turned one her mother headed to the states  and two years later gadde finally met her fatherher family moved to small town texas she said they were among a handful of indians  and the kkk had a significant local presence “you don’t realize it when you’re a child” she said referring to the kkks power her father needed their permission to go doortodoor selling insurance “but when you’re in high school you realize this isn’t right”the situations unfairness inspired gadde to become a lawyer “no one messes with lawyers” gadde said before joining twitter in  she spent nearly a decade working at wilson sonsini and then spent time in the legal department of silicon valley technology firm juniper networksthe transition wasnt initially obvious to gadde “i didn’t get twitter when it came out” she admitted “my first tweet was about breakfast” but the  egyptian uprising was a turning point for her “i realized how powerful of a platform it can be” she told the audience “and i lobbied for a job there”as for her successes gadde credits preparation especially concerning twitters ipo she said the company spent two years planning for the event and they had an independent board ready a year before”that board had not a single female face on it  until former pearson pso ceo marjorie scardino joined after noisy public backlashgadde doesnt shy away from criticisms of tech companies like twitters dearth of women in leadership roles though shes the only female on twitters executive management team gadde has some tough opinions on getting more women into leadership roles her thoughts are characteristic of someone who has been fighting since she was born “all tech companies need women but i’m a big believer in only putting women in these positions only if they deserve them”correction a previous version of this story incorrectly stated that gadde had been at juniper networks
