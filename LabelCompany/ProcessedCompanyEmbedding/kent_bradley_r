treatment center in liberia when he was diagnosedbrantlys wife and children show no symptoms of ebola the cdc saysdr kent brantly answered a calling thats what friends and colleagues say about the man who garnered national headlines when he became the first known ebola hemorrhagic fever patient in the united states brantly  arrived saturday in atlanta from liberia where he and another american missionary worker contracted the deadly virus while caring for ebola patientsfrom an early age brantly was driven by his faith in god to make a difference friends and former colleagues said he took mission trips to uganda honduras nicaragua tanzania and haiti they said he intended to be a missionary before he became a doctor friend kent smith an elder at southside church of christ in fort worth texas told cnn eventually he decided medical mission is what he wanted to dobrantly went to liberia with his wife and two children last year to serve a twoyear fellowship through samaritans purse postresidency programhe was there initially to practice general medicine but when the ebola outbreak began he took on the role of medical director for the samaritans purse ebola consolidated case

many to ask why would he put himself at riskthe answer might be difficult for some to understand his former college and medical school professor wrote in an oped published this week in the indianapolis star simply put he would say that he had been called to care for the patients in liberia richard gunderman wrote in the newspaper none of it has been surprising to smith who first met brantly five years ago at church when he first started coming to our church he and his wife made it clear  they were committed to medical missions he said before heading to liberia in october  brantly did his residency at john peter smith hospital in fort worthwhat do i bring to the tablewere kind of proud that there was a hero out there trying to do his best to make life better for other folks under the circumstances a physician who knows him dr paul pepe of dallas ut southwestern medical center told cnn affiliate wfaa this weekbrantly attended high school in indianapolis before graduating from abilene christian university texas in  and indiana universitys medical school in while at abilene christian he spent a summer interning overseas with a program focused on vocational missions experiences acus online alumni magazine reportedeveryone here who has been connected with kent knows him to be someone who is very compassionate considerate and always upbeat in all he does the programs director dr gary green told the magazine  kents the kind of guy who would weigh benefits versus risk then try to take himself out of the equation so that he would be thinking what do i bring to the table is the risk worth taking because i can benefit so many peopleit perhaps may explain why when only one dose of an experimental serum to treat ebola was made available this week in liberia that brantly turned it down and asked that it be given to his colleague i would have been surprised if he had not done that smith said praying ferventlyin an email this week from monrovia brantly told a fellow doctor at john peter smith hospital that he is terrified according to the indianapolis star im praying fervently that god will help me survive this disease brantly said in an email to dr david mcray the newspaper reported though brantlys wife and children had been in liberia with him they were in the united states when he became ill many people have been asking how i am doing amber brantly said in a statement released earlier this week the children and i are physically finethe cdc has said neither brantlys wife or his children are symptomatic brantlys wife parents and sister cried when they saw him on cnn walking from the ambulance into the hospital a family representative said on condition of anonymity his wife amber later said she was relieved that her husband was back in the united statesi spoke with him and he is glad to be back in the us she said in statement sent to cnn i am thankful to god for his safe transport and for giving him the strength to walk into the

victim to be brought to the united states from africa was safely escorted into a specialized isolation unit saturday at one of the nation’s best hospitals where doctors said they are confident the deadly virus won’t escape fear that the outbreak killing more than  people in africa could spread in the us has generated anxiety among some americans infectiousdisease experts said the public faces zero risk as emory university hospital treats a critically ill missionary doctor and a charity worker who were infected in liberia photos ebola virus outbreak in west africa the us centers for disease control and prevention has received “nasty emails” and at least  calls from people saying “how dare you bring ebola into the country” said cdc director tom frieden on saturday “i hope that our understandable fear of the unfamiliar does not trump our compassion when ill americans return to the us for care” frieden said dr kent brantly who was admitted saturday and nancy writebol who will arrive in several days will be treated in emory’s isolation unit for infectious diseases created  years ago to handle doctors who get sick at the cdc just up the hill it is one of about four such units in the country equipped with everything necessary to test and treat people exposed to very dangerous viruses in  it handled patients with sars which unlike ebola can spread like the flu when an infected person coughs or sneezes the nature of ebola which is spread by close contact with bodily fluids and blood means that any modern hospital using standard rigorous infectioncontrol measures should be able to handle it emory won’t take any chances “nothing comes out of this unit until it is noninfectious” said dr bruce ribner who will be treating the patients “the bottom line is we have an inordinate amount of safety associated with the care of this patient and we do not believe that any health care worker any other patient or any visitor to our facility is in any way at risk of acquiring this infection” brantly was flown from africa to dobbins air reserve base outside atlanta in a small plane equipped to contain infectious diseases a small police escort followed his ambulance to the hospital he climbed out dressed head to toe in white protective clothing and another person in an identical hazardousmaterials suit held both of his gloved hands as they walked gingerly inside there was also only room on the plane for one patient at a time writebol will follow in several days “it was a relief to welcome kent home today i spoke with him and he is glad to be back in the us” said his wife amber who left africa with their two young children for a wedding in the us days before the doctor fell ill “i am thankful to god for his safe transport and for giving him the strength to walk into the hospital” her statement said inside the unit patients are sealed off from anyone who doesn’t wear protective gear “negative air pressure” means air flows in but can’t escape until filters scrub any germs from patients all laboratory testing is conducted within the unit and workers are highly trained in infection control glass walls enable staff outside to safely observe patients and there is a vestibule where workers suit up before entering any gear is safely disposed of or decontaminated family members will be kept outside for now the unit “has a plate glass window and communication system so they’ll be as close as  inches from each other” ribner said dr jay varkey an infectiousdisease specialist who will be treating brantly and writebol gave no word saturday about their condition both were described as critically ill after treating ebola patients at a missionary hospital in liberia one of three west african countries hit by the largest outbreak of the virus in history there is no proven cure for the virus it kills an estimated  percent to  percent of the people it infects but american doctors in africa say the mortality rate would be much lower in a functioning health care system all about ebola here are five things to know about ebola and how it is spread  the west africa ebola outbreak is now the largest in history the current outbreak in liberia guinea and sierra leone has sickened more than  people and killed more than  this year  some people have survived ebola while the fatality rate for ebola can be as high as  percent health officials in the three countries say people have recovered from the virus and the current death rate is about  percent  ebola can look a lot like other diseases the early symptoms of an ebola infection include fever headache muscle aches and sore throat according to the world health organization it can be difficult to distinguish between ebola and the symptoms of malaria typhoid fever or cholera  ebola is only spread through bodily fluids the ebola virus is not airborne so people would have to come into contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person these include blood sweat vomit feces urine saliva or semen  fear and misinformation is making things worse in each of the affected countries health workers and clinics have come under attack from panicked residents who mistakenly blame foreign doctors and nurses for bringing the virus to remote communities the associated press updated aug   the headline in an earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the american doctor with ebola he is kent brantly not kent bradley more in news photos today in history — july  july  7  am a selection of photos from around the world of events that happened on july

hospital david morrison—  samaritans purseinfectious diseasethis is what it feels like to survive eboladr kent brantlysep  time healthfor more visit time health ebola is ravaging west africa like a wildfire out of controlthe morning i woke up with ebola i felt a little warm my temperature was higher than normal but not too concerning i decided to stay home from work that morning just to play it safe i had spent the last seven weeks fighting the world’s worst ebola outbreak in liberia where i was working as a physician with samaritan’s purse i thought i just had a cold but i was not naive enough to think i was immune to the possibility of ebolaby noon my temperature had increased to  i took a rapid malaria test it was negativenot a good sign i called our team leader who sent physician colleagues to my home in full protective gearafter two more negative malaria tests i knew i would be in isolation for at least three more days often the blood test for ebola will remain negative for the first three days of illness so we had to wait a few days for an accurate result in the meantime i grew sicker my fever hit  i felt nauseated and began having diarrhea eventually the team started an iv in my arm and gave me fluids we all hoped it could be dengue feveron the fourth day the team leader came to my bedroom window with news “kent buddy we have your test results i am really sorry to tell you that it’s positive for ebola” i didn’t know what to think i just asked “so what’s our plan”in the middle of october  i had moved to monrovia with my wife amber and two children we planned to serve as medical missionaries with samaritan’s purse for two years the first time i heard about the ebola outbreak was at the end of march at a picnic for expatriates living in the area someone asked if i had heard about the ebola outbreak in guinea i had not but within a couple of months i was one of only two doctors in monrovia treating ebola patientsdr kent brantly and his wife amber and their children in liberia before dr brantly was infected with ebola samaritans purse on june  our hospital called elwa eternal love winning africa received a call from the ministry of health they were bringing two ebola patients to our isolation unit in the two hours it took for us to prepare everything one of the patients died in the ambulance over the next month and a half the number of patients grew exponentially we were overwhelmedon july  we opened a larger isolation unit and consolidated our smaller facility with the patients from another nearby hospital that’s the same day i dropped off amber and the kids at the airport to return to texas for a family wedding i was supposed to meet them a week later but just three days after their departure i got sickrelatedebolathird american ebola patient arrives in omahaebolathird american ebola patient arrives in omahaeven with the bad news i felt calm i never shed a tear when i called my wife and said “amber my test is positive i have ebola” though the rest of my family wept i felt strangely at peace god blessed me with that peace that surpasses understanding since we had started treating patients with ebola in monrovia we had only had one survivor i had watched too many people die from this disease amber and i were both at the disadvantage of knowing how this illness endsat some point i was told about an experimental drug it had worked on monkeys but had never been tested in humans i agreed to receive it but then decided that nancy writebol should get it first since she was sicker i was not trying to be a hero i was making a rational decision as a doctorover the next couple of days though my condition worsened my body began shaking my heart was racing nothing would bring down my temperature and i had fluid in my lungs i felt hot nauseated weakeverything was a blur i had friends and colleagues praying outside my houseand all over the world the doctor decided to give me the drug and within an hour my body stabilized a bit it was enough improvement for me to be safely evacuated to emory university hospital in atlantaduring my own care i often thought about the patients i had treated ebola is a humiliating disease that strips you of your dignity you are removed from family and put into isolation where you cannot even see the faces of those caring for you due to the protective suitsyou can only see their eyes you have uncontrollable diarrhea and it is embarrassing you have to rely on others to clean you up that is why we tried our best to treat patients like our own family through our protective gear we spoke to each patient calling them by name and touching them we wanted them to know they were valuable that they were loved and that we were there to serve themat emory the doctors were able to see that my potassium level was low and replenish itsomething that could not be done in liberia and could have killed me i finally cried for the first time when i saw my family members through a window and spoke to them over the intercom i had not been sure i would ever see them again when i finally recovered the nurses excitedly helped me leave the isolation room and i held my wife in my arms for the first time in a montheven when i was facing death i remained full of faith i did not want to be faithful to god all the way up to serving in liberia for ten months only to give up at the end because i was sick though we cannot return to liberia right now it is clear we have been given a new platform for helping the people of liberiaebola has changed everything in west africa we cannot sit back and say “oh those poor people” we must think outside the box and find ways to help people are fearful of isolation units because “that is where you go to die” they stay home instead and infect their families perhaps we need to find a way to provide safe home care that protects the caregivers the national governments of west africa are overwhelmed they are not capable of handling this outbreak with simply a little help from some ngos this is a global problem and it requires the action of national governments around the world we must take action to stop itnowdr kent brantly is a
