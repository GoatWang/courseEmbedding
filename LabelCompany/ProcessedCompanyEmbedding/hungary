orders created private ownership of land there are three forms of existenceclarification needed the royal ecclesiastical and secular private estate the royal estate of the árpád dynasty had evolved from the tribal landsclarification needed the origin of the secular private holdings dates back to the conquest tribal common estatesclarification needed which are increasingly in charge of the society and grows over private ownership of the becoming leaders however from the founding of the state the royal gift also entered the multiplying factors secular private property line this organization developed a feudal estate which had two elements the ancient estate and the possessions which were awarded by saint stephen i and then the royal donations over the holder unrestricted right granted by the latter lineal heir almost returned to the king in the order of the laws changed in  which abolished the nobilitys possessions for free disposal it forbidden the nobility to sale their inherited land the carpathian basin was more suitable for agriculture than large livestock grazing and therefore increased steadily in the former weight in the th and th centuries natural farming and soil changer tillage systems met grazing the animals and they used the fertilized land until depletion the most important tools for the agriculture were the plow and the ox anjou ageedit hungarian economy prior to the transitionedit the berthold and manfred weiss canned food factory  chamber of commerce and industry of budapest beginning of the th century the hungarian economy prior to world war ii was primarily oriented toward agriculture and smallscale manufacturing hungarys strategic position in europe and its relative high lack of natural resources also have dictated a traditional reliance on foreign trade for instance its largest car manufacturer magomobil maker of the magosix produced a total of a few thousand units in the early s the textile industry began to expand rapidly by  it became the most important industry in the foreign trade of hungary exporting textile goods worth more than  million pengős in that year companies like mávag exported locomotives to india and southamerica its locomotive no  was the largest and most powerful in europe at the time from the late s the communist government started to nationalise the industry at first only factories with more than  workers were nationalized later this limit was reduced to only  in the agriculture the government started a disastrous programme of collectivization from the early s more and more new factories were built this rapid and forced industrialization followed the standard stalinist pattern in an effort to encourage a more selfsufficient economy most economic activity was conducted by stateowned enterprises or cooperatives and state farms in  stalinist selfsufficiency was replaced by the new economic mechanism which reopened hungary to foreign trade gave limited freedom to the workings of the market and allowed a limited number of small businesses to operate in the services sector although hungary enjoyed one of the most liberal and economically advanced economies of the former eastern bloc both agriculture and industry began to suffer from a lack of investment in the s and hungarys net foreign debt rose significantly—from  billion in  to  billion in —due largely to consumer subsidies and unprofitable state enterprises in the face of economic stagnation hungary opted to try further liberalization by passing a joint venture law instating an income tax and joining the international monetary fund imf and the world bank by  hungary had developed a twotier banking system and had enacted significant corporate legislation which paved the way for the ambitious marketoriented reforms of the postcommunist years transition to a market economyedit ing headquarters in budapest after the fall of communism the former eastern bloc had to transition from a oneparty centrally planned economy to a market economy with a multiparty political system with the collapse of the soviet union the eastern bloc countries suffered a significant loss in both markets for goods and subsidizing from the soviet unioncitation needed hungary for example lost nearly  of its export markets in eastern and central europe the loss of external markets in hungary left  unemployed people because all the unprofitable and unsalvageable factories had been closed another form of soviet subsidizing that greatly affected hungary after the fall of communism was the loss of social welfare programsoriginal research because of the lack of subsidies and a need to reduce expenditures many social programs in hungary had to be cut in an attempt to lower spending as a result many people in hungary suffered incredible hardships during the transition to a market economy following privatization and tax reductions on hungarian businesses unemployment suddenly rose to  in  it was  in   gradually decreasing until  economic growth after a fall in  to − gradually grew until the end of the s at an average annual rate of  with the stabilization of the new market economy hungary has experienced growth in foreign investment with a cumulative foreign direct investment totaling more than  billion since  the antall government of – began market reforms with price and trade liberation measures a revamped tax system and a nascent marketbased banking system by  however the costs of government overspending and hesitant privatization had become clearly visible cuts in consumer subsidies led to increases in the price of food medicine transportation services and energy reduced exports to the former soviet bloc and shrinking industrial output contributed to a sharp decline in gdp unemployment rose rapidly to about  in  the external debt burden one of the highest in europe reached  of annual export earnings while the budget and current account deficits approached  of gdp the devaluation of the currency in order to support exports without effective stabilization measures such as indexation of wages provoked an extremely high inflation rate that in  reached  and slightly decreased until  growing again in  in march  the government of prime minister gyula horn implemented an austerity program coupled with aggressive privatization of stateowned enterprises and an exportpromoting exchange raw regime to reduce indebtedness cut the current account deficit and shrink public spending by the end of  the consolidated public sector deficit decreased to  of gdp—with public sector spending falling from  of gdp to below —the current account deficit was reduced to  of gdp and government debt was paid down to  of annual export earnings megyeri bridge the government of hungary no longer requires imf financial assistance and has repaid all of its debt to the fund consequently hungary enjoys favorable borrowing terms hungarys sovereign foreign currency debt issuance carries investmentgrade ratings from all major creditrating agencies although recently the country was downgraded by moodys sp and remains on negative outlook at fitch in  hungarys currency the forint huf became convertible for all current account transactions and subsequent to oecd membership in  for almost all capital account transactions as well since  hungary has pegged the forint against a basket of currencies in which the us dollar is  and the central rate against the basket is devalued at a preannounced rate originally set at  per month the forint is now an entirely freefloating currency the government privatization program ended on schedule in   of gdp is now produced by the private sector and foreign owners control  of financial institutions  of industry  of telecommunications and  of the trading sector kőröshegy viaduct after hungarys gdp declined about  from  to  and grew only – up to  strong export performance has propelled gdp growth to  in  with other macroeconomic indicators similarly improving these successes allowed the government to concentrate in  and  on major structural reforms such as the implementation of a fully funded pension system partly modelled after chiles pension system with major modifications reform of higher education and the creation of a national treasury remaining economic challenges include reducing fiscal deficits and inflation maintaining stable external balances and completing structural reforms of the tax system health care and local government financing recently the overriding goal of hungarian economic policy has been to prepare the country for entry into the european union which it joined in late  prior to the change of regime in   of hungarys trade was with comecon countries by the end of  hungary had shifted much of its trade to the west trade with eu countries and the oecd now comprises over  and  of the total respectively germany is hungarys single most important trading partner the us has become hungarys sixthlargest export market while hungary is ranked as the nd largest export market for the us bilateral trade between the two countries increased  in  to more than  billion the

foreign direct investment fdi since  hungary has attracted over onethird of all fdi in central and eastern europe including the former soviet union of this about  billion came from american companies foreign capital is attracted by skilled and relatively inexpensive labor tax incentives modern infrastructure and a good telecommunications system by  hungary’s economic outlook had deteriorated wage growth had kept up with other nations in the region however this growth has largely been driven by increased government spending this has resulted in the budget deficit ballooning to over  of gdp and inflation rates predicted to exceed  this prompted nouriel roubini a white house economist in the clinton administration to state that hungary is an accident waiting to happen privatization in hungaryedit in january  the state privatization agency spa állami vagyonügynökség was established to manage the first steps of privatization because of hungarys  billion foreign debt the government decided to sell state property instead of distributing it to the people for free the spa was attacked by populist groups because several companies management had the right to find buyers and discuss sale terms with them thus stealing the company another reason for discontent was that the state offered large tax subsidies and environmental investments which sometimes cost more than the selling price of the company along with the acquisition of companies foreign investors launched many greenfield investments the centerright hungarian democratic forum government of – decided to demolish agricultural cooperatives by splitting them up and giving machinery and land to their former members the government also introduced a recompensation law which offered vouchers to people who had owned land before it was nationalized in  these people or their descendants could exchange their vouchers for land previously owned by agricultural cooperatives who were forced to give up some of their land for this purpose small stores and retail businesses were privatized between  and  however greenfield investments by foreign retail companies like tesco cora and ikea had a much bigger economic impact many public utilities including the national telecommunications company matáv the national oil and gas conglomerate mol group and electricity supply and production companies were privatized as well though most banks were sold to foreign investors the largest bank national savings bank otp remained hungarianowned  of the shares were sold to foreign institutional investors and given to the social

judgement of foreign analysts on economic outlook due to high demand in import goods hungary also had a high trade deficit  and budget gap and it could not reach an agreement with the imf either after not having a minister of finance for more than a month prime minister gyula horn appointed lajos bokros as finance minister on  march  he introduced a string of austerity measures the bokros package on  march  which had the following key points onetime  devaluation of the forint introducing a constant sliding devaluation  additional customs duty on all goods except for energy sources limitation of growth of wages in the public sector simplified and accelerated privatization the package also included welfare cutbacks including abolition of free higher education and dental service reduced family allowances childcare benefits and maternity payments depending on income and wealth lowering subsidies of pharmaceuticals and raising retirement age these reforms not only increased investor confidence but they were also supported by the imf and the world bank however they were not welcome widely by the hungarians bokros broke the negative record of popularity  of the population wanted to see him in an important political position  and only  were convinced that the reforms would improve the countrys finances in a big way  in  the ministry of finance introduced a new pension system instead of the fully statebacked one private pension savings accounts were introduced which were  social security based and  funded in  prime minister ferenc gyurcsány was reelected on a platform promising economic “reform without austerity” however after the elections in april  the socialist coalition under gyurcsány unveiled a package of austerity measures which were designed to reduce the budget deficit to  of gdp by  because of the austerity program the economy of hungary slowed down in   financial crisisedit declining exports reduced domestic consumption and fixed asset accumulation hit hungary hard during the financial crisis of  making the country enter a severe recession of  one of the worst economic contractions in its history on  october  hungary reached an agreement with the imf and eu for a rescue package of us billion aiming to restore financial stability and investors confidence because of the uncertainty of the crisis banks gave less loans which led to a decrease in investment this along with priceawareness and fear of bankruptcy led to a fallback in consumption which then increased job losses and decreased consumption even further inflation did not rise significantly but real wages decreased the fact that the euro and the swiss franc are worth a lot more in forints than they were before affected a lot of people according to the daily telegraph statistics show that more than  percent of hungarian mortgages and car loans are denominated in foreign currencies after the election in  of the new fideszparty government of prime minister viktor orbán hungarian banks were forced to allow the conversion of foreigncurrency mortgages to the forint the new government also nationalised  billion of private pensionfund assets which could then be used to support the government debt position presentday hungarian economyedit the economy showed signs of recovery in  with decreasing tax rates and a moderate  percent gdp growth from november  to january  all three major credit rating agencies downgraded hungarian debt to a noninvestment speculative grade commonly called junk status in part this is because of political changes creating doubts about the independence of the hungarian national bank european commission president josé manuel barroso wrote to prime minister viktor orbán stating that new central bank regulations allowing political intervention seriously harm hungarys interests postponing talks on a financial aid package orbán responded if we don’t reach an agreement we’ll still stand on our own feet the european commission launched legal proceedings against hungary on  january  the procedures concern hungary’s central bank law the retirement age for judges and prosecutors and the independence of the data protection office respectively one day later orbán indicated in a letter his willingness to find solutions to the problems raised in the infringement proceedings on  january he participated in plenary session of the european parliament which also dealt with the hungarian case he said hungary has been renewed and reorganised under european principles he also said that the problems raised by the european union can be resolved “easily simply and very quickly” he added that none of the ec’s objections affected hungary’s new constitution following the mild recession of  the gdp picked up again from  and based on the commission’s winter  forecast it was projected to have accelerated to  the more dynamic economic performance attributed to a moderately growing domestic demand and supported the growth of gross fixed capital formation the surge  in the first half of  however was only achieved via temporary measures and factors such as the steppedup absorption of eufunds and the central bank’s funding for growth scheme which subsidised loans for smalland mediumsized enterprises the fundaments of growth didnt considerably change in  as well  the government supported eufund transfers along with the moderately successful central bank loans of economic revitalization  fueled the fair gdp growth however from the beginning of  the significantly shrunk base of available eufunds had an immediate impact on the countrys performance the disappointing quarterly data showed a mere  hike beating most expectations therefore the government may need to revise its yearonyear growth in the

the roma employment rate decreased significantly following the fall of communism due to the tremendous layoffs of unskilled workers during the transition years more than onethird of roma were excluded from the labour market therefore this ethnic conflict is inherently interconnected with the income inequalities in the country – at least twothirds of the poorest  people in hungary are romas furthermore ethnic discrimination is outstandingly high  of romas experience discrimination when looking for work consequently new roma entrants to the labour market are rarely able to find employment which creates a motivation deficit and further reinforces segregation and unemployment institutional qualityedit twenty years after the change of the regime corruption remains to be a severe issue in

this can be traced back to historical reasons such as socialist economic tradition as well as cultural characteristics that endorse paternalist behaviour on the state’s part meaning that people have a habitual reflex that make them call for state subsidies some economistswho dispute this point claiming that expenditure ran up to today’s critical amount from  during two leftwing government cycles along with joining the eu the country undertook the task of joining the eurozone as well therefore the maastricht criteria which forms the condition of joining the eurozone acts as an authoritative guideline to hungarian fiscal politics although there has been remarkable progress recent years’ statistics still point at significant discrepancies between the criteria and fiscal indices the target date for adapting the euro has not been fixed either general government deficit has shown a drastic decline to   from   according to an mnb forecast however until  the deficit will by a small margin fall short of the  criterion another criterion that is found lacking is the ratio of gross government debt to gdp which since  exceeds the allowed  according to an esa figure in  the ratio increased

hungarian economyedit árpád ageedit in the age of feudalism the key economic factor was land the new economic and social orders created private ownership of land there are three forms of existenceclarification needed the royal ecclesiastical and secular private estate the royal estate of the árpád dynasty had evolved from the tribal landsclarification needed the origin of the secular private holdings dates back to the conquest tribal common estatesclarification needed which are increasingly in charge of the society and grows over private ownership of the becoming leaders however from the founding of the state the royal gift also entered the multiplying factors secular private property line this organization developed a feudal estate which had two elements the ancient estate and the possessions which were awarded by saint stephen i and then the royal donations over the holder unrestricted right granted by the latter lineal heir almost returned to the king in the order of the laws changed in  which abolished the nobilitys possessions for free disposal it forbidden the nobility to sale their inherited land the carpathian basin was more suitable for agriculture than large livestock grazing and therefore increased steadily in the former weight in the th and th centuries natural farming and soil changer tillage systems met grazing the animals and they used the fertilized land until depletion the most important tools for the agriculture were the plow and the ox anjou ageedit hungarian economy prior to the transitionedit the berthold and manfred weiss canned food factory  chamber of commerce and industry of budapest beginning of the th century the hungarian economy prior to world war ii was primarily oriented toward agriculture and smallscale manufacturing hungarys strategic position in europe and its relative high lack of natural resources also have dictated a traditional reliance on foreign trade for instance its largest car manufacturer magomobil maker of the magosix produced a total of a few thousand units in the early s the textile industry began to expand rapidly by  it became the most important industry in the foreign trade of hungary exporting textile goods worth more than  million pengős in that year companies like mávag exported locomotives to india and southamerica its locomotive no  was the largest and most powerful in europe at the time from the late s the communist government started to nationalise the industry at first only factories with more than  workers were nationalized later this limit was reduced to only  in the agriculture the government started a disastrous programme of collectivization from the early s more and more new factories were built this rapid and forced industrialization followed the standard stalinist pattern in an effort to encourage a more selfsufficient economy most economic activity was conducted by stateowned enterprises or cooperatives and state farms in  stalinist selfsufficiency was replaced by the new economic mechanism which reopened hungary to foreign trade gave limited freedom to the workings of the market and allowed a limited number of small businesses to operate in the services sector although hungary enjoyed one of the most liberal and economically advanced economies of the former eastern bloc both agriculture and industry began to suffer from a lack of investment in the s and hungarys net foreign debt rose significantly—from  billion in  to  billion in —due largely to consumer subsidies and unprofitable state enterprises in the face of economic stagnation hungary opted to try further liberalization by passing a joint venture law instating an income tax and joining the international monetary fund imf and the world bank by  hungary had developed a twotier banking system and had enacted significant corporate legislation which paved the way for the ambitious marketoriented reforms of the postcommunist years transition to a market economyedit ing headquarters in budapest after the fall of communism the former eastern bloc had to transition from a oneparty centrally planned economy to a market economy with a multiparty political system with the collapse of the soviet union the eastern bloc countries suffered a significant loss in both markets for goods and subsidizing from the soviet unioncitation needed hungary for example lost nearly  of its export markets in eastern and central europe the loss of external markets in hungary left  unemployed people because all the unprofitable and unsalvageable factories had been closed another form of soviet subsidizing that greatly affected hungary after the fall of communism was the loss of social welfare programsoriginal research because of the lack of subsidies and a need to reduce expenditures many social programs in hungary had to be cut in an attempt to lower spending as a result many people in hungary suffered incredible hardships during the transition to a market economy following privatization and tax reductions on hungarian businesses unemployment suddenly rose to  in  it was  in   gradually decreasing until  economic growth after a fall in  to − gradually grew until the end of the s at an average annual rate of  with the stabilization of the new market economy hungary has experienced growth in foreign investment with a cumulative foreign direct investment totaling more than  billion since  the antall government of – began market reforms with price and trade liberation measures a revamped tax system and a nascent marketbased banking system by  however the costs of government overspending and hesitant privatization had become clearly visible cuts in consumer subsidies led to increases in the price of food medicine transportation services and energy reduced exports to the former soviet bloc and shrinking industrial output contributed to a sharp decline in gdp unemployment rose rapidly to about  in  the external debt burden one of the highest in europe reached  of annual export earnings while the budget and current account deficits approached  of gdp the devaluation of the currency in order to support exports without effective stabilization measures such as indexation of wages provoked an extremely high inflation rate that in  reached  and slightly decreased until  growing again in  in march  the government of prime minister gyula horn implemented an austerity program coupled with aggressive privatization of stateowned enterprises and an exportpromoting exchange raw regime to reduce indebtedness cut the current account deficit and shrink public spending by the end of  the consolidated public sector deficit decreased to  of gdp—with public sector spending falling from  of gdp to below —the current account deficit was reduced to  of gdp and government debt was paid down to  of annual export earnings megyeri bridge the government of hungary no longer requires imf financial assistance and has repaid all of its debt to the fund consequently hungary enjoys favorable borrowing terms hungarys sovereign foreign currency debt issuance carries investmentgrade ratings from all major creditrating agencies although recently the country was downgraded by moodys sp and remains on negative outlook at fitch in  hungarys currency the forint huf became convertible for all current account transactions and subsequent to oecd membership in  for almost all capital account transactions as well since  hungary has pegged the forint against a basket of currencies in which the us dollar is  and the central

declined about  from  to  and grew only – up to  strong export performance has propelled gdp growth to  in  with other macroeconomic indicators similarly improving these successes allowed the government to concentrate in  and  on major structural reforms such as the implementation of a fully funded pension system partly modelled after chiles pension system with major modifications reform of higher education and the creation of a national treasury remaining economic challenges include reducing fiscal deficits and inflation maintaining stable external balances and completing structural

incentives modern infrastructure and a good telecommunications system by  hungary’s economic outlook had deteriorated wage growth had kept up with other nations in the region however this growth has largely been driven by increased government spending this has resulted in the budget deficit ballooning to over  of gdp and inflation rates predicted to exceed  this prompted nouriel roubini a white house economist in the clinton administration to state that hungary is an accident waiting to happen privatization in hungaryedit in january  the state privatization agency spa állami vagyonügynökség was established to manage the first steps of privatization because of hungarys  billion foreign debt the government decided to sell state property instead of distributing it to the people for free the spa was attacked by populist groups because several companies management had the right to find buyers and discuss sale terms with them thus stealing the company another reason for discontent was that the state offered large tax subsidies and environmental investments which sometimes cost more than the selling price of the company along with the acquisition of companies foreign investors launched many greenfield investments the centerright hungarian democratic forum government of – decided to demolish agricultural cooperatives by splitting them up and giving machinery and land to their former members the government also introduced a recompensation law which offered vouchers to people who had owned land before it was nationalized in  these people or their descendants could exchange their vouchers for land previously owned by agricultural cooperatives who were forced to give up some of their land for this purpose small stores and retail businesses were privatized between  and  however greenfield investments by foreign retail companies like tesco cora and ikea had a much bigger economic impact many public utilities including the national telecommunications company matáv the national oil and gas conglomerate mol group and electricity supply and production companies were privatized as well though most banks were sold to foreign investors the largest bank national savings bank otp

countries and the eu reaching  hungarys fiscal indices deteriorated foreign investment fell as well as judgement of foreign analysts on economic outlook due to high demand in import goods hungary also had a high trade deficit  and budget gap and it could not reach an agreement with the imf either after not having a minister of finance for more than a month prime minister gyula horn appointed lajos bokros as finance minister on  march  he introduced a string of austerity measures the bokros package on  march  which had the following key points onetime  devaluation of the forint introducing a constant sliding devaluation  additional customs duty on all goods except for energy sources limitation of growth of wages in the public sector simplified and accelerated privatization the package also included welfare cutbacks including abolition of free higher education and dental service reduced family allowances childcare benefits and maternity payments depending on income and wealth lowering subsidies of pharmaceuticals and raising retirement age these reforms not only increased investor confidence but they were also supported by the imf and the world bank however they were not welcome widely by the hungarians bokros broke the negative record of popularity  of the population wanted to see him in an important political position  and only  were convinced that the reforms would improve the countrys finances in a big way  in  the ministry of finance introduced a new pension system instead of the fully statebacked one private pension savings accounts were introduced which were  social security based and  funded in  prime minister ferenc gyurcsány was reelected on a platform promising economic “reform without austerity” however after the elections in april  the socialist coalition under gyurcsány unveiled a package of austerity measures which were designed to reduce the budget deficit to  of gdp by  because of the austerity program the economy of hungary slowed down in   financial crisisedit declining exports reduced domestic consumption and fixed asset accumulation hit hungary hard during the financial crisis of  making the country enter a severe recession of  one of the worst economic contractions in its history on  october  hungary reached an agreement with the imf and eu for a rescue package of us billion aiming to restore financial stability and investors confidence because of the uncertainty of the crisis banks gave less loans which led to a decrease in investment this along with priceawareness and fear of bankruptcy led to a fallback in consumption which then increased job losses and decreased consumption even further inflation did not rise significantly but real wages decreased the fact that the euro and the swiss franc are worth a lot more in forints than they were before affected a lot of people according to the daily telegraph statistics show that more than  percent of hungarian mortgages and car loans are denominated in foreign currencies after the election in  of the new fideszparty government of prime minister viktor orbán hungarian banks were forced to allow the conversion of foreigncurrency mortgages to the

signs of recovery in  with decreasing tax rates and a moderate  percent gdp growth from november  to january  all three major credit rating agencies downgraded hungarian debt to a noninvestment speculative grade commonly called junk status in part this is because of political changes creating doubts about the independence of the hungarian national bank european commission president josé manuel barroso wrote to prime minister viktor orbán stating that new central bank regulations allowing political intervention seriously harm hungarys interests postponing talks on a financial aid package orbán responded if we don’t reach an agreement we’ll still stand on our own feet the european commission launched legal proceedings against hungary on  january  the procedures concern hungary’s central bank law the retirement age for judges and prosecutors and the independence of the data protection office respectively one day later orbán indicated in a letter his willingness to find solutions to the problems raised in the infringement proceedings on  january he participated in plenary session of the european parliament which also dealt with the hungarian case he said hungary has been renewed and reorganised under european principles he also said that the problems raised by the european union can be resolved “easily simply and very quickly” he added that none of the ec’s objections affected hungary’s new constitution following the mild recession of  the gdp picked up again from  and based on the commission’s winter  forecast it was projected to have accelerated to  the more dynamic economic performance attributed to a moderately growing domestic demand and supported the growth of gross fixed capital formation the surge  in the first half of  however was only achieved via temporary measures and factors such as the steppedup absorption of eufunds and the central bank’s funding for growth scheme which subsidised loans for smalland mediumsized enterprises the fundaments of growth didnt considerably change in  as well  the government supported eufund transfers along with the moderately successful central bank loans of economic revitalization  fueled the fair gdp growth however from the beginning of  the significantly shrunk base of available eufunds had an immediate impact on the countrys performance the disappointing quarterly data showed a mere

although the definition of the roma identity is controversial qualitative studies prove that the roma employment rate decreased significantly following the fall of communism due to the tremendous layoffs of unskilled workers during the transition years more than onethird of roma were excluded from the labour market therefore this ethnic conflict is inherently interconnected with the income inequalities in the country – at least twothirds of the poorest  people in hungary are romas furthermore ethnic discrimination is outstandingly high  of romas experience discrimination when looking for work consequently new roma entrants to the labour market are rarely able to find employment which creates a motivation deficit and further reinforces segregation and unemployment institutional

in hungary state revenue makes up  and expenditure makes up  of the gdp which is relatively high compared to other eu members this can be traced back to historical reasons such as socialist economic tradition as well as cultural characteristics that endorse paternalist behaviour on the state’s part meaning that people have a habitual reflex that make them call for state subsidies some economistswho dispute this point claiming that expenditure ran up to today’s critical amount from  during two leftwing government cycles along with joining the eu the country undertook the task of joining the eurozone as well therefore the maastricht criteria which forms the condition of joining the eurozone acts as an authoritative guideline to hungarian fiscal politics although there has been remarkable progress recent years’ statistics still point at significant discrepancies between the criteria and fiscal indices the target date for adapting the euro has not been fixed either general government deficit has shown a drastic decline to   from   according to an mnb forecast however until  the deficit will by a small margin fall short of the  criterion another criterion that is found lacking is the ratio of gross government debt to gdp which since  exceeds the allowed  according to an esa figure in  the ratio increased from  to  which primarily results from the requisition of an imfarranged financial assistance package hungary’s balance of payments on its current account has been negative since  around  in the s reaching a negative peak  in  still current account deficit will

hungarian economyedit árpád ageedit in the age of feudalism the key economic factor was land the new economic and social orders created private ownership of land there are three forms of existenceclarification needed the royal ecclesiastical and secular private estate the royal estate of the árpád dynasty had evolved from the tribal landsclarification needed the origin of the secular private holdings dates back to the conquest tribal common estatesclarification needed which are increasingly in charge of the society and grows over private ownership of the becoming leaders however from the founding of the state the royal gift also entered the multiplying factors secular private property line this organization developed a feudal estate which had two elements the ancient estate and the possessions which were awarded by saint stephen i and then the royal donations over the holder unrestricted right granted by the latter lineal heir almost returned to the king in the order of the laws changed in  which abolished the nobilitys possessions for free disposal it forbidden the nobility to sale their inherited land the carpathian basin was more suitable for agriculture than large livestock grazing and therefore increased steadily in the former weight in the th and th centuries natural farming and soil changer tillage systems met grazing the animals and they used the fertilized land until depletion the most important tools for the agriculture were the plow and the ox anjou ageedit hungarian economy prior to the transitionedit the berthold and manfred weiss canned food factory  chamber of commerce and industry of budapest beginning of the th century the hungarian economy prior to world war ii was primarily oriented toward agriculture and smallscale manufacturing hungarys strategic position in europe and its relative high lack of natural resources also have dictated a traditional reliance on foreign trade for instance its largest car manufacturer magomobil maker of the magosix produced a total of a few thousand units in the early s the textile industry began to expand rapidly by  it became the most important industry in the foreign trade of hungary exporting textile goods worth more than  million pengős in that year companies like mávag exported locomotives to india and southamerica its locomotive no  was the largest and most powerful in europe at the time from the late s the communist government started to nationalise the industry at first only factories with more than  workers were nationalized later this limit was reduced to only  in the agriculture the government started a disastrous programme of collectivization from the early s more and more new factories were built this rapid and forced industrialization followed the standard stalinist pattern in an effort to encourage a more selfsufficient economy most economic activity was conducted by stateowned enterprises or cooperatives and state farms in  stalinist selfsufficiency was replaced by the new economic mechanism which reopened hungary to foreign trade gave limited freedom to the workings of the market and allowed a limited number of small businesses to operate in the services sector although hungary enjoyed one of the most liberal and economically advanced economies of the former eastern bloc both agriculture and industry began to suffer from a lack of investment in the s and hungarys net foreign debt rose significantly—from  billion in  to  billion in —due largely to consumer subsidies and unprofitable state enterprises in the face of economic stagnation hungary opted to try further liberalization by passing a joint venture law instating an income tax and joining the international monetary fund imf and the world bank by  hungary had developed a twotier banking system and had enacted significant corporate legislation which paved the way for the ambitious marketoriented reforms of the postcommunist years transition to a market economyedit ing headquarters in budapest after the fall of communism the former eastern bloc had to transition from a oneparty centrally planned economy to a market economy with a multiparty political system with the collapse of the soviet union the eastern bloc countries suffered a significant loss in both markets for goods and subsidizing from the soviet unioncitation needed hungary for example lost nearly  of its export markets in eastern and central europe the loss of external markets in hungary left  unemployed people because all the unprofitable and unsalvageable factories had been closed another form of soviet subsidizing that greatly affected hungary after the fall of communism was the loss of social welfare programsoriginal research because of the lack of subsidies and a need to reduce expenditures many social programs in hungary had to be cut in an attempt to lower spending as a result many people in hungary suffered incredible hardships during the transition to a market economy following privatization and tax reductions on hungarian businesses unemployment suddenly rose to  in  it was  in   gradually decreasing until  economic growth after a fall in  to − gradually grew until the end of the s at an average annual rate of  with the stabilization of the new market economy hungary has experienced growth in foreign investment with a cumulative foreign direct investment totaling more than  billion since  the antall government of – began market reforms with price and trade liberation measures a revamped tax system and a nascent marketbased banking system by  however the costs of government overspending and hesitant privatization had become clearly visible cuts in consumer subsidies led to increases in the price of food medicine transportation services and energy reduced exports to the former soviet bloc and shrinking industrial output contributed to a sharp decline in gdp unemployment rose rapidly to about  in  the external debt burden one of the highest in europe reached  of annual export earnings while the budget and current account deficits approached  of gdp the devaluation of the currency in order to support exports without effective stabilization measures such as indexation of wages provoked an extremely high inflation rate that in  reached  and slightly decreased until  growing again in  in march  the government of prime minister gyula horn implemented an austerity program coupled with aggressive privatization of stateowned enterprises and an exportpromoting exchange raw regime to reduce indebtedness cut the current account deficit and shrink public spending by the end of  the consolidated public sector deficit decreased to  of gdp—with public sector spending falling from  of gdp to below —the current account deficit was reduced to  of gdp and government debt was paid down to  of annual export earnings megyeri bridge the government of hungary no longer requires imf financial assistance and has repaid all of its debt to the fund consequently hungary enjoys favorable borrowing terms hungarys sovereign foreign currency debt issuance carries investmentgrade ratings from all major creditrating agencies although recently the country was downgraded by moodys sp and remains on negative outlook at fitch in  hungarys currency the forint huf became convertible for all current account transactions and subsequent to oecd membership in  for almost all capital account transactions as well since  hungary has pegged the forint against a basket of currencies in which the us dollar is  and the central rate against the basket is devalued at a preannounced rate originally set at  per month the forint is now an entirely freefloating currency the government privatization program ended on schedule in   of gdp is now produced by the private sector and foreign owners control  of financial institutions  of industry  of telecommunications and  of the trading sector kőröshegy viaduct after hungarys gdp declined about  from  to  and grew only – up to  strong export performance has propelled gdp growth to  in  with other macroeconomic indicators similarly improving these successes allowed the government to concentrate in  and  on major structural reforms such as the implementation of a fully funded pension system partly modelled after chiles pension system with major modifications reform of higher education and the creation of a national treasury remaining economic challenges include reducing fiscal deficits and inflation maintaining stable external balances and completing structural reforms of the tax system health care and local government financing recently the overriding goal of hungarian economic policy has been to prepare the country for entry into the european union which it joined in late  prior to the change of regime in   of hungarys trade was with comecon countries by the end of  hungary had shifted much of its trade to the west trade with eu countries and the oecd

incentives modern infrastructure and a good telecommunications system by  hungary’s economic outlook had deteriorated wage growth had kept up with other nations in the region however this growth has largely been driven by increased government spending this has resulted in the budget deficit ballooning to over  of gdp and inflation rates predicted to exceed  this prompted nouriel roubini a white house economist in the clinton administration to state that hungary is an accident waiting to happen privatization in hungaryedit in january  the state privatization agency spa állami vagyonügynökség was established to manage the first steps of privatization because of hungarys  billion foreign debt the government decided to sell state property instead of distributing it to the people for free the spa was attacked by populist groups because several companies management had the right to find buyers and discuss sale terms with them thus stealing the company another reason for discontent was that the state offered large tax subsidies and environmental investments which sometimes cost more than the selling price of the company along with the acquisition of companies foreign investors launched many greenfield investments the centerright hungarian democratic forum government of – decided to demolish agricultural cooperatives by splitting them up and giving machinery and land to their former members the government also introduced a recompensation law which offered vouchers to people who had owned land before it was nationalized in  these people or their descendants could exchange their vouchers for land previously owned by agricultural cooperatives who were forced to give up some of their land for this purpose small stores and retail businesses were privatized between  and  however greenfield investments by foreign retail companies like tesco cora and ikea had a much bigger economic impact many public utilities including the national telecommunications company matáv the national oil and gas conglomerate mol group and electricity supply and production companies were privatized as well though most banks were sold to foreign investors the largest bank national savings bank otp

countries and the eu reaching  hungarys fiscal indices deteriorated foreign investment fell as well as judgement of foreign analysts on economic outlook due to high demand in import goods hungary also had a high trade deficit  and budget gap and it could not reach an agreement with the imf either after not having a minister of finance for more than a month prime minister gyula horn appointed lajos bokros as finance minister on  march  he introduced a string of austerity measures the bokros package on  march  which had the following key points onetime  devaluation of the forint introducing a constant sliding devaluation  additional customs duty on all goods except for energy sources limitation of growth of wages in the public sector simplified and accelerated privatization the package also included welfare cutbacks including abolition of free higher education and dental service reduced family allowances childcare benefits and maternity payments depending on income and wealth lowering subsidies of pharmaceuticals and raising retirement age these reforms not only increased investor confidence but they were also supported by the imf and the world bank however they were not welcome widely by the hungarians bokros broke the negative record of popularity  of the population wanted to see him in an important political position  and only  were convinced that the reforms would improve the countrys finances in a big way  in  the ministry of finance introduced a new pension system instead of the fully statebacked one private pension savings accounts were introduced which were  social security based and  funded in  prime minister ferenc gyurcsány was reelected on a platform promising economic “reform without austerity” however after the elections in april  the socialist coalition under gyurcsány unveiled a package of austerity measures which were designed to reduce the budget deficit to  of gdp by  because of the austerity program the economy of hungary slowed down in   financial crisisedit declining exports reduced domestic consumption and fixed asset accumulation hit hungary hard during the financial crisis of  making the country enter a severe recession of  one of the worst economic contractions in its history on  october  hungary reached an agreement with the imf and eu for a rescue package of us billion aiming to restore financial stability and investors confidence because of the uncertainty of the crisis banks gave less loans which led to a decrease in investment this along with priceawareness and fear of bankruptcy led to a fallback in consumption which then increased job losses and decreased consumption even further inflation did not rise significantly but real wages decreased the fact that the euro and the swiss franc are worth a lot more in forints than they were before affected a lot of people according to the daily telegraph statistics show that more than  percent of hungarian mortgages and car loans are denominated in foreign currencies after the election in  of the new fideszparty government of prime minister viktor orbán hungarian banks were forced to allow the conversion of foreigncurrency mortgages to the forint the new government also nationalised  billion of private pensionfund assets which could then be used to support the government debt position presentday hungarian economyedit the economy showed signs of recovery in  with decreasing tax rates and a moderate  percent gdp growth from november  to january  all three major credit rating agencies downgraded hungarian debt to a noninvestment speculative grade commonly called junk status in part this is because of political changes creating doubts about the independence of the hungarian national bank european commission president josé manuel barroso wrote to prime minister viktor orbán stating that new central bank regulations allowing political intervention seriously harm hungarys interests postponing talks on a financial aid package orbán responded if we don’t reach an agreement we’ll still stand on our own feet the european commission launched legal proceedings against hungary on  january  the procedures concern hungary’s central bank law the retirement age for judges and prosecutors and the independence of the data protection office respectively one day later orbán indicated in a letter his willingness to find solutions to the problems raised in the infringement proceedings on  january he participated in plenary session of the european parliament which also dealt with the hungarian case he said hungary has been renewed and reorganised under european principles he also said that the problems raised by the european union can be resolved “easily simply and very quickly” he added that none of the ec’s objections affected hungary’s new constitution following the mild recession of  the gdp picked up again from  and based on the commission’s winter  forecast it was projected to have accelerated to  the more dynamic economic performance attributed to a moderately growing domestic demand and supported the growth of gross fixed capital formation the surge  in the first half of  however was only achieved via temporary measures and factors such as the steppedup absorption of eufunds and the central bank’s funding for growth scheme which subsidised loans for smalland mediumsized enterprises the fundaments of growth didnt considerably change in  as well  the government supported eufund transfers along with the moderately successful central bank loans of economic revitalization  fueled the fair gdp growth however from the beginning of  the significantly shrunk base of available eufunds had an immediate impact on the countrys performance the disappointing quarterly data showed a mere  hike beating most expectations therefore the government may need to revise its yearonyear growth in the upcoming months physical propertiesedit natural resourcesedit main article geography of hungary

although the definition of the roma identity is controversial qualitative studies prove that the roma employment rate decreased significantly following the fall of communism due to the tremendous layoffs of unskilled workers during the transition years more than onethird of roma were excluded from the labour market therefore this ethnic conflict is inherently interconnected with the income inequalities in the country – at least twothirds of the poorest  people in hungary are romas furthermore ethnic discrimination is outstandingly high  of romas experience discrimination when looking for work consequently new roma entrants to the labour market are rarely able to find employment which creates a motivation deficit and further reinforces segregation and unemployment institutional

in hungary state revenue makes up  and expenditure makes up  of the gdp which is relatively high compared to other eu members this can be traced back to historical reasons such as socialist economic tradition as well as cultural characteristics that endorse paternalist behaviour on the state’s part meaning that people have a habitual reflex that make them call for state subsidies some economistswho dispute this point claiming that expenditure ran up to today’s critical amount from  during two leftwing government cycles along with joining the eu the country undertook the task of joining the eurozone as well therefore the maastricht criteria which forms the condition of joining the eurozone acts as an authoritative guideline to hungarian fiscal politics although there has been remarkable progress recent years’ statistics still point at significant discrepancies between the criteria and fiscal indices the target date for adapting the euro has not been fixed either general government deficit has shown a drastic decline to   from   according to an mnb forecast however until  the deficit will by a small margin fall short of the  criterion another criterion that is found lacking is the ratio of gross government debt to gdp which since  exceeds the allowed  according to an esa figure in  the ratio increased from  to  which primarily results from the requisition of an imfarranged financial assistance package hungary’s balance of payments on its current account has been negative since  around  in the s reaching a negative peak  in  still current account deficit will

hungarian economyedit árpád ageedit in the age of feudalism the key economic factor was land the new economic and social orders created private ownership of land there are three forms of existenceclarification needed the royal ecclesiastical and secular private estate the royal estate of the árpád dynasty had evolved from the tribal landsclarification needed the origin of the secular private holdings dates back to the conquest tribal common estatesclarification needed which are increasingly in charge of the society and grows over private ownership of the becoming leaders however from the founding of the state the royal gift also entered the multiplying factors secular private property line this organization developed a feudal estate which had two elements the ancient estate and the possessions which were awarded by saint stephen i and then the royal donations over the holder unrestricted right granted by the latter lineal heir almost returned to the king in the order of the laws changed in  which abolished the nobilitys possessions for free disposal it forbidden the nobility to sale their inherited land the carpathian basin was more suitable for agriculture than large livestock grazing and therefore increased steadily in the former weight in the th and th centuries natural farming and soil changer tillage systems met grazing the animals and they used the fertilized land until depletion the most important tools for the agriculture were the plow and the ox anjou ageedit hungarian economy prior to the transitionedit the berthold and manfred weiss canned food factory  chamber of commerce and industry of budapest beginning of the th century the hungarian economy prior to world war ii was primarily oriented toward agriculture and smallscale manufacturing hungarys strategic position in europe and its relative high lack of natural resources also have dictated a traditional reliance on foreign trade for instance its largest car manufacturer magomobil maker of the magosix produced a total of a few thousand units in the early s the textile industry began to expand rapidly by  it became the most important industry in the foreign trade of hungary exporting textile goods worth more than  million pengős in that year companies like mávag exported locomotives to india and southamerica its locomotive no  was the largest and most powerful in europe at the time from the late s the communist government started to nationalise the industry at first only factories with more than  workers were nationalized later this limit was reduced to only  in the agriculture the government started a disastrous programme of collectivization from the early s more and more new factories were built this rapid and forced industrialization followed the standard stalinist pattern in an effort to encourage a more selfsufficient economy most economic activity was conducted by stateowned enterprises or cooperatives and state farms in  stalinist selfsufficiency was replaced by the new economic mechanism which reopened hungary to foreign trade gave limited freedom to the workings of the market and allowed a limited number of small businesses to operate in the services sector although hungary enjoyed one of the most liberal and economically advanced economies of the former eastern bloc both agriculture and industry began to suffer from a lack of investment in the s and hungarys net foreign debt rose significantly—from  billion in  to  billion in —due largely to consumer subsidies and unprofitable state enterprises in the face of economic stagnation hungary opted to try further liberalization by passing a joint venture law instating an income tax and joining the international monetary fund imf and the world bank by  hungary had developed a twotier banking system and had enacted significant corporate legislation which paved the way for the ambitious marketoriented reforms of the postcommunist years transition to a market economyedit ing headquarters in budapest after the fall of communism the former eastern bloc had to transition from a oneparty centrally planned economy to a market economy with a multiparty political system with the collapse of the soviet union the eastern bloc countries suffered a significant loss in both markets for goods and subsidizing from the soviet unioncitation needed hungary for example lost nearly  of its export markets in eastern and central europe the loss of external markets in hungary left  unemployed people because all the unprofitable and unsalvageable factories had been closed another form of soviet subsidizing that greatly affected hungary after the fall of communism was the loss of social welfare programsoriginal research because of the lack of subsidies and a need to reduce expenditures many social programs in hungary had to be cut in an attempt to lower spending as a result many people in hungary suffered incredible hardships during the transition to a market economy following privatization and tax reductions on hungarian businesses unemployment suddenly rose to  in  it was  in   gradually decreasing until  economic growth after a fall in  to − gradually grew until the end of the s at an average annual rate of  with the stabilization of the new market economy hungary has experienced growth in foreign investment with a cumulative foreign direct investment totaling more than  billion since  the antall government of – began market reforms with price and trade liberation measures a revamped tax system and a nascent marketbased banking system by  however the costs of government overspending and hesitant privatization had become clearly visible cuts in consumer subsidies led to increases in the price of food medicine transportation services and energy reduced exports to the former soviet bloc and shrinking industrial output contributed to a sharp decline in gdp unemployment rose rapidly to about  in  the external debt burden one of the highest in europe reached  of annual export earnings while the budget and current account deficits approached  of gdp the devaluation of the currency in order to support exports without effective stabilization measures such as indexation of wages provoked an extremely high inflation rate that in  reached  and slightly decreased until  growing again in  in march  the government of prime minister gyula horn implemented an austerity program coupled with aggressive privatization of stateowned enterprises and an exportpromoting exchange raw regime to reduce indebtedness cut the current account deficit and shrink public spending by the end of  the consolidated public sector deficit decreased to  of gdp—with public sector spending falling from  of gdp to below —the current account deficit was reduced to  of gdp and government debt was paid down to  of annual export earnings megyeri bridge the government of hungary no longer requires imf financial assistance and has repaid all of its debt to the fund consequently hungary enjoys favorable borrowing terms hungarys sovereign foreign currency debt issuance carries investmentgrade ratings from all major creditrating agencies although recently the country was downgraded by moodys sp and remains on negative outlook at fitch in  hungarys currency the forint huf became convertible for all current account transactions and subsequent to oecd membership in  for almost all capital account transactions as well since  hungary has pegged the forint against a basket of currencies in which the us dollar is  and the central rate against the basket is devalued at a preannounced rate originally set at  per month the forint is now an entirely freefloating currency the government privatization program ended on schedule in   of gdp is now produced by the private sector and foreign owners control  of financial institutions  of industry  of telecommunications and  of the trading sector kőröshegy viaduct after hungarys gdp declined about  from  to  and grew only – up to  strong export performance has propelled gdp growth to  in  with other macroeconomic indicators similarly improving these successes allowed the government to concentrate in  and  on major structural reforms such as the implementation of a fully funded pension system partly modelled after chiles pension system with major modifications reform of higher education and the creation of a national treasury remaining economic challenges include reducing fiscal deficits and inflation maintaining stable external balances and completing structural reforms of the tax system health care and local government financing recently the overriding goal of hungarian economic policy has been to prepare the country for entry into the european union which it joined in late  prior to the change of regime in   of hungarys trade was with comecon countries by the end of  hungary had shifted much of its trade to the west trade with eu countries and the oecd

incentives modern infrastructure and a good telecommunications system by  hungary’s economic outlook had deteriorated wage growth had kept up with other nations in the region however this growth has largely been driven by increased government spending this has resulted in the budget deficit ballooning to over  of gdp and inflation rates predicted to exceed  this prompted nouriel roubini a white house economist in the clinton administration to state that hungary is an accident waiting to happen privatization in hungaryedit in january  the state privatization agency spa állami vagyonügynökség was established to manage the first steps of privatization because of hungarys  billion foreign debt the government decided to sell state property instead of distributing it to the people for free the spa was attacked by populist groups because several companies management had the right to find buyers and discuss sale terms with them thus stealing the company another reason for discontent was that the state offered large tax subsidies and environmental investments which sometimes cost more than the selling price of the company along with the acquisition of companies foreign investors launched many greenfield investments the centerright hungarian democratic forum government of – decided to demolish agricultural cooperatives by splitting them up and giving machinery and land to their former members the government also introduced a recompensation law which offered vouchers to people who had owned land before it was nationalized in  these people or their descendants could exchange their vouchers for land previously owned by agricultural cooperatives who were forced to give up some of their land for this purpose small stores and retail businesses were privatized between  and  however greenfield investments by foreign retail companies like tesco cora and ikea had a much bigger economic impact many public utilities including the national telecommunications company matáv the national oil and gas conglomerate mol group and electricity supply and production companies were privatized as well though most banks were sold to foreign investors the largest bank national savings bank otp

countries and the eu reaching  hungarys fiscal indices deteriorated foreign investment fell as well as judgement of foreign analysts on economic outlook due to high demand in import goods hungary also had a high trade deficit  and budget gap and it could not reach an agreement with the imf either after not having a minister of finance for more than a month prime minister gyula horn appointed lajos bokros as finance minister on  march  he introduced a string of austerity measures the bokros package on  march  which had the following key points onetime  devaluation of the forint introducing a constant sliding devaluation  additional customs duty on all goods except for energy sources limitation of growth of wages in the public sector simplified and accelerated privatization the package also included welfare cutbacks including abolition of free higher education and dental service reduced family allowances childcare benefits and maternity payments depending on income and wealth lowering subsidies of pharmaceuticals and raising retirement age these reforms not only increased investor confidence but they were also supported by the imf and the world bank however they were not welcome widely by the hungarians bokros broke the negative record of popularity  of the population wanted to see him in an important political position  and only  were convinced that the reforms would improve the countrys finances in a big way  in  the ministry of finance introduced a new pension system instead of the fully statebacked one private pension savings accounts were introduced which were  social security based and  funded in  prime minister ferenc gyurcsány was reelected on a platform promising economic “reform without austerity” however after the elections in april  the socialist coalition under gyurcsány unveiled a package of austerity measures which were designed to reduce the budget deficit to  of gdp by  because of the austerity program the economy of hungary slowed down in   financial crisisedit declining exports reduced domestic consumption and fixed asset accumulation hit hungary hard during the financial crisis of  making the country enter a severe recession of  one of the worst economic contractions in its history on  october  hungary reached an agreement with the imf and eu for a rescue package of us billion aiming to restore financial stability and investors confidence because of the uncertainty of the crisis banks gave less loans which led to a decrease in investment this along with priceawareness and fear of bankruptcy led to a fallback in consumption which then increased job losses and decreased consumption even further inflation did not rise significantly but real wages decreased the fact that the euro and the swiss franc are worth a lot more in forints than they were before affected a lot of people according to the daily telegraph statistics show that more than  percent of hungarian mortgages and car loans are denominated in foreign currencies after the election in  of the new fideszparty government of prime minister viktor orbán hungarian banks were forced to allow the conversion of foreigncurrency mortgages to the forint the new government also nationalised  billion of private pensionfund assets which could then be used to support the government debt position presentday hungarian economyedit the economy showed signs of recovery in  with decreasing tax rates and a moderate  percent gdp growth from november  to january  all three major credit rating agencies downgraded hungarian debt to a noninvestment speculative grade commonly called junk status in part this is because of political changes creating doubts about the independence of the hungarian national bank european commission president josé manuel barroso wrote to prime minister viktor orbán stating that new central bank regulations allowing political intervention seriously harm hungarys interests postponing talks on a financial aid package orbán responded if we don’t reach an agreement we’ll still stand on our own feet the european commission launched legal proceedings against hungary on  january  the procedures concern hungary’s central bank law the retirement age for judges and prosecutors and the independence of the data protection office respectively one day later orbán indicated in a letter his willingness to find solutions to the problems raised in the infringement proceedings on  january he participated in plenary session of the european parliament which also dealt with the hungarian case he said hungary has been renewed and reorganised under european principles he also said that the problems raised by the european union can be resolved “easily simply and very quickly” he added that none of the ec’s objections affected hungary’s new constitution following the mild recession of  the gdp picked up again from  and based on the commission’s winter  forecast it was projected to have accelerated to  the more dynamic economic performance attributed to a moderately growing domestic demand and supported the growth of gross fixed capital formation the surge  in the first half of  however was only achieved via temporary measures and factors such as the steppedup absorption of eufunds and the central bank’s funding for growth scheme which subsidised loans for smalland mediumsized enterprises the fundaments of growth didnt considerably change in  as well  the government supported eufund transfers along with the moderately successful central bank loans of economic revitalization  fueled the fair gdp growth however from the beginning of  the significantly shrunk base of available eufunds had an immediate impact on the countrys performance the disappointing quarterly data showed a mere  hike beating most expectations therefore the government may need to revise its yearonyear growth in the upcoming months physical propertiesedit natural resourcesedit main article geography of hungary

although the definition of the roma identity is controversial qualitative studies prove that the roma employment rate decreased significantly following the fall of communism due to the tremendous layoffs of unskilled workers during the transition years more than onethird of roma were excluded from the labour market therefore this ethnic conflict is inherently interconnected with the income inequalities in the country – at least twothirds of the poorest  people in hungary are romas furthermore ethnic discrimination is outstandingly high  of romas experience discrimination when looking for work consequently new roma entrants to the labour market are rarely able to find employment which creates a motivation deficit and further reinforces segregation and unemployment institutional

in hungary state revenue makes up  and expenditure makes up  of the gdp which is relatively high compared to other eu members this can be traced back to historical reasons such as socialist economic tradition as well as cultural characteristics that endorse paternalist behaviour on the state’s part meaning that people have a habitual reflex that make them call for state subsidies some economistswho dispute this point claiming that expenditure ran up to today’s critical amount from  during two leftwing government cycles along with joining the eu the country undertook the task of joining the eurozone as well therefore the maastricht criteria which forms the condition of joining the eurozone acts as an authoritative guideline to hungarian fiscal politics although there has been remarkable progress recent years’ statistics still point at significant discrepancies between the criteria and fiscal indices the target date for adapting the euro has not been fixed either general government deficit has shown a drastic decline to   from   according to an mnb forecast however until  the deficit will by a small margin fall short of the  criterion another criterion that is found lacking is the ratio of gross government debt to gdp which since  exceeds the allowed  according to an esa figure in  the ratio increased from  to  which primarily results from the requisition of an imfarranged financial assistance package hungary’s balance of payments on its current account has been negative since  around  in the s reaching a negative peak  in  still current account deficit will

feudalism the key economic factor was land the new economic and social orders created private ownership of land there are three forms of existenceclarification needed the royal ecclesiastical and secular private estate the royal estate of the árpád dynasty had evolved from the tribal landsclarification needed the origin of the secular private holdings dates back to the conquest tribal common estatesclarification needed which are increasingly in charge of the society and grows over private ownership of the becoming leaders however from the founding of the state the royal gift also entered the multiplying factors secular private property line this organization developed a feudal estate which had two elements the ancient estate and the possessions which were awarded by saint stephen i and then the royal donations over the holder unrestricted right granted by the latter lineal heir almost returned to the king in the order of the laws changed in  which abolished the nobilitys possessions for free disposal it forbidden the nobility to sale their inherited land the carpathian basin was more suitable for agriculture than large livestock grazing and therefore increased steadily in the former weight in the th and th centuries natural farming and soil changer tillage systems met grazing the animals and they used the fertilized land until depletion the most important tools for the agriculture were the plow and the ox anjou ageedit hungarian economy prior to the transitionedit the berthold and manfred weiss canned food factory  chamber of commerce and industry of budapest beginning of the th century the hungarian economy prior to world war ii was primarily oriented toward agriculture and smallscale manufacturing hungarys strategic position in europe and its relative high lack of natural resources also have dictated a traditional reliance on foreign trade for instance its largest car manufacturer magomobil maker of the magosix produced a total of a few thousand units in the early s the textile industry began to expand rapidly by  it became the most important industry in the foreign trade of hungary exporting textile goods worth more than  million pengős in that year companies like mávag exported locomotives to india and southamerica its locomotive no  was the largest and most powerful in europe at the time from the late s the communist government started to nationalise the industry at first only factories with more than  workers were nationalized later this limit was reduced to only  in the agriculture the government started a disastrous programme of collectivization from the early s more and more new factories were built this rapid and forced industrialization followed the standard stalinist pattern in an effort to encourage a more selfsufficient economy most economic activity was conducted by stateowned enterprises or cooperatives and state farms in  stalinist selfsufficiency was replaced by the new economic mechanism which reopened hungary to foreign trade gave limited freedom to the workings of the market and allowed a limited number of small businesses to operate in the services sector although hungary enjoyed one of the most liberal and economically advanced economies of the former eastern bloc both agriculture and industry began to suffer from a lack of investment in the s and hungarys net foreign debt rose significantly—from  billion in  to  billion in —due largely to consumer subsidies and unprofitable state enterprises in the face of economic stagnation hungary opted to try further liberalization by passing a joint venture law instating an income tax and joining the international monetary fund imf and the world bank by  hungary had developed a twotier banking system and had enacted significant corporate legislation which paved the way for the ambitious marketoriented reforms of the postcommunist years transition to a market economyedit ing headquarters in budapest after the fall of communism the former eastern bloc had to transition from a oneparty centrally planned economy to a market economy with a multiparty political system with the collapse of the soviet union the eastern bloc countries suffered a significant loss in both markets for goods and subsidizing from the soviet unioncitation needed hungary for example lost nearly  of its export markets in eastern and central europe the loss of external markets in hungary left  unemployed people because all the unprofitable and unsalvageable factories had been closed another form of soviet subsidizing that greatly affected hungary after the fall of communism was the loss of social welfare programsoriginal research because of the lack of subsidies and a need to reduce expenditures many social programs in hungary had to be cut in an attempt to lower spending as a result many people in hungary suffered incredible hardships during the transition to a market economy following privatization and tax reductions on hungarian businesses unemployment suddenly rose to  in  it was  in   gradually decreasing until  economic growth after a fall in  to − gradually grew until the end of the s at an average annual rate of  with the stabilization of the new market economy hungary has experienced growth in foreign investment with a cumulative foreign direct investment totaling more than  billion since  the antall government of – began market reforms with price and trade liberation measures a revamped tax system and a nascent marketbased banking system by  however the costs of government overspending and hesitant privatization had become clearly visible cuts in consumer subsidies led to increases in the price of food medicine transportation services and energy reduced exports to the former soviet bloc and shrinking industrial output contributed to a sharp decline in gdp unemployment rose rapidly to about  in  the external debt burden one of the highest in europe reached  of annual export earnings while the budget and current account deficits approached  of gdp the devaluation of the currency in order to support exports without effective stabilization measures such as indexation of wages provoked an extremely high inflation rate that in  reached  and slightly decreased until  growing again in  in march  the government of prime minister gyula horn implemented an austerity program coupled with aggressive privatization of stateowned enterprises and an exportpromoting exchange raw regime to reduce indebtedness cut the current account deficit and shrink public spending by the end of  the consolidated public sector deficit decreased to  of gdp—with public sector spending falling from  of gdp to below —the current account deficit was reduced to  of gdp and government debt was paid down to  of annual export earnings megyeri bridge the government of hungary no longer requires imf financial assistance and has repaid all of its debt to the fund consequently hungary enjoys favorable borrowing terms hungarys sovereign foreign currency debt issuance carries investmentgrade ratings from all major creditrating agencies although recently the country was downgraded by moodys sp and remains on negative outlook at fitch in  hungarys currency the forint huf became convertible for all current account transactions and subsequent to oecd membership in  for almost all capital account transactions as well since  hungary has pegged the forint against a basket of currencies in which the us dollar is  and the central rate against the basket is devalued at a preannounced rate originally set at  per month the forint is now an entirely freefloating currency the government privatization program ended on schedule in   of gdp is now produced by the private sector and foreign owners control  of financial institutions  of industry  of telecommunications and  of the trading sector kőröshegy viaduct after hungarys gdp declined about  from  to  and grew only – up to  strong export performance has propelled gdp growth to  in  with other macroeconomic indicators similarly improving these successes allowed the government to concentrate in  and  on major structural reforms such as the implementation of a fully funded pension system partly modelled after chiles pension system with major modifications reform of higher education and the creation of a national treasury remaining economic challenges include reducing fiscal deficits and inflation maintaining stable external balances and completing structural reforms of the tax system health care and local government financing recently the overriding goal of hungarian economic policy has been to prepare the country for entry into the european union which it joined in late  prior to the change of regime in   of hungarys trade was with comecon countries by the end of  hungary had shifted much of its trade to the west trade with eu countries and the oecd now comprises over  and  of the total respectively

former soviet union of this about  billion came from american companies foreign capital is attracted by skilled and relatively inexpensive labor tax incentives modern infrastructure and a good telecommunications system by  hungary’s economic outlook had deteriorated wage growth had kept up with other nations in the region however this growth has largely been driven by increased government spending this has resulted in the budget deficit ballooning to over  of gdp and inflation rates predicted to exceed  this prompted nouriel roubini a white house economist in the clinton administration to state that hungary is an accident waiting to happen privatization in hungaryedit in january  the state privatization agency spa állami vagyonügynökség was established to manage the first steps of privatization because of hungarys  billion foreign debt the government decided to sell state property instead of distributing it to the people for free the spa was attacked by populist groups because several companies management had the right to find buyers and discuss sale terms with them thus stealing the company another reason for discontent was that the state offered large tax subsidies and environmental investments which sometimes cost more than the selling price of the company along with the acquisition of companies foreign investors launched many greenfield investments the centerright hungarian democratic forum government of – decided to demolish agricultural cooperatives by splitting them up and giving machinery and land to their former members the government also introduced a recompensation law which offered vouchers to people who had owned land before it was nationalized in  these people or their descendants could exchange their vouchers for land previously owned by agricultural cooperatives who were forced to give up some of their land for this purpose small stores and retail businesses were privatized between  and  however greenfield investments by foreign retail companies like tesco cora and ikea had a much bigger economic impact many public utilities including the national telecommunications company matáv the national oil and gas conglomerate mol group and electricity supply and production companies were privatized as well though most banks were sold to foreign investors the largest bank national savings bank otp remained hungarianowned  of

edit gdp growth inflation and active population in hungary  gdp per capita in usd at  market prices in hungary  general government gross debt in hungary amongst other countries and the eu reaching  hungarys fiscal indices deteriorated foreign investment fell as well as judgement of foreign analysts on economic outlook due to high demand in import goods hungary also had a high trade deficit  and budget gap and it could not reach an agreement with the imf either after not having a minister of finance for more than a month prime minister gyula horn appointed lajos bokros as finance minister on  march  he introduced a string of austerity measures the bokros package on  march  which had the following key points onetime  devaluation of the forint introducing a constant sliding devaluation  additional customs duty on all goods except for energy sources limitation of growth of wages in the public sector simplified and accelerated privatization the package also included welfare cutbacks including abolition of free higher education and dental service reduced family allowances childcare benefits and maternity payments depending on income and wealth lowering subsidies of pharmaceuticals and raising retirement age these reforms not only increased investor confidence but they were also supported by the imf and the world bank however they were not welcome widely by the hungarians bokros broke the negative record of popularity  of the population wanted to see him in an important political position  and only  were convinced that the reforms would improve the countrys finances in a big way  in  the ministry of finance introduced a new pension system instead of the fully statebacked one private pension savings accounts were introduced which were  social security based and  funded in  prime minister ferenc gyurcsány was reelected on a platform promising economic “reform without austerity” however after the elections in april  the socialist coalition under gyurcsány unveiled a package of austerity measures which were designed to reduce the budget deficit to  of gdp by  because of the austerity program the economy of hungary slowed down in   financial crisisedit declining exports reduced domestic consumption and fixed asset accumulation hit hungary hard during the financial crisis of  making the country enter a severe recession of  one of the worst economic contractions in its history on  october  hungary reached an agreement with the imf and eu for a rescue package of us billion aiming to restore financial stability and investors confidence because of the uncertainty of the crisis banks gave less loans which led to a decrease in investment this along with priceawareness and fear of bankruptcy led to a fallback in consumption which then increased job losses and decreased consumption even further inflation did not rise significantly but real wages decreased the fact that the euro and the swiss franc are worth a lot more in forints than they were before affected a lot of people according to the daily telegraph statistics show that more than  percent of hungarian mortgages and car loans are denominated in foreign currencies after the election in  of the new fideszparty government of prime minister viktor orbán hungarian banks were forced to allow the conversion of foreigncurrency mortgages to the forint the new government also nationalised  billion of private pensionfund assets which could then be used to support the government debt position presentday hungarian economyedit the economy showed signs of recovery in  with decreasing tax rates and a moderate  percent gdp growth from november  to january  all three major credit rating agencies downgraded hungarian debt to a noninvestment speculative grade commonly called

although the definition of the roma identity is controversial qualitative studies prove that the roma employment rate decreased significantly following the fall of communism due to the tremendous

inequalities in the country – at least twothirds of the poorest  people in hungary are romas furthermore ethnic discrimination is outstandingly high  of romas experience discrimination when looking

economistswho dispute this point claiming that expenditure ran up to today’s critical amount from  during two leftwing government cycles along with joining the eu the country undertook the task of joining the eurozone as well therefore the maastricht criteria which forms the condition of joining the eurozone acts as an authoritative guideline to hungarian fiscal politics although there has been

government deficit has shown a drastic decline to   from   according to an mnb forecast however until  the deficit will by a small margin fall short of the  criterion another criterion that is found

results for free why should i pay for advertising your current customers may search for your business by name aiming it easy to find you in search results but customers youve yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldnt necessarily bring up your business in search results advertising next to relevant bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach what is the difference between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a

does my ad appear your ads could appear on the top or to the right of bing yahoo and msn search results and you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions times or days of the week and even demographics what determines my ad position bing ads is a payperclick ppc advertising system you bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads we auction those spaces you are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want so if you bid on the keyword shoe you will have to beat

with the terms that are searched relevance how your bid compares to other bids in the bing ads auction how strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked clickthrough rate the stronger you are in these areas the better your chances of winning the top ad position how to use bing ads how can i use bing ads to drive more people to my website here are some tips to get better results review your budget and bid strategy if your ad keeps pausing your budget limit may be set too low competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website expand your targeting both for location and for devices computer mobile and tablet make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business how can i keep my costs down while your first instinct may be to lower your budget first try lowering your maximum bids yes this could mean fewer customers visit your site but if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid that would lower your costperclick and help stretch your budget how do i know if bing ads is working view a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats ad clicks the number of times your ad
