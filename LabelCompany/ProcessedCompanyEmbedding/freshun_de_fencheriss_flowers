few months ago i said in one of my videos when i had  subscribers that i am going to hit k subscribers before the end of the year finally today another huge accomplishment has been ticked off i started xctv on the th of march because one of my best friends neofytosd told me that he was missing the old videos i decided to give youtube a second try and i came with a strategy called “consistency” and “quality” for the past  months i was and i am uploading videos every monday each video requires  hours of my day to edit and record now from my experience with facebook pages instagram and youtube the hardest social media platform to build a following base is by far youtube and the easiest is instagram why is youtube the hardest platform youtube is the hardest platform because only videos are allowed in able to produce a quality video you need a software and hardware equipment once you have the hardware and software then the difficult part begins you first need to find an interesting subject to talk to place the camera at the perfect place prepare your appearance be honest and unique and make people listen to you obviously there are a lot more things running behind the scenes and the most difficult part is to produce those videos weekly with new ideas and also accept the haters opinions find a reason to make people subscribe to your channel it’s stupid to ask from your audience to subscribe to your channel while you upload videos once a month conclusion i have more than  followers on facebook and more than  followers on instagram but you know what i am more proud of i am way more proud for my  subscribers on youtube the amount of time and effort i made to touch so many people is insane and nobody helped me or shoutout my channel i will continue producing more videos because youtube supports the creators and my audience supports me the most amazing feeling about youtube is when i get in touch with my audience and reply to their comments

youre slaying the cardiolifting and diet aspects🔹 remember  keep it at a healthy amount people i suggest taking some serious restdays 💪🏼😴 i take two active rest days a week🔹  ive learned from my own experience as well as many clients of mine such as caileefit samperez healthyrunner serrrrb more that you may not see all of your beautiful muscles and separation due to  water retention from inflammation therefore if youre lean enough around  usually depending on gender and bmi you should be able to see muscle separation in your legs when flexed so if you find yourself frustrated with those quads and hamstrings try taking a few days off working legs youll be amazed at what results will come in just a few days💁🏻 i hope this helps comment any other questions regarding fitness below

you really have to let go of the past you will have to see the relationship as a brand new page if things come up that actually take you back into feelings and emotions that you have dealt with recognize what you have learned from this experience was worth who you have become because of it  dont allow the relationship to take away who you are as a woman just because someone did you wrong doesnt mean there is something wrong with you you are beautiful in every way flaws and all  bringing up the past attacking him if you dont hear from him are you cheating why didnt call me will only bring back a cycle that repeats the story of how you end up here in the first place  dont seek revenge if you do what he did you are hurting yourself not him if youre going to stick it out it may come up but you cant bring up the same thing every dayand think your relationship is going to heal  dont drive yourself crazy about what is going on you have to believe that they relationship is fresh no fb stalking people him or the girls he messed with he has to check the females he has to cut it all off for you and make sure he is there for you  make sure he is making improvements and really there for you buying you things is cool but they are not things that show he has changed and moved forward from the cheating if someone has changed not every guy is the same but he can do things to bring you reassurance that you are the one he wants to be with if he honestly made a mistake its hard for men sometimes i am not siding with them i am just saying theyre a bit different however you do have to take the necessary steps to make the relationship work all  all make sure hes worth it if you put time and effort in a relationship and he is doing the same thing over and over then you may have to

well after my most severe relapse  years ago even a minimal amount of movement was extremely difficult and exhausting i did  weeks of intensive physical therapy to recover normal functions walking lifting my arm etc after that and from starting aip more energy and less pain i now have a good handle on my movement goals  i designed my personal program based on the wahls protocol drterrywahls which recommends four types of regular exercise  stretching 💆  balance 🤸‍♀️  strengthening 💪  cardiovascular 🏃‍♀️  i rotate types of exercise daily and keep track in my day planner my stretching days i do the stretches recommended in wahls and from my pt for balance i do yoga at home or go to a class youtube is a great source for free yoga videos for strength i go to barre class or do strength exercisesweights at home for cardio i go on walks or jogs usually with ruby she loves it i also use a tracker and try to meet the k stepday goal by remaining active even at work where i take a small walks at lunchtime everyone is different from my experience ive learned it takes time and experimentation to discover what makes you personally feel the best dont be afraid to seek assistance from professionals i still check in with my pt and do maintenance sessions currently  what types of movement have helped you 🏋️‍♀️🏊‍♀️🚴🏂🚶‍♀️💃  stephaniekayco  stephanieaip read more autoimmunepaleo media

of negative comments this is a hack i have literally been doing for  years i was so surprised that this is making such a big impression right now this hack has been around forever i do this with individuals doubles with knots without knots and also with full strips i cut into  pieces its honestly one of my favorite tricks and ive probably done it on hundreds of clients through the years and never once have i had someone say they got an eye infection etc etc if you are careful and you use proper hygiene that will not happen its definitely much easier to do for people that are used to touching their eyes like contact wearers in the  years ive been doing this i personally have never had a bad experience and i have sensitive eyes and i wear contacts having said that if it scares you or makes you feel uncomfortable dont do it it definitely takes practice and patience at first its not for everyone from my experience most of my clients have said that it actually feels more comfortable than putting a full strip on top guys if you have not done this before or practiced enough to do it properly dont knock it for the people that are interested in learning this trick do you

journey is a clear reflection of that some people manage to do it over night but for me a lot of issues come up when i first heard that the emotional part of the detox you go through when going raw i just didnt take it seriously but i can really tell you from my experience that it is fully real i know that i am not the only one struggling i was a silent instagram observer for two years before i even started liking and commenting images i just kept saving everything i found interesting and before i even decided a healthblogger myself but you see the thing is that i am far from perfect but every day i get forward and i have a lot of knowledge to share besides im a trained holistic health coach i want to help more people on their journey and contribute to well being of others ill be

i went on a mission trip to ntt with my fellow friends this trip changed my life  my perspective of life it reminded me that i was created by god to glorify his name to serve the needy to share the gospel from the beginning i knew that i was given a big destiny by god i knew that i was going to be a big star  that all started to happen  still is happening but i was so dragged by the fame  luxuries god has blessed me with that i forgot god is giving me all of this to glorify his name not my name god has blessed me so much especially during these past few months god gave me so many opportunities to be on tv radios magazines to be a speaker in big events to become an inspiration  to be famous but there were times where fame dragged me down i wanted more than just this i wanted to be a hollywood movie star starring in action movies working with famous stars that dream was stuck in my head ive always wanted to become a movie star there were moments where i just started searching for auditions here in jakarta but because auditions here are very limited i started searching for auditions in la there were so many opportunities for auditions in la that i persuaded my dad to go to la for a few weeks ditch school to audition i went that far because that dream became an obsession there were actually a few offers from movie directors asking if i want to star in a movie but my mom denied the offers she told me that i was not ready for that much fame after i went to my church retreat  this ntt trip i realized that god destined me to use all these blessings  fame for gods glory to bring more souls to heaven to help the needy to inspire this generation god also told me that my dream of being a movie star wasnt fake he told me that he wants me to be in a movie but only for gods glory he told me to go and serve him more in ntt i experienced revival of many people we hosted  retreats   rally so many people met god  were filled with the holy spirit all of my experience there made me fall in love with god all i want is to serve god  please him using every opportunity he gives me for his glory ❤️🙏🏻 read more chloepurnama media removed i posted my snapchat videos from

wanted to talk about for a while ✨ wow is the first word that came into my head when i saw this its all i can say emma ford mypaleskinblog i am in awe  truly inspired by you to write this today thank you for making such an emotional moving  real  minute film on online bullying  the effects it left on you ✨ i cant believe people sit behind the guise of a instagramtwitterfacebook handle  virtually shred someones self confidence to pieces over something that they dont find appealing i was in tears by the end of emmas movie  that too without realising it 😢 online bullyingharassment is never ok in any circumstance  i know that from personal experience being judged for something you love to do  having awful comments thrown at you  about you is not funny either i think the people who do this to others need to have a hard look in the mirror themselves  ask themselves why they need to make another feel so low to make them feel better in any way it is messed up on a level that i will never understand  i have no empathy for those people that do this to other people for any reason i think online bullies are disgusting  should be ashamed of themselves ✨ its not fair its not cool  its not the way anyones parents would want their children to grow up to be 😔 my advice to those girlsladies that dont feel like they fit into societys version of beautiful is this you are beautiful in every way shape  form dont let anyone tell you what you are what fits in  how you should look you dont look disgusting you look beautiful ✨ if you havent seen mypaleskinblog youlookdisgusting

zzzzzs happy slumbering to all christi heather thu jul   pdt  avatar you must still be confusing perfectionism or obsession with elitism here is a handy test to find out which is which  when you set your toothbrush into the holder and someone elses toothbrush is in your spot you would a fling all other toothbrushes into the sink wash them with soap and cleanse the holder with bleach to make sure nobody elses saliva germs have touched your brush b shrug and put yours back in the right spot c brush your teeth and only notice its the wrong brush after youve grinned into the mirror make believing youre a rabid skunk swallowing the tail of its victim d grab each member of your family or your roommates and demand to know by what right they have usurped your number one place in the toothbrush holder e what toothbrush holder   when in an elevator and you unexpectedly pass gas do would a laugh b get off on the next floor and run down the stairs c declare that it wasnt a fart  its the onions and broccoli you just had for lunch d excuse me i never fart e stand perfectly still and sniff the air mentally noting the rank of your flatus a ten rating is the worst smell you have ever laid nose hairs on a one rating is a fart the dog wouldnt even notice   when the time arrives for you to sign a check or other document in front of a bank teller you would a scribble it as usual any pen will do b concentrate on signing it identically to the signature thats on your bank card  wouldnt want the teller suspecting you had taken the card and were just forging c brandish your own pen simply because it doesnt have one of those stupid chains on it oh and because it writes nice d whip out the personalized ink stamp of your signature and the premium quality ink pad and in a flourish of looking down your nose while huffing at the teller stamp your check ask for a wet wipe to cleanse the stamp afterward e i dont have a chequing account   when driving in your car and searching for a parking spot you would a park on the crosswalk because its convenient and you deserve to be close to the entrance b put the car into park at the mall and wonder where the valet is c have your driver park the car for you having a chauffer ie the valet is c have your driver park the car for you having a chauffer is the only way to travel d car i take the bus man e you order from catalogues the parking lot frenzy is a personal pet peeve  check your score add up your points  a b c d e  a b c d e  a b c d e  a b c d e add up your score and see what it says  to  apathetic and carefree also out of it most of the time its a toss up you dont care about too much least of all the little things but those little things neither annoy you nor take up much thought space thats good you cant fit anything else in there  to  are you sure youre not a hippy  to  a wee bit off the wall arent you enjoy it  to  did you know that the toilets flush in a different direction in the southern hemisphere oh no something you did not know write it down for heavens sake it just might come up on a test some day psssst by the way you are pulling into the drive  thru on a road in nutville youre having obsessive compulsive disorder with a double side  order of perfectionism drive through and pick up your prescription please  or  writing this one is a distraction im playing chess and guess what check mate gotcha you big pig of an elitist oh but i forgot you want me to know youre better than i am so you advertize it  there thats all the creative juice i can part with on the nb tonight have to save a whole whonk of it

dont know if any one else has asked you this yet but how old are you or is it supposed to be ixnay to mention that sort of thing litter maybe admittedly when i write this late in the evening my posts tend to be screwy but i dont think i mistook elitism for perfectionism there is an extreme of elitism whether just in my mind or a real one that exists you tend to watch everything you write with an overly keen eye nervous at every turn that you are copying someone something okay now that weve beat that topic to death heather gardening really do you happen to know of any good combinations of flowers that keeps the color blooming all year preferably blue laugh i just got a project sprung on me and need some advice from people anybody jack did you get rained on in hawaii oh and welcome back  heres a good tip for all yous with big projects think baby steps later all avatar litter thu jul   pdt  hi all wb jack happy birthday arik i dont have time to be depressed because of my age  im too busy being depressed about everything else o or maybe o avatar  i think you are confusing perfectionism with elitism i see nothing wrong with perfectionism per se but elitism is a deliberate choice to set oneself above others  a very arrogant aspiration perfectionism on the other hand is something that we should all aspire to at least as far as is practicable i think that all of us here look for our writing to be the best that we can make it however perfectionism can be a hindrance as there always seems to be something that can be improved heather  take care and not overdo things huh how many hands do you have now all  looks like ill probably do the new website both with and without frames and give the choice on the welcome page should be too much extra as the basic artwork and stuff will be the same and i have plenty space thanks for the comments ciao for now litter allein alleinandersonhotmailcom httpwwwangelfirecomwaalleinanderson thu jul   pdt  arik happy birthday big huge birthday hug i would jump out of a cake and sing to you but the cake isuhgone burp grins rachel hugs for you allein jerry lee jerryleecliffhangercom thu jul   pdt  yo all litter first puzzles and riddles are nice but writing is forever no apologies necessary second i have exactly the same symptoms ill be working on a story only to have a better though no more worthy story pounce upon my synapses the only way i can function is to make little notes to myself then ill finish up the story im getting bored with and write on the new one until either another new story pops up or i get reinterested in the original one when i say bored with i dont mean to say that the story no longer interests me its just that i like to maintain a very high level of enthusiasm one of these days all of my stories will be done on the same day and some publisher is going to think im more prolific than shakespeare as far as elitism is concerned i think a little bit is healthy to seperate ourselves from the masses helps self esteem to a point if we have a low opinion of people in general and think of ourselves as just another one of them we will overcome nothing extend our horizins not at all and sell ourselves short at every turn this is not to say that more elitism than is absolutely necessary is a good idea to constantly look down on all others in the world creates the likes of hitler and napolean in summary we need a bit to deliver too much or too little and we implode take care all jerry lee arik nesisactcomcoil thu jul   pdt  thank you guys thank you a lot you know that ve kno each other for  years seems

and that it is a fantastic one for you welcome back jack your diving sounds like quite an experience i am so glad you had a good time it is great to have you back though i have to go to tulsa for a househunting trip next week there are so many choices there are at least half a dozen school systems to chose from plus parochial lutherian and christian academies to consider it almost makes me dizzy to think of it there is so much to do here in perryton in the meantime the hardest i think is cleaning up my house i have been trying for three days i have to get it ready to show by tomorrow on top of that i promised to write a friend of mine a  word article by the th but i will i do it one step at a time must run now happy writing rhoda heather thu jul   pdt  welcome back jack sounds as though the trip to hawaii was exhilarating happy birthday arik birthdays are only sad if you contemplate age too long sore wrists and fingers this morning so typing will be short i hear whooping and celebration gardening yesterday had to turn over all the garden bed soil it was so packed and hardened i think my hands might have fallen off digging had it not been for determination and tendons mulched and peat mossed until my head sprouted saw a worm that was so huge it was seriously larger around than my thumb no kidding ouch my hands really calloused up overnight to add to the ones i already had i should have turned the soil last year when we bought the house but there were so many other things to dofirst off to pamper my hands then ill be visiting chapter  since its lonely i am almost finished heather mary notdotcalmyahoocom thu jul   pdt  welcome home jack jack beslanwitch jackwebwitchcom thu jul   pdt  hello all just got back from hawaii several hours ago and a little tired after the long flight and pawing through a pile of email i will have more to say when i get up and have time to archive the notebook to a reasonable size again the diving was great got in  dives while there including ones where i got to swim with large turtles see manta rays do a ballet above me swim through lava caverns with openings above before and behind and coral covering everything do not have space enough to tell the accounts of all the fish seen i will note one though the garden eel which gets its name because it anchors itself in the sand and stands up like blades of grass or many many cobras doing a dance the music of the pipes when you float over them they subside into the sand being the shy creatures that they are the unique aspect about this is that hawaii is one of the few places where a recreational diver can see them since they normally are found at  feet here they can be found between  and greater we saw them at  feet which by the way was the deepest i have dived so far take care everyone and talk with you more when i have had sleep arik nesisactcomcoil thu jul   pdt  thanks mary  i guess its true mary wed jul   pdt  happy birthday to you happy birthday

when i get to a frames page i have to keep scrolling right and left to take in all the text etc dont mine them when i am on my big machine but that is getting more rare an occurance every day the old back keeps me in my recliner more and more i am limited to my desk chair to about an hour at a time now on the other hand frames are nice for quick navagation when the display isnt taken into consideration maybe just a small one on the right side with quick links and a reasonable text in the left larger frame would work never ran into a site like that be unique and make one never know might start a fad write on jerry heather wed jul   pdt  litter frames sound good to me but its true pages with them take longer to load something to consider also a nothought way to choose between several ideas is the old hat pick write the novel ideas on slips of paper and put them in a top hat alright a fedora will suffice and close your eyes  and ask someone else to pick one or you could just sit down and start writing the one that you want to write most urgently dont worry too much about whether it will be marketable with one book ready for publication and soon to be marketed you have more than your foot in the door youve got your body into the room rachel  its bbq season man i am running out of sunblock  hee hee and my privacy fence has been completed well i was going to say something  possibly on that blacktongued elitism topic yeah that was it but the thoughts have scattered really its time to get back to the real reason im on the computer email kidding heather avatar firewingshotmailcom wed jul   pdt  litter im going to keep the discussion going i really am i have to say that unfortunately some people could indeed destroy their goals and their talents for elitisms sake i have been to that extreme and back again what if someone else has already thought of this idea what if its not original enough people who aspire to be great writers can indeed fall onto their proverbial petards the idea that someone else has already had that idea already drives one to perfection and ultimately to ruin it is entirely possible to destroy all talent you have ever had all for one fear that of losing originality rhoda im glad to hear that angie is doing well and sorry to say that i missed out on the praying ill make it up when she goes through chemo laura lucky you i wish i had your problem mine is similar to litters only when i go to write any of them down the logical side of my brain takes over and boom or and this is similar to yours i get em but decide i have something i need to do more talk about blowing yourself out of the water before setting sail hallee i once read in a magazine about two women mother and daughter the latter who had both breasts removed to prevent cancer there the former who died from it i believe she didnt get false breasts to live like she used to she stayed the way she was after surgery some women get false breasts for very good reasons others just like getting more stares food for thought later all avatar ps arik that was good what inspired it mary notdotcalmyahoocom wed jul   pdt  i personally love framesi think

look at the einstein puzzle but i always get sidetracked i still owe mary a poem too where does the time go rhoda  good news about angies surgery going well also i agree that much massmarket fictions sucks  but its what the masses want or at least are told that they want having said that i have to agree with amerigo who me yes me that writers should aspire to be the best they can be  it goes without saying well i think it does… avatar the persona of a god that feels like a small child… hmmm  i think that a person can be too elitist but fortunately i dont think many actually are it also seems to me that those who attempt to be elitist or pass themselves of as one of the elite are hoist on their own petards and fail miserably that is not to say that those who aspire to be greatinfluentialrespected writers for example fall into the same category  aiming to be the best or one of the best is a perfectly laudable goal but aiming to join an elite for elitisms sake is the stuff of sycophantic sterility a short time ago we had some discussion of what to do when writers block sets in  i suffer from the opposite  too many ideas and not enough direction difficulty in choosing which storyline of many to follow anyone else plagued with this it gets even worse when there are several hot ideas in totally different genres  you know one will sell but perhaps another will provide more of a challenge  what do you choose  back to work ciao for now litter rachel wed jul   pdt  garies  a hug like that in a public place oh my oh dear grins its nice to see you back on

weeds at the bottom of the structure she is probably still shuffling in the overgrowth searching on hands and knees for her selfesteem ironic i made up the jello part i cant imagine how friekish two

off to provide a lovely cool front angie did fine with her surgery i told her that many of you all were praying and thinking about her and she was very moved to know it she is a bit sore and has to wait until she has healed before she can begin chemo elitism i do not rightly know how to define it but i know it when i see it and to be quite frank i dont recognize it among any of you you see some of it at writers conferences but it is not generally among the more successful writers i think what does rile me is these occassional people you hear in seminars and at the lunch table who tell you such things books are getting sexier unless you respond to that market trend you will never break in or blond heros just wont cut it anymore women think blond guys are insipid or the heronine can never be pregnant with a baby who is not the heros or you will never sell a book these days that takes place in the middle east one hears so many thou shalts and thou shalt nots in publishing circles at the same time editors tell you how open minded they are and how they are looking for something different and fresh i think i understand partly americos argument i too am beginning to despise mass market fiction and partly because it is so repetitious writers write to please the editors and the marketing departments rather than write to please themselves and their readership if you dont believe me ask a few authors on contract theyll admit it oh well it is this crazy headache and my sinus infection that puts me on my soap box today my outlook on life will improve when my head finally clears without adultery twothirds of our novelists would stand in line for unemployment checks peter prescott that quote is for you americo take care all rhoda avatar firewingshotmailcom tue jul   pdt  oh what i wouldnt give for another  years to my life right now being young has its advantages but when youre reading posts that have been very complex latelyouch all i have to tell you reading some of these namely americo litter howard etc makes me feel like a small child and now im going to raise my hand a little hesitantly bite the bullet choke down some of my rising lunch and ask all three of you can a person become too elitist if there is an extreme for generalization then there should be one for elitism as humanity is always fair when the complexity of the opposing sides could kill you btw this is not me opening the floor for more warring of the words this is just me being curious of course that could be fatal too look what happened to the cat americo did you get enough stories for publishing strawberries and the moon and whatever happened to the shadows project tina you do not know how very appreciative i am that someone has answered my question if this notebook is like a

maine four days gs litter tue jul   pdt  reactions and reservations amerigo  you may have to return to sender as you wish as the elitist mail was in direct response to a line of discussion posted on the notebook and one that used that very word  elitism the post is not addressed specifically as it was not intended specifically it was meant as a selfsearching exercise for anyone whose conscience was pricked by anything that i said within the post i have been subject toembroiled within elitism in many different guises and have found the elitists are those with something to prove to themselves but without the wherewithal with which to prove it elitism disparages the efforts and talents of others  my personal view on elitism  i despise it and everything it stands for my experience in the main is that those who genuinely excel in their chosen field whether it be literature music art commerce relationships or any field not yet mentioned tend not to hold elitist views elitism poisons embryonic and struggling talent it is counterproductive and has no place in my worldview if anyone feels that they are a part of the neonaziliterati then they probably are if they feel that they are not then they probably arent then again there are the trolls… trolls are those who whip up discussion with the pretence of belonging to the ranks of the nnl or elitists of another stripe we are all capable of this to some degree or other amerigo have you been trollish have i been trollish questions questions  perhaps there are answers forming as i speak seek ye all the bastard bastions of neonaziliterati and burn them on the high alter of ignorance and affectation i conclude with the sentiments of rabbie burns to whom i wish i could hold a candle  a mans a man for a that ladies this is a generic term that also means a womans a woman for a that but probably not a mans a woman for a that or a womans a man for a that… o litter hallee halleecaolcom tue jul   pdt  morning all today i am submitting my trilogy to an agent who asked for it and also to a publisher just to save time while the agent contemplates it and decides to tell me something like you write well but tina thank you  no greater compliment could a romance writer wish for christi welcome back andits fun to be sappy on occsation   teekay many sports i too find to be boring unless of course its american football  nothing boring about that at all however just to flip through the channels and pause to watch men in the finest physical shape possible run around a court or a field and do their thing  that cannot be boring well unless youre a man  but they do have those victorias secret commercials now  okay all now im off to write my query letter i almost wish i had some more editing to do maybe maybe maybe i can get

new resume utilizing frustration as my kindling not frustration with my wordprocessor no  frustration with my present job my first draft for the cover letter is also my final copy if only my novel would press onto the page so easily the resume will have to wait for printing until tomorrow i have to peel apart my filing cabinet for some long lost information first and before the landslide of paper hits me like so many encyclopedias i must get some rest fare thee well christi so good to hear from you cant wait to see more of your posts i forgot to say that earlier forgive me oh and i did get some real writing done today on my novel thank god the block has been flushed it had plagued me again for days heather gariess tue jul   pdt  by the way i dont know if anyone here has heard from sass but word is he let himself be seen again it was on the news hes got to be more careful than that if he is to preserve the mystery and the challenge of catching out the old big foot and for that matter not getting a load of birdshot in his furry butt would be a respectable agenda in itself you dont know what some of these fanatics are like gs gariess tue jul   pdt  heather sweet heather i am so glad to have run into you actually i dont think there is a derry maine king used the derry name of the town in new hampshire for his story from derry so i am told i dont know if this really works it is said he used the locale of the city of keene new hampshire for a story he renamed a fictional town in new hampshire i believe that was it i think they use all these contortions just to throw the bloodhounds among the readers off i dont guarantee any theory on kings locales still if he says its boulder colorado it is boulder colorado kissy kissy gs heather mon jul   pdt  gariess i was hoping for your return dont stay in the wilds too long but do pop in and visit sasquatch while youre off romping with the lampshades and petrol cans and while in maine go to derry im sure youll meet up with king remember to check the sewer grates for clowns spiders little boys and newspaper boats if you see any dont tug the grate and dont hide under a lampshade the clowns are on to that one oh and if you pass by a shop called needful things you dont need any cheerio and ta ta all of that smatter bubye im going off to write my eyeballs out remind me not to gouge or cackle heather whoops a few fragments

something to think about and remember no sentence fragments gs gariess mon jul   pdt  i think i better get moving on that trip to the woods this place really needs a lampshade ah well i know what its like to get into a flame war in the nb jerry it is interesting to hear how other places celebrate the th a rodeo is a cool idea here we have the boston pops which throws a big party on the banks of the charles river the grounds are opened at am on the morning of the th and the people swarm in to establish territory no chairs allowed only blankets imagine waiting  hours for the band to strike up but what a band this year  people saw the show and the fireworks on the charles i have only ever watched it on tv but when the pops plays the first bars of the stars and stripes and half a million people jump up and start to shout and dance i always choke up like a schoolgirl its a geat moment to be a sousa wouldnt you say americo silly me for americo it is always a great moment to be a sousa why have it any other way proudly gs jerry ag ericsson mon jul   pdt  gezz a guy takes a few days off from the notebook and all sorts of interesting events take place well no sense in jumping in the midst of it all as most of you know the th of july is our time to celebrate our independance here in south dakota this is done in a wonderful way not only do we have our fireworks display we rodeo spent the past three days in celebration with rodeos every day intermixed with plays dances and all that goes with them of course i didnt dance cant do things like that anymore i did however enjoy the music floating past my house from the huge tent which takes up an entire one block section of our main street lots of food and great reunions with old friends along with meeting new ones somehow it makes a person feel young again if only for a short time ah well its all over for another year and after a few days recoperation i will be back to normal and maybe writing a few stories based on the insperation of this last week write on jerry americo agsousaesotericapt mon jul   pdt  ive just had a look at the posts since my latest one july  ill wait till jack comes back and give us a tabula rasa to reply to the most interesting ones but there is one which must be remedied right away the name of its author is litter and litter with his celtic straightforwardness and gallantry will kindly explain to us what he means by the following passage coming in the aftermath of a change of opinions between howard and i here is litter on elitism   the sin i was accused of and the topic of the day elitism rears is ugly portswilling cigarsmoking cuban only rolled on the thighs of a virgin hautecouture nouvellecuisine fengshui wooden not veneered head who is to say what are the entrance qualifications to the bastard bastions of the neonaziliterati  litter july  litter before that post you said here that you were feeling like writing  a satirical review of presidential erections and life in the oral orifice ahhhhhhhh none of the people who get so justly irritated and protest so rightly and vehemently because i defend the artistic integrity of a writer and consider death punishment immoral raised their voices against such a proof of good taste typical but ill do it for the happy silent majority wonderful project litter it shows you aint no elitist man and how beautifully said bravo now that i have done justice to your genius and clean taste i feel entitled to ask you a little favour please tell us who you have in mind when you mention the neonaziliterati id like to know who and where they are so that we can call the nuremberg court again those people deserve a lesson i hate them i honestly do i have been the loudest democrat on this page and i had no idea that we still had such criminals since martin was kicked off i am totally with you on that man unless your neonaziliterati are just the elitists you condemned in that case well litter sorry but you aint right there and my brother you committed a sin you offended an honest person who did you no harm and moreover who was is and will be so obviously right that even a seegull can see it one two if jon was included three since pussy has just awaken ill leave the bastard bastions of your marvelous post for another time or perhaps ill put it in the same return to the sender packet if you send yours by first class mail  another topic promising to be quick just a post scriptum actually i know what the gang on reaction means and i am only sincerely sorry for howard a good man and a worthy notebooker for having such a kind of support but he does not need my help and ill leave it to him to put things in order im curious to see how he will do it gariess mon jul   pdt  so you missed me greatly did you lucky for me your aim is so bad i have to take a minute here to hug rachel it doesnt really take a minute i just said that okay thats enough hugging any longer and i wont have to go to forest to find wood the last time i dropped in here somebody had posted something about tits why would i think of that now i was wondering if we have a scribe here who is a little obsessive on the subject anyway whenever i think about tits i get all caught up in my thoughts and forget whatever it is i am doing thats why i didnt post anything that last time in fact i am forcing myself to write this without thinking i can do that okay several minutes have passed since i wrote that last line i wish i could remember what i was going to say well it was probably a lie anyway oh i know what it was the lampshade yes the lampshade i am going back to the woods to get the lampshade out of the porsche i will bring it back to the nb so we can have a lampshade to wear again when we want to be silly if anyone wants to bring back the porsche they will have to get gas hayden always put petrol in it but i think it will run better on gas i will now watch an episode of freinds on the tv that should help to get my mind off tits i really love all you guys but i hate getting sappy so dont expect me to repeat that just remember it and dont tell anybody i said it what is petrol anyway probably kangaroo piss later gs christi mon jul   pdt  hello all i am so glad to be back sandys memorial was on friday and it was an experience to be had we celebrated her life and what a life it was i feel lifted i feel like i might be able to write again too my heart survived having been mended back together with the help of many generous fellow humans who gave love and support during a time of great trial i think that by the end of ones life their heart has been broken and mended so many times that it resembles a patchwork quilt but the thread is made of the purest gold and each patch represents new triumphs new friends and renewed faith sap sap sap i am sooo sappy lately  anyway love and stuff to you all for your prayers positive vibes and your humor teekay hi and thanks aw shucks who are you oh anonymous poster of july th be you garriess a person we miss greatly or be you the legendary hayden a person ive not yet had the pleasure of meeting come out and tell us more of your wanderings of our fair notebook i for one am intrigued with all the posting of late i still havent a clue as to whos in charge of our government now i stayed inside during the overthrowing thingie and as far as im concerned im still christi your minister of love affairs xoxoxo heather mon jul   pdt  teekay i find distancing myself from my ms the hard part im so entwined in my novel through personal experience etc that i must remind myself often to take a step back and analyze carefully it is rather like taking the straight and narrow path yet it winds and slopes is covered in slippery mosses and tangled vines there are hidden pitfalls ever at random intervals and im barefoot but im not defenseless ive got all of my senses and some logic handy perhaps there is some way to bring your emotions closer to your writing see yourself reflected in the characters the protagonist at the very least imagine you are slipping into their actual shoes at this very moment is this novel about something that you have not personally experienced that might be the primary reason you feel you arent completely submerged in your work besides the obvious aspect of the mechanical all i know is that if i werent totally immersed in the story it wouldnt be my best work if you feel that it might be boring then you may want to evaluate whether or not you are bringing everything to the page if you are emotionally distanced there is also another factor to consider are you too close to the subject matter big tidy hugs and vicious grins heather mary notdotcalmyahoocom mon jul   pdt  teekay good to see you this morning i do stand on a tennis court occasionallylobbing and backhanding towards my husband dont worry thoughyou wont have to watch me anytime soon i stink however i cant find a single boring thing about rafter i could watch him lose for hours good day all teekay mon jul   pdt  hi all rhoda back already that was quick mary i dont watch any sport on tv i find it incredibly boring at least i imagine i would for i have never tried nor felt the inclination to why do you ask do you play id watch it if you played christi where are you i hope all is okay with you am missing your prescence dear howard im glad to hear molly will be okay and be getting that ba as well okay now for my futurebest selling novel update i have religiously written    pages everynight i have found that when im writing i dont get very emotionally involved with it its like being a spectator and sort of reeling it off i dont know if thats because its extrememly dull which i suspect it may be or if thats a common thing i do however tend to lose myself when im reading a good book and i do lose myself when i am writing but more on a superficial level make sense i dont know anyway im doing it and im determined to see it through heaps more id like to rave on about but someones gotta cook the dinner heather sun jul   pdt   words in the english language give or take three and only seven of that number are taboo which seven and why are they still taboo if you guess them perhaps they arent as viciously scorned as they once were pardon me but i thought i smelled the earthy smoke of a cuban recently lit my thigh is forlornly naked of brown paper o sun jul   pdt  well i was lost in the forest you see if you have ever been lost in the forest you know how scary it can be even for a little while i walked for some time looking for a way out of the woods and at last i heard a rumble in the background it took a long time but i walked through some of the dense undergrowth and when i parted the leaves in front of me i saw a large clearing the ground was trampled it appeared to be the scene of some recent disturbance or such on a tree was a hastily written warning on an unfolded cardboard carton that declared the area out of bounds to elitists and crapwriters i wasnt sure i knew what these things were but i didnt think it mattered if i was one of them or not since there was no one about on other trees were messages in different hands they were about different things somehow port swilling and the thighs of virgins come to mind and there were less provoking issues raised such as ganging up on people for one thing or another i have always been partial to port swilling myself and would have been glad to get to a place where i could do some i am also partial to the thighs of virgins although i must explain that i have never been able to tell a virgin thigh from any other things like that are best taken on faith i suppose and best contemplated when one is safely out of the forest cigars i never liked whomevers thighs they were rolled on after reading a few of these writings i could see that this was no place for me at this point i was more in need of finding a course to follow than to satisfy my curiosity about the origin and the aim of these writings after a long time i observed what seemed to be old tire tracks leading away from the clearing they were very faded but they offered the only possibility i could see to finding a way out of the forest so i followed them i followed them for the longest time they finally ended in a thicket where there was a rusting old sports car i looked inside and saw the most peculiar thing on the front seat a shabby old lampshade very strange indeed i found a road soon after that and eventually came to familiar surroundings i thought about the clearing in the woods many times since that day i also thought about the signs on the trees and that old car with the lampshade but for the life of me no explanation comes to mind rachel sun jul   pdt  all  smiles and hugs all around rhoda sun jul   pdt  to be honest americo is not the only person here who is provocative on occasion to say that really isnt fair so i must correct my mistake anyone can provoke debate given the right circumstances rhoda rfortarnnet sun jul   pdt  what have i missed a brawl and i wasnt even a part of it i hope all is settled and we are all friends again rachel please try not to take it all so much to heart i read through the posts and did not find them so terrible howard and americo have strong feelings and i respect both men because of that people with conviction will get a little rowdy at times family members scrape with one another sometimes people on the notebook do the same americo says some very provocative things many which to engender strong emotion i think the balance here involves being free to express ones heartfelt opinions and still remain respectful to the person one disagrees with those are my observations for all they are worth nice to not be in the hot seat this time rhoda howard htuckeystnyrrcom sun jul   pdt  americo  im sorry if i offended with the a  there was no offense intended and i do appreciate where youre coming from perhaps elitist was not the right choice in words but for a moment there i recalled similar words from a professor who used to trash students writing then the students themselves right in front of the class and i reacted as i did to her i guess thats why i only got a b in her class rachel  i consider americo a friend also so i was honest in my disagreement with him no more no less i dont think i trashed anyones taste in literature nor did he americo is sincere in his desire to encourage excellence in the craft of writing so am i we express it in different ways so be it mark  nice pattern in contrast i agree with you on the second stanza but can we say similied i guess we can though it shocks at first another ecquaintance coined let a simile be like your umbrella philip cohen i like that sisyphus  perhaps that rock belongs in the foundation and not the parapet all  rachel is right  lets not be ganging up on anyone we dont need mob mentality egging us on to words that we wouldnt otherwise write one goldring was enough howard mary notdotcalmyahoocom sun jul   pdt  rachel i am not sorry for voicing my support of comments made by other people and you must admit at least partially that americo can go a little overboard i do however agree that it seems like all we have done lately is argue well not all but a lot your loyalty is beyond reproachoh to have a friend such as you americo no mudslinging from me just controlled nods and mutterings along with being one of the most frustratingly stubborn people on the planet you are also one of the most insightful and intelligent i respect you for that despite our incompatibilities you are indeed entitled to your opinions heather hi hope all is well with you teekay do you ever watch tennis australia sure does turn out some hot looking tennis players everybody else adieu rachel sun jul   pdt  all  why is it that every time americo opens his mouth to share an opinion people seem to jump down his throat and take offense he is only sharing a view for this he is accused of everything i am seeing some pretty ugly words tossed around this site right now i dont see why people are so quick to take things personally okay i know that if you have been on this site for a long time you would know that i have taken things personally once or twice i guess what im saying is that i dont like the way that folks here seem to pack attack what do i mean by that i mean that one person will say something and then all the others will chime in with yah yah that is just what i was thinking uh hu me too i have made no secret that i view americo as a friend i know he doesnt need me to stick up for him but this is just something that really does bother me the man is not into elitism i also dont like common crap writing does that make me an elitist does the fact that i find it difficult to respect the work of a person who mimics others make me an elitist mary  i know i know im doing what i said not to do again im a gal who is full of contradictions howard  i dont think you would shoot a person not unless your very life or the life of one you loved depended on it then again in the situation and given the ability to defend self who wouldnt kill an attacker i know i would americo  i dont think howard would shoot a person for the love of a dog i am so frustrated with all of this it seems that each time i turn around there is one nasty conversation after another going on in here tina  i also am not a maniac although if you read this post of mine you might think i am i hope i can get up for some camping in your area this summer if i do we should get together it would be fun we do knife fighting in my dojo i always have fun when we have a knife day allein  thank you for getting back to me so quickly smiles this is far from my usual post it is just that i am so tired of all of this i cant stand the way that people natter on at one another we all think differently and there is nothing wrong with that i guess if we didnt disagree and go back and forth it wouldnt be a very interesting place there just has to be a way that people here can talk to each other and skip the name callingmud slinging stuff i happen to love the literature that i saw being bashed on this page dont trash an author and their works just because you feel that they wrote a literary piece and you happen to be angry with americo now i think that i have said more than enough for one day take care all rachel mark sun jul   pdt  litter wrote flotsam and jetsam betrothed in a

a blisteringly good sunday to you all  except that is for all those for whom it is now monday elitism rears is ugly portswilling cigarsmoking cuban only rolled on the thighs of a virgin hautecouture nouvellecuisine fengshui wooden not veneered head who is to say what are the entrance qualifications to the bastard bastions of the neonaziliterati tell me do i want to join and be famous for being famous for talking bollocks bullocks bollocks that is  taken after noble death in the bullring not as a byproduct of common butchery in an abattoir much as it does sound french and impressive… personally i can only bear to read fiction if it is written entirely in hyeroglyphics although i do sometimes indulge in the common underbelly of the classical greek but that is between thee and me and not for repetition in the vulgar pages of irrelevance where was i oh yes science fiction researching quantum mechanics and astrophysics to get a handle on what cannot be at this moment but that may be at some time in the future if you of course accept the notion that time is linear and forwardly progressive and not as we of course are all aware a mere part of a grand unified theory of everything  are there any left that are so naďve and gullible so what that much of what is theorised and written about now transmutes from scifi to scifact in the future  scifi is all things considered a waste of paper or electrons for epublishing and a debased heresy of the high art of literature… strangely as it may seem i dont think so now as howrad would say  back on your heads litter flotsam and jetsam betrothed in a divine marriage of bottom burps and halitosis mary notdotcalmyahoocom sun jul   pdt  howard atta boy everyone good sunday hope everyone enjoys their day went to waldens yesterday and saw chicken soup for the writers soul just wanted to let everyone know it is out there because i had no idea in the immortal words of jack nicholson playing the joker in batman cant we all just get along now there is some fine dialogue smiles to all hallee halleecaolcom sun jul   pdt  americo the reason i believe that howard said you have and underlying tone of elitism is because you said that great literature is the only one that deserves to be written and respected i have been trying to form a response to that since i read it but i believe howard did such a good job that i will leave it alone and yet you have in a sense retracted that statement you yourself admitted to reading a thriller or a scifi on a lazy day personally i dont enjoy reading great literature it bores me to tears just as i dont enjoy watching what society deems great films as ive said before i prefer entertainment i will take a good bond movie over snow falling on cedars any day of the week and prefer my romances and thrillers over hawthorne and poe im certain that you feel that places you above me in many aspects and if you do so be it and why was i given life as a christian i know the answer to that question as well as the others that followed its simple really and very clear hallee americo agsousaesotericapt sun jul   pdt  okay howard you can call me a like jon ill call you howard though a mere question of style now i just want to make this clear what you and other people call my underlying tone of elitism does not make sense to me what separates us is not a different attitude towards what we read i may also enjoy reading on a day of leisure and laziness a good thriller a good science fiction book etc  and i have defended all genres on this page more than anyone else what i insist on is that each author must try to write hisher books in an original and artistic way and not just limit himselfherself to copy what has already been done what separates us is a different attitude towards writing a writer must strive for the best and not be content with the mediocre or even the average if one does not feel able to write the best in the genre of hisher choice that person is on the wrong path because writing is not a job like any other job writing is a vocation the only means some people find to explain the apparent absurd of their existence or to express hopefully for ever the immense joy of having had a chance to experience this silly adventure on earth what separates us howard is a different worldview and a different concept of destiny what you call my elitism is merely my wish to express myself in the best way i can the best way to answer this little set of questions why was i given life why this anguish why this bliss what can i do with the humble skills i have and this attempt at answering  i must use my skills in the best possible way i cannot just aim at the easy at the fashionable at what the others have already done i have to find my true voice and give it its unique expression that is what writing means howard and that is what i have been preaching here for a year and a half but this notebook is like the myth of sisyphus  you are condemned to start again and again not very different from a writers plight heather sun jul   pdt  with thundering glee i commend you howard americo weirdness tinges every artists soul but to what degree the tinge and with what notion do we defend our writerly weirdness overlooking any other brand the real question is how these tinges are developed one slight pinkness on an otherwise blue and green pallette can be enlarged and everything holds pink surprise ignore the little tinge of pink and it is overrun by the sheer strength of the others see the pink and celebrate take it up and spread it focus your lens on the diminutive shadow top left in your view dappling the shoulder of your subject now anyone can aim and snap the shutter it is the focus the emphasis with which we apply our attention our efforts our fine eye that sees the shadow at all weirdness there arent any averages left i dont think so many ways to express ourselves or not if you sniff the air and take a wideanglelook at the crowd ill bet not a one will fall into the average category if only upon a careful second look we cannot know what lies dormant in the heart we can only measure it by words and actions and token clues yet where is the sliderule that designates a value for average or normal or weirdness for that matter a moot question now i remind myself that im perceived as weird all the time i can feel it in the bend of others gazes the shifting way their feet move and the blank faces devoid of comprehension no matter i mutter no matter geniuses and idiots alike are allowed their weirdnesses i do not claim to be either but ill take my weirdness whatever it is and whenever it sparks and ride the flames as far as they may take me you know what i dont care if i make sense to anyone else any more i make sense to me heather yawn howard htuckeystnyrrcom sat jul   pdt  a  i think perhaps that were saying the same thing after all now that you put it that way at least i think thats what i said in the last sentence of my previous post making that retelling interesting doing it in a way that captivates the reader and makes him want to continue  thats the difficult part of the writers craft but there is that underlying tone of elitism that seems to sneer at writing that is not true literature and that is what i protest yes i thoroughly enjoyed camus the stranger hemingways islands in the stream faulkner ibsen tolstoy melville poe  all of the above no argument there but i also enjoy the work of ian fleming sterling lanier alan dean foster zane grey burroughs kline theodor geisel  and others who may not be recognised by the literati but who still hold my interest because they write well on the things about which i enjoy reading there was only one cs lewis one browning one shakespeare okay there were two brownings they and others created works that live on after them to entertain and inspire those works are uniquely theirs but who is to say that they are any better than lengle rice henderson or card they did not invent the talent with which they were blessed but they did use and develop it to the best of their ability and that is what we strive toward here  those unique persons we know as rachel tina jerry teekay rhoda heather and the rest of ussome weirder than others to be sure are here to encourage one another to try develop and use the talent weve been given whether it be science fiction poetry short story romance mystery or haiku as i said perhaps we are saying the same thing as for your contention that had i been able to get hold of a gun i would have killed the man who ran over molly  no i think not theres no satisfaction to be had in that and if he had shot her i would have taken the gun from him and broken it then him but not shot him  that would be much less effective and much too common mark sat jul   pdt  new piece on poetry page i included a bit of my own editing and the rationale i really believe in the notion of critical thinking ie make assessment of things we see rather than take reality at face value but we all need some feedback and we all need some value system to fall back on or critical thinking invents new meaning each time the alarm goes off thinking is like sex dont do it alone tina sat jul   pdt  hello howard you seem to me a very sensible compassionate person i draw this conclusion by the thoughts you express the actions you describe the clarity of your writen voice draw a gun on that idiot no anger is not the same as stupidity and even if a weapon had been placed in your hands i think you have the intelligence to handle the situation i just wanted you to know that ive yet to see any evidence that anyone here cannot express their views ive yet to see any evidence that anyone here stands on the pinacle of the best veiws ive yet to see any evidence that anyone anywhere is the sole voice of the best views i do see evidence here that the experiences of life are being embraced and belief systems have formed in accordance with those experiences moderated by tolerance i do see evidence of a beautiful array of beliefs intelligence and viewpoints as bright and varied as an alpine field of wildflowers whos to say which flower is the most ideal a domestic rose would never survive that environment and wild paintbrush disdains a garden does that elevate the dandelion to be the best avatar sometimes at those times i cancel any other plans  if possible  and write all day hunger becomes incidental discomfort is inconsequential those times are far more important than the daily drudgery of chores and minor commitments if i cant delay those responsibilities i ask my muse to hold the thought and pray she listens off to write or edit or both tj americo agsousaesotericapt sat jul   pdt  howard im jons secretary today we discussed this matter in january and february last year remember i agree with you and so does jon  at least he never said anything to the contrary that practically all subjects have been dealt with we both agree with you we never said anything to the contrary that was not the point anyway now why dont you agree with jon that a writer must deal with them in an original way he said that any book must be new and written in a new way and this is only what he said stories may be old but a new writer must tell it in a new way those old books of yours say nothing to the contrary actually the old books you referred to were very original in style and contents and great literature when they were first produced its because they were original that they were so good and they were so good that despite having scandalized many people at the time for some people they are still masterpieces today thus must be all good literature and forever literature is a specialized craft and a very demanding art its also the expression of the uniqueness of a creative soul what jon says is so easy to understand all the great american writers i know wrote and are still writing according to jons principles if i may say so melville and poe and hawthorn and fitzgeral and faulkner and hemingway did it even your latest nobel prize toni morrison is trying to do it i am speaking about great literature its the only one that deserves to be written and respected this is a forum where some young people are trying to write and learn the job its very important that they know what they must try to do and avoid like the plague the massified industry which is sometimes pointed out here as good literature i was horrified when some time ago i saw what people were reading i remember only a decent book from the lists that were offered here as good literature it was called létranger the stranger by alber camus you mentioned it i cannot of course know everything and read everything and very likely other good books were also mentioned i only remember that one and i also remember that once last year a chap who pretended to also be a writer said that shakespeare was rubbish  and i was the only one here to protest death penalty was defended here some time ago and i was the only one to protest gun carrying forbidden last month in brazil at last is almost taboo to discuss here because everybody here seems to be in favour of that blatant stupidity youd probably have killed the chap that overran molly with his car if you had a gun in your hands or at least molly would have been shot if that beast  im referring to the car owner not to molly  had a gun handy and however a writer cannot express here without causing trouble views that are obviously the best and they are the best because they are the most rational and the ones that the most civilized societies have adopted the same in regard to literature what kind of place is this people protest whenever a decent opinion is expressed people shut up when the usual monstrosities are expressed very weird place really i like it its fun mainly when jon goes on his great adventures now lets see what comes next avatar sat jul   pdt  just dropping a line in did anyone here see bicentennial man yet its a new movie out with robin williams in it based on a book coauthored by isaac asimov called the positronic man it is a very sad moving movie and i have a feeling the book is the same anyone read it all when as you write does the writing itself begin to grab hold you to your chair and glue you to the page later avatar howard htuckeystnyrrcom sat jul   pdt  jon  i wouldnt expect you to remember it because its written in a very old book but the wisest man who ever lived so lots of people  some of them very original thinkers  say observed that there is nothing new under the sun and all is vanity empty your wierdness is therefore redundant there is no more original sin with which to shock your masses there is only the retelling of what has been done again and again making that retelling interesting doing it in a way that captivates the reader and makes him want to continue  thats the difficult part of the writers craft americo sat jul   pdt  not that obvious mark you dont want to be gillotined do you grins mark sat jul   pdt  we get easily fed up of people who say the obvious and by saying it lie because the obvious is never true obvious therefore    thats when i like it please try to be like me uh yer not jumping off any roofs are you my mother alwys aksed

to the empire on weirdiosity citizens and lurkers weirdness is the very soul of creation if you dont find something new and strange in a book for instance throw that book away its dishonest its just a poor replica of something injected by the media and other instruments of darkness in the veins of the brainless nonentity called the crowds the author of such a book is an unconscious plagiarist and an envoy of inertia many socalled writers are just that people without original ideas feelings sentiments or language they confine themselves to reproducing the pseudoideas current in their society and copying the style of writing dictated by the academy for the brainless  such writers those wretched scribblers who do not try to always create a new and more beautiful world in each book they write those parrots of the brainless crowds can sometimes sell their products because prostitution may be a well paid job but they are worse than prostitutes they are the opposite of creators and must be laughed at in this empire where only souls able to originally express their divine uniqueness can live in peace and merriment we get easily fed up of people who say the obvious and by saying it lie because the obvious is never true truth is naturally shocking because you need some effort to think it and find it for yourself you need to read a lot and learn how to read and see whats behind words and exotic adventures and try to understand that the written word is a sacred mystery and cannot be dismissed just because it is not the good morning of your milkman you need to be a creator to be a reader and if you do not have that gift of creativity in you stop reading and turn on the tely thats where your particular notebook is not here a place for healthy weird people as its name indicates  writers notebook a hellish place not for the weak of heart or mind so weirdness is the name of the game this nb can easily become a conventional kind of chat room but we are lucky from time to time a

interesting he did his writing in an x foot room or was it x and was regarded as quite the undesireable eccentric in his home town in texas on molly  the folks at cornell found that both her hind legs are broken and the tab is now up over  but shes part of the family and money dont last near as long as the trust and affection in those big brown eyes litter  i set up a userid and password for a

presidential erections and life in the oral orifice… ahhhhhhhh rowhad  glad molly is going to be ok but for  plus i would expect her to come out with a masters degree at least now then who mentioned critics now just remember critics should be pitied not chastised after all they only seem to be critical of the people who can and are doing what they themselves cannot  poor unfortunate scumbags as for those who put one form of fiction above another  egotists snobs posers and sundry other disparaging names and boo sucks to them i always find that a well reasoned argument deflates their egos and

happen to write different ways and different things james michener spends two years on research for a novel and another two writing it i couldnt spend that much time researching anything i dont know how long it will take to write this novel but im still aiming for december of this year  for the definitive copy wish me luck im so busy ill be needing it wedding today have to travel have to travel in our nice outfits and shoes have to arrive wrinkleless and kidless sure ill just pretend i look freshlypressed and ignore the creases the kids will see us looking our best but thats before we leave

remember much though too high on chocolate allein hallee halleecaolcom fri jul   pdt  hahaha  i did it again sigh heather dearthe following post is from me fri jul   pdt  heather i would say that youre a serious artist while im just going with the flow  i had no intentions of being a writer and have no idea where this gift came from or why it decided to settle upon me eighteen months ago im sure god has a plan with it so im just moving along waiting for that to be revealed to me this is the first book ive written that required any form of research and my research consisted of calling my friends husband almost daily and asking him a dozen questions hes an emt and a firemanhandy and what hes done is take what ive printed out for him and handed it around the firestation any discrepancies in the fireman world have been discovered and struck out i also have about  men who are demanding to be in the book at some pointhence the characters jarvis and kirby so far haha i would like to be like you but i dont even know how i just jump in and my characters are there somehow already existing and i know them of them about them i know what theyd say and how  i know how old where they went to schoolits all in my head when i get on the wrong path in a book i cant write i know its wrong so i stop back up to the point when the flow stopped then erase and start over again ive had to do that twice and its worked well other than that i rarely even know whodunit until the end of the book so i think im just a medium some great writer meaning serious artist such as yourself must have died in january of  and i just got in the path of their muse  thats the best i can come up with thanks for the poem hallee tina thu jul   pdt  marinasun what time is that pdt tj marinasun thu jul   pdt  thanks teekay yep its the nb ive given up on figuring out whos in charge arent we all anyway thank you democracy boy i need some sanity too if anyone bops in at am ct on july th  ill be in the chat room for five minutes tada thats the way to plan a chat i can hear the echoes already marinasun heather thu jul   pdt  there is a rather confuddling sentence or two in my last post dont mind me i seem to have misplaced my own perhaps it is mania touching the corners of my frontal lobe perhaps it is coffee heather heather thu jul   pdt  hallee i have spent more than a  week period just delving into the characters writing character composites and histories even conversations ideas both mine for the novel and ideas that characters have story plans as well as personality profiles and motivations this novel just is not the kind that can be written in such a short amount of linear time at least not by me ive had to do some research on police protocol but havent actually interviewed a canadian cop in person that might have to happen just for a few nitpicky details i dont need to do much medical research since i was a nurse before i decided to take on a new way of life  that is also my hopeful career i have thought many times that i could just write it just write it slather it all over one great wad of paper no wasted sheets and if there were details that werent accurate or realistic hey its fiction folks but the more i write and craft the novel to bring forth logical yet unexpected conclusions i decided to reach for realism and depth since that is how i feel this novel will best be expressed i know for the type of issues that evolve in the novel that the smallest details can make or break the readers trust so i have taken the side that lends less artistic freedom and opted for the more technical angle  especially for certain events but that doesnt affect the how as much as it affects the why when it comes to answering story questions connecting plants and deciphering my own hidden symbols i still have all the artistic licence i need  its amazing how scrutiny brings about a certain flavour to a passage now that i have chosen the places to cook i am closer to this story than hopefully apparant to a reader who does not know me this is probably why i also have given the details as rigorous an inspection as possible but im almost ready to go out and bite canines in frustration hair of the dog ya bit the subject matter of the novel demands realistic and sensitive handling and i still have yet to settle on a pitch that will have to wait my next novel i plan on giving myself a larger field to romp in in fact most of the world will be my stomping grounds but that is the next book and im still stranded in the first official novel ie one that will not die in my closet and silently decompose i can see it though ending up with just as much research and planning going into the second book too i think i am starting to know myself better i would like to be able to write as quickly as you do hallee but i also know that so far that isnt the way i work best of luck with your submissions and the search for an agent here is a likely wellknown quote but suffice to say  it fits shoot for the moon and even if you miss you will still land up amongst the stars dr norman vincent peale here is a poem i have savoured for years each time i open one of my older poetry books it might not fit but its beautiful none the less the sky the child looks upwards at the blue sky above he lifts his tiny hand and longs to touch the sky unable to

marinasun teekay thu jul   pdt  the supreme judge is a fraud sasquatch yes i see what you mean i had trust and faith mixed up together hallee wow i got exhausted just reading your post not because it was long it just seemed so busy you are a huge inspiration i have begun the best seller yes i know you are all sick and tired of me saying that but this time i really have and ive written more than two lines yes indeedy i have written  and  pages and they are big pages too i am only going to take tuesday nights off cos just shoot me  charmed are on then ive decided to write on the weekends as you can all see i am a true and dedicated writer  hallee halleecaolcom thu jul   pdt  teekay i write mostly in the morning i get up at  and most days i have until  to write before i have to wake my family i also live relatively close to work and i come home and write for  minutes of my lunch hour  except today when i was solving that riddle  haha then i also sneak in that half hour while my daughter is in the bath every evening if i dont get whats in my head written out i cannot sleep a lot of times i get up in the middle of the night just to type out  or  quick paragraphs i think thats because i never know whats going to happen next so when i finish for that session i immediately start milling the story in my head and coming up with the next paragraph or the next scene up to this point ive managed to write a book in about  to  weeks but my pace seems to have slacked i started the one im on  months ago and i still have  chapters left to write who knows why theres a lot going on in life right now plus theres all that editing that im doing right now anyway  i didnt intend for this to be a novel  hahaha  sorry hallee jon thu jul   pdt  am i back i wonder thanks to pussy im back again on a clean orderly and well organized empire the empire will have no ministers but i saved in my files the psychological prints of those who were my characters here are my conclusions only rachel was totally worthy of my trust she flied a plane to the arctic which saved me from the wild bears and other beasts who were threatening my life and making hazardous my holidays under and on ice and almost impossible my return to save the empire from the barbarians i appreciated her courage more about our th july party with the penguins and the inuits some other time a medal for her faithfulness and courageous behaviour in difficult times and environments no wonder she is the best fiction writer on the block a writer needs a taste for adventure and the more impossible the better only jerry ericsson did something to save the empire from a coup détat in my absence though i firmly oppose some of his views on matters i consider vital i appreciated his character and his sense of duty to fight against pussy  man thats really something youll get a medal for bravour exceptional im sure your soldiers would not have fled at a simple waving and smile of pussy if they were made of your stuff for some reason you wrote the best stories for sm you have the stamina only a continued with his reports thus performing his duties till the end this shows persistence but mainly love for soccer no medal for him courage persistence and character are indispensable qualities for a writer those who do not have them try a different job all the other ministers fled or hid themselves those who protested against the coup d état did it for personal reasons which had nothing to do with the welfare of the empire and only showed earthly preoccupations or psychological weaknesses unworthy of their high rank and position they will not come with me in any future ventures like climbing the everest one of my wildest dreams my determinations the my flower as yacht will be returned to his proprietor he will not be guillotined because pussy asked me to spare all lives and shed no blood and he was a reasonable minister though with a tendency to be biased against france  my favourite team i forgive him for voting against me even i voted against me  what would you expect with such an undecorous candidate as i presented myself to the crowds its necessary to try something different you know we are all fed up of wellbehaved hypocritical candidates and i believe that the best always wins even if he spits on the ice pussy asked me to give the empire the name of international land of freedom and fraternity ilff i insisted on the international to remind americans and other aliens that this is a free international forum for all creeds talents temperaments and persuasions inclusive my new philosophy penguinese  obviously the best and truest this ends the polilogy entitled plots  eat them for breakfast despite its funny title it was a deep study on the psychology of human and other creatures ps for those who followed the series and want to keep it in their fridge for future reference i convinced the supreme judge to accept the shadows thoughts as concrete and valid votes for pussy in any case she would resign in my favour  and i would inevitably save the empire even if she didnt resign one cannot beat ones fate and mine is to be a saviour of empires i also convinced the sj to vote for me  i needed a little vote to show to my friends so the results were one vote for me all the other votes for pussy im really proud of my pretty smart generous and dedicated wife now i deserve some rest from the fatigues of my holidays and the chores of having to recover this delicate empire from the forces of chaos and tedium and pussy like any other creature

humans persons in the way of you call faith i sasquatch trust and do not require same thing you call it faith for this is how the one made me and all creatures humans persons are made with a different way because the one wished for them to choose to love and not to do because they were made to love need what you call faith for that otherwise there is no point because all is the same tree rock creature humans and nothing left after but humans persons are free to desire to choose one or other i sasquatch do not need to do that choosing that is the not same judge creature i sasquatch am not ashamed of any who say sasquatch is friend i do shame at creatures who act as twisted humans persons and do not respect the one mark person i sasquatch think there would not be much fog on that i

entities who have lately posted under the names of jon pussy americo impala kawinkiedinks and queen are not the real jon etc but just their shadows notice that each of them addresses to himherself and not to the respectable notebookers they are only thinking to themselves but have not come to any conclusion yet this brilliant twist in the great story of the coup and countercoup is far from concluded in order to help your fatigued brains understand this incredible plot heres a brief summary of it taking advantage of jons absence his wife pussy performed a coup detat and dissolved the government there was practically no resistance jon who is scuba diving skiing and trying to melt the ice in the arctic knew of pussys treason only recently he called for an election presenting himself as a bloody tyrant and a spittingontheice creature pussy a master in psychology of the crowds used the demagogic technique of melting the hearts the powers that be have just expressed their inner thoughts but not their definitive conclusions only if you read the last volume of this polilogy entitled plots  eat them for breakfast will you know how the story ends im afraid you will have to buy it as its author is getting fed up of his readers and cannot promise to publish it here after all he despises plots and knows that good writing is something completely different sasquatch  arent you ashamed of having such supporters teekay thu jul   pdt  howard ithink sasqy meant that creatures already have faith and dont question things as humans do im glad mollys okay im a sucker for animals

it anyway or at least a couple of lines wish me luck and perserverance tomorrow we can plan how to kill jon or pussy or both it depends on what mood im in btw i think the popes a fraud and i believe they are blackmailing the queen seems the puusycat who went to london to visit the queen was none other than pussy herself word has it she caught the queen doing something rather nasty while she was sitting under her chair no wonder pussy drinks but she cant be forgiven for the dreadful curlers jon emperor at last and again thu jul   pdt  jon theres nothing like a good plot to win the day ill go

this election but the heart has won against reason sensibility against genius conservatism against imagination and ingenuity bad jon was defeated our pretty empire will go on like it ever was a place for nice people to write nice things like i love my husband and kids and you have great talent your dialogues are a masterpiece this is the empire bad jon has always fought and wanted to improve but he appointed a primeminister and ministers who were as good as the italian soccer team with some exceptions which he will certainly reward when he will return to my arms and to our bosom because dear citizens i do not want to be your empress i just want to be jons wife jon i won the election but i resign all my powers and pass them onto you you will always be my lover and my emperor and therefore the emperor of us all please come back and proceed with your idealist attempts at improving our beloved nb americo thu jul   pdt  americo jon im getting fed up of your antics how could you spit on the lovely penguins with the votes of the pope the queen impala the kawinkiedinks and those of the silent majority and the undecided who by historical tradition and week temperament cannot vote but for

submitting this stupid trilogy that im in the middle of editing sorryits really good but i really hate editing to an agent and also at the same time to kensington publishers they publish a line that

book ive written just for a taste of something new i dont think ill be posting anymore of the one im writing now simply because almost half of it is already up as much as id like to think no one would

you all i am working on a web page that deals with a riddle written by albert einstein aver  years ago he claimed that only two percent of the population would be able to com up with the correct answer i thought you all could use a diversion so here it is the way is was given to me there are  houses in  different colors in each house lives a person with a different nationality the  owners drink a certain type of beverage smoke a certain brand of cigar and keep a certain pet no owners have the same pet smoke the same brand of cigar or drink the same beverage the question is who owns the fish clues the brit lives in the red house the swede keeps dogs as pets the dane drinks tea the green house is on the left of the white house the green houses owner drinks coffee the person who smokes pall mall rears birds the owner of the yellow house smokes dunhill the man living in the center house drinks milk the norwegian lives in the first house the man who smokes blends lives next to the one who keeps cats the man who keeps the horses lives next to the man who smokes dunhill the owner who smokes bluemasters drinks beer the german smokes prince the norwegian lives next to the blue house the man who smokes blends has a neighbor who drinks water on my new website i will not only have an answer page for you to check your solution against but a detailed explaination of how to come up

person than as animal i sasquatch believe you are having strange spirit in to make you speak as this it is as the one has said that all creatures became hurt when first fell and need to be brought

call from our daughters neighbor crying and trying to tell me that she needed to get hold of karin because their molly  a st bernard had just been hit by a car i got there in time to hear the guy still complaining about damage to his car and insisting that they his wife was driving was only going  miles per hour in a  mph zone the skid marks about  feet to impact and the fact that molly all  lbs of her was thrown about  feet into the ditch put the lie to that i wasnt going to press the matter right then but then he wanted to know what homeowners insurance they had so he could file a claim for damages i dont remember exactly what i said at that point but from what the others said afterwards i must have led him to believe that a good part of those damages would be bodily injuries that hadnt occurred yet but were about to anyway he and his wife gave us their information and left rather hurriedly and we managed to get molly into the back of my truck and on down to the animal hospital she seems to be not injured as seriously as we thought no apparent internal injuries but a badly broken right hind leg we found out after we got back home that the guy was asking for a gun so he could put her out of her misery right there and asked the woman across the road to lie about what happened if the troopers should ask any questions now i hope my daughter doesnt run into him any time soon shell hand him his head too worked up yet to think much more later howard pussy wed jul   pdt  my brethren ive been praying all day not for my victory in this election which im sure to lose but for my

thought it was enough as is heather heather wed jul   pdt  reports from parliament hill its absolute mayhem folks it seems the prime minister has been overthrown and everything going on as i stand here by the eternal flame in front of our parliament buildings in ottawa is part of the fallout due to her dismissal the ministers are flapping about uttering grievances and shaking fists full of severance forms who knows what will happen there are hundreds of protestors lining up as we speak only some of which are the ministers family members further news audio tape oh god its terrible the people are marching onto the lawns smashing everything in sight a reporter is down i repeat reporter down weve got trouble at three this morning it was publicly declared that the coup detat has pushed some militant protestors to take aim at the government officials involved in the coup police patrols have had to be called in throughout the night and into the morning hours due to the numerous threats of violence from these protestors some of which now include the former ministers themselves people are still running in the streets ranting and rioting declaring political war its dangerous just being near to get a full report  surrounded by the chemical smoke of the eternal flame and long blue shadows she paced in a small pool of light on the sidewalk everywhere from the lawns right out in the centre of the streets and steadily swarming up the paths leading to the parliament buildings were bodies blistering with the hot passions of hatred and blame like a pungent mould ripening just beneath the skin of the fear fruit shouts echoed in the distance carrying a raw waft of it towards her in the wind seconds lapsed building expectation on the spindly legs of rage then with a reverberating crash a faroff street light went out instantly her body trembled with the force of the cascading glass even at a hundred paces carrie smothered a cry in her throat and slipped into the bushes next to the sidewalk hovering under its cool canopy the smell of tension ripped open the night air and sent waves of nausea through her not knowing what else to feel she lifted the weight of the microphone up cradling the foam sphere in the nook of her chin waiting for the sick storm within her to pass but hoping the storm going on around her would hold on collin would be looking for her collin the camera everpresent intruding on her face microscopically inching over her every blemish soaking each pore onto the film collin stripping her bare with a lens uncapped the searchlight poised and hungry every nerve swelled the moment the red light flicked on that gulf of a lens that black hole of a thousand empty eyes reading her every move sucking every word for nutrients live more smashing tinkling cascading glass more shouting that stood far above the constant sea of voices one less light the bushes hugged her seeking to comfort her delicately in their mintscented arms the heady sauce of unrest and nature or were they the same carrie where the hell are you his far away voice stuck into her ribs and made her swallow a reply she heard the scraping of his stiffsoled shoes halt beside the lamp post the warm pastry in his hand leaked lemon and cream mint and sugaredlemon filling topped with cream combining with the dangerously sour wind her stomach twisted and her mouth watered somewhere deep in her bones a shudder took flight carrie the twist in her stomach tightened her bowels churned and opening her jaws she heaved out a gush of vomit it rushed out so hard it missed her teeth completely she bent with the force of it sputtering and retching over the mound of bare earth coating the roots of the bushes carrie what are you doing spasm number two carrie shook with the hot flood spurting from her mouth one arm encircling a branch coollin she moaned his eyes squinted to make out the form bent over beneath the shadowed bushes the sound of liquid hitting the packed soil his unlit beacon carrie channel seven collin shuffled to the edge of the sidewalk staring into the indigo blank until his eyes focused jesus you got food poisoning or something we gotta get this story dont bung out on me now carrie swiped the back of her hand across her forehead collin she was leaning against the bush all her strength directed to her legs trying to stay afloat from the ground lights swept along the sidewalk bouncing with the hurried steps of another cameraman a crowd of highheeled whisperers shoved past collin on the walk without moving the camera from his shoulder he dove towards the bushes his fingers finding the smooth dark fabric of her sleeve and coiling around her arm in one motion he had dropped or eaten the pastry but the singed fruitcream smell still assauled her senses colllin she managed with a slur lifting the microphone with a limp wrist ive puuuked all ooover the mic  your report jon waiting for further news from the front lines heather

my husband swap books and they stand amazed in the worlds that are created sadly though he doesnt think that romance books are worth the time to read regardless of the plot around the romance he simply isnt interested even in what ive written weve been sharing books weve read and discussing them for years and he doesnt want to read something ive written simply because of the romance angle its even hard to find agents that deal in that genre if you look through writers market youll see pop up over and over again no romance and all the while nora roberts continues to make it to the number one best seller every time she publishes a book you are a brilliant writer and i look forward to the day that i can pull your book from a shelf in a bookstore jon i wont give them back i wont youll just have to rewrite them if someone else wants them mark happy anniversary heather no one else entered so i win right  everyone else in this country happy fourth of july christi mon jul   pdt  jon

happen on your end tina i feel your pain i really do i aspire to write science fictiongood science fiction too unlike you ive never gotten the impression of snobbery from others if anything most people think the snobbery goes the other way saying they just cant understand it to me scifi offers the most original and sometimes even the most inspirational reading of any other genre and if you look at amazons top  books of the millenium youll see that theres a heck of a lot of science fiction on that list thats no small potatoes chin up girl creativity is never a waste and you absolutely should have a great deal of pride in your work hello heather rachel horwda mary and marinasun nice to see so many here and hi to teekay who couldnt figure out what she was going to post to all of us you been sniffin fumes in the lab again girlie speaking of smells i believe my popcorn is done woo hoo im off to the movies goodnight thweeties marinasun mon jul   pdt  hi everyone rachel thanks its not my real name  obviously heather what contest see ya all marinasun heather mon jul   pdt  tina dont let it bother you your novel will always be as good as you make it no ones opinion can actually change what is written unless you choose to be swayed by that opinion and rewrite with that in mind critiques from other writers aside if someone puts your work down even if it is merely perceived by the writer that it is a putdown then chase it from your mind with great swooping buckets of ice art is painful to expose to the world id rather run and die hiding some days and thats without a rotten opinion from outside of my head only the little voices in there whispering you cant win you cant make a dime what a waste of time time time i choose not to listen any longer and i step forward here i am heather pshallee nice use of the nasal sense in your piece where are all the rest of the contest entries cmon friends give us your wares oh yes i suppose i will contribute as well but give me a day mary im there i have a parttime nearing full timejob as well some evenings and most weekends i think four hours sleep is an amazing luxury dont you o tina mon jul   pdt  mark in no way was i comparing myself to asimov dont i wish there are masters in every art and that isnt disputed it is the elitist attitude that bugs me the perception that no other art is valuable no my troubled thoughts were seeing parallels between aspiring writersartists when the inevitable question of what do you write comes up and i answer scifi the light of interest usually goes off and i get a glare of disdain had i said drama or historical drama or even crime thriller the response would be entirely different and more than the direct responses are the societal cues open the book section of the globe  mail and find a revue of a scifi go ahead look for it try hard while i dont foresee anything i write being held up to that level of judgement it still creates an insidious perception of what deserves to be considered serious art all things aside it is a personal struggle to allow myself to feel a tiny bit of pride in doing something i love these days id settle for not feeling like im wasting my time in recent weeks ive been beaten over the head with the idea that since i dont have kids and dont have a wow career ive wasted the last ten years of my life the time i put into art is disregarded as a waste i know better but when an attitude is thrown at you persistantly by people you usually respect it starts to eat your beliefs and pull you down sorry to not keep this brief the telegram approach

he stood in the entrance as the heavy door shut quietly behind him running his hands through his hair to shake off the excess rain it was quiet in here still surreal compared to the busy rainy street just on the other side of the wooden doors he walked further in letting his eyes adjust to the dim interior it was rare for him to come in from this entrance but he liked to learn from different perspectives he could smell candle wax and turned his head to watch an old woman light a new candle her hands shook badly enough to make it seem to be an almost painful task he was stepping forward to help just as the wick finally caught the flame the air was stale signs of a room decades old that had never been opened to the fresh air the rain wet bodies and old wood added a musty scent that could never be covered up the pews shone though a sign of care by loving hands and added the essence of lemon wax a woman with tears streaming down her face brushed by him obviously in a hurry to get out for a moment he was nearly assaulted by the power of her perfume but then it dissipated and blended in to the air adding its substance to the collection of thousands before it the closer he got to the front the stronger he could smell the lilies a brief smile touched his mouth at the beauty of the arrangement they were his favorite flower and he sniffed appreciatively as the fragrance intensified they would last several days which pleased him he stepped onto the platform and crossed to the pulpit it was home his home comfortable familiar he laid his notes on the lectern and his smile was brighter as he straightened his collar mon jul   pdt  americo stop good idea stop americo mon jul   pdt  jack forgot to archive the nb before going on holidays i know that he had unexpected extra work to do on the eve of his expedition to hawaii in order not to load the nb too much i suggest that we write only telegrams until he comes back and archives tina sun jul   pdt  why does an artist create and then present that creation to a public that almost always pulls them down i dont believe in high art and low art those are terms used by one societal level to belittle another when in reality none is better than the other art made for entertainment stimulation beauty provocation and function and any other reason lies equal until an elitist opinion showers praise or destruction art is an expression not an object and is always valid to the creator so then why does the artist care about the elitist opinion why do we allow ourselves to be manipulated into submission of the ego until we feel guilty for our creations ive been wrestling with these thoughts for several weeks now its a fight i thought id finished years ago in art school but here it is again under the mask of literature it deflates my spirit saps the words from my mind and thoughts and fingers and the worst of it is that i know better ive found the black foul oil dripping from the tongues of elitists who thought they knew better than i what abstracted form my art should take and rejected them for realism yet i find myself examining my words and wondering if they are worthy enough to waste the time of others after all its scifi sarcasm reeks of black foul oil the triumphs and defeats of my life are in those pages yet they somehow lack validity because the elitist minority frowns on scifi this isnt about criticism criticism is opinion this is about the relegation of creation into craft where the elitist minority can snub and ignore it the only true measure of a creation is whether it fulfills the expression of the creator if it benefits the viewerreaderlistener in any way that is only a perk im meandering a bit and thats a reflection of where my mind is how many people never release their own inner artist because society has already told them it is worthless its an insidious defeat that can even penetrate an aware psyche im no longer daunted by intellectual elitism but it is like a virus it sneaks up in forms you cant see then goes after your weakest defences it can be fought off but only after a bit of misery ooh ive gone and dumped im thinking about not posting this but then why not writing it has helped clear my thoughts and not hitting publish would seem to invalidate the whole thing tj oh yeah heather im working on it i am did my email open up okay mary notdotcalmyahoocom sun jul   pdt  marinasun hi again yeah i meant inkspot and no you dont need to send my daughter an email i just told her user name because she loves to dance so much and she is good too she was born with

screwthreaded oblong  moving in circles  over a set of rods  which lift it again and again  by a series of overcenter springs is i realize my vision of god screwthreaded oblong like a football american football sorry americo with grooves running around it similar to the grooves cut into a screw face that thing down onto a set of pins and it would turn screw its way downhill due to gravity yes yes perfect conditions zero coefficient of friction hey this is mortality trying to understand immortality ok overcenter spring a device used mainly in switches the purpose of an overcenter spring is to keep an item at one end of its throw or the other that is when you flip a light switch from the up position to the down position youll notice a slight tension moving into the center once you get just past center of the switch throw many switches have a spring which completes the switch movement to fully down thats an overcenter switch and its ready to flip back in the opposite direction and do the same job my vision here is of the oblong by gravity turning itself downward as it travels down it presses down and out on the rods that hold it up the rods on overcenter snap springs lift to the up position bringing the oblong back to its starting point but on the opposite ends of the springs so that the whole contraption constantly uses gravity to power the springs which lift the oblong which uses gravity    i did say a day or so ago that i once found approaches to life either artistic or technical this is a hangover from that period valuepush me onclickpushmark mark sun jul   pdt

good taste in music thanks everyone marinasun heather sat jul   pdt  a poetry ring hmmmm sounds very beautiful and the thought is stirring it also sounds like it might weigh an awful lot for my wee finger funny the things one thinks of mowing the lawn i am tempted to bring along at least a piece of paper and pen but always forget a tape recorder would not do i would not be able to decipher what i was saying unless i turned off the mower i like to be efficient economy of words not that i practice that at all times i edit so it sounds as though i write that way to begin with the point is to keep at all times the integrity of your voice uvula is singular and uvuli is plural just had to clear that up and make sure no one calls a single uvula an uvuli and i hate using an in front of words beginning with h  it sounds corny but i hear its correct grammatically im not in the mood to finish my post with what i had thought earlier to say im in the mood to sleep smmeck smmeck my contact lenses are drying out and ive run out of tears you might say a poet is most like a turtle and a bear combined when angry they are unpredictable and could strike without warning when sad retreat into a shell do turtles dream poems when they hibernate all hidden in the mudbank i imagine they must bears dream they dream of fish and clear waters and cubs while they sleep through winter ill bet they dream too that man will not encroach upon their territory going to bed heather tina sat jul   pdt  hello just a wierd thing everytime im online surfing and use the back arrow to return here i get

behind in reading the posts that its pitiful christi i was so caught up in myself last week that i just realized that i never offered you my deepest condolences im glad you had that time with a woman you so obviously loved though my words werent on the page my prayers have been with you and your family since i first read a post from you concerning it rhoda ive added your sisterinlaw to my prayers and i hope your family has a good move i remember my mom moving from somewhere with no walmart to the place she lives now i think she was more excited about an available walmart than anything lydia we had a restaurant my husband and i used to go to in st augustine that had a swing band made up of a group of men who were all together in wwii they played on thursday nights and my husband and i would always make a date to go there that night he listens to classical rock i listen to country but we found a common ground with the swing i miss it americo im glad i gave you a good laugh your comment illicited all of the emotions im certain you were aiming for which is a good thing because i was writing a really tense scene and i needed them thanks for the help marinasun i hope you enjoy it  why do i read hmmmmy first response was to say for the escape but i really dont desire escape  merely entertainment the books i read mirror what i write  fun sexy thrilling  and for the few hours put into a good book im involved in all sorts of adventure music im a big fan of country music  though its disappointing me of late  southern gospel and classic piano kind of an odd combo but its the truth i can tune just about anything out when im writing be it a disney movie or the radio so i dont really find something to set a certain tone okay i think i have it all covered now i hope i didnt leave anyone out i think my eyes may have uncrossed by now time to get back to the editing hallee mark sat jul   pdt  new poem on poetry page mark sat jul   pdt  anyone use the chat function here ive opened

subjects being discussed without looking over my shoulder to see if the boss if lurking and not feel quilty that i am neglecting the paid work i know i sound a little giddy oh well im entitled rhoda drop a line when you return from your vacation and tell your sisterinlaw we are all thinking of her well wishing no matter the source is heartwarming i think she will appreciate the thought i have a husband that should be dead but i believe that all the prayers and thoughts sent his way saved him bye the way moving again you have wheels on everything now right congrats to you and of course your hubby too arik thank you my oldest daughter enjoys reading as much as i do my younger daughter fails to see the draw but perhaps with maturity that will change shes only  and much into her hormones at the present i am a little late on the music topic but i do remember discussing this before no matter i love all kinds of music and although i can tune out the kids the neighbors lawnmower and the tv i cant tune out music i guess because i have no musical talent and i envy those who do it draws my attention when i am writing i have it playing all day at work and doesnt bother me a bit but when i write for some reason it intrudes after the last discussion i tried again to play it in the background i started to hum and lost my train of thought i do enjoy swing very much im not quite old enough to have learned it when it was popular but because it was the music my parents grew up with and because old movies were rife with it old black and white and eary color movies were often musicals improved sound and technology gave birth to a lot of them most of the first movies that made it to tv were these types of film and i guess you could say i teethed on them also some years ago we had a theme restaurant here called the th bomber group it was in a replica of a french farm house surrounded outside by sand bags old jeeps and speakers that played nothing but world war ii era music it was on a strip of land right beside the airport and you could see the planes taking off and landing while you ate good food and super atmosphere it went out of business when they had a really bad episode of food poisionng and were made to throw out their entire meat locker and decontaminate it people just quit going really a shame i wish they could have made a comeback sigh as to the cyer marriage well i dont know many of you here right now but howard perhaps if he could put up with my insatiable curiousity i am grossly under educated for a writer and love to pick the brains of the unsuspecting at least those who are willing to share or perhaps hayden i really want to go riding in the porshe i guess you can tell its been awhile since i have been able to get together with people i enjoy those people who dicsuss subjects dear to my heart music writing travel books and of course who can make nonsense seem like reality from tiny threads of thought who can laugh at themselves and who care for someone they have never met thanks for still being here lydia mark sat jul   pdt  heather  you wrote on crit page most of the poetry i have written does not get posted some of it is just too open there are a few that ive posted and then wished i hadnt but only because under every hard shell there is a softness tender softness so easily bruised and torn interesting an old mentor of mine wrote her doctoral dissertation on the fragile toughness of poets its worth writing about mark sat jul   pdt  mary  hello same here yes simplicity is usually found after much effort emc and the simple black dress both are elegant and both demonstrate a true grasp of something beyond normal observation all  holy cow i went ring shopping webrings that is there are multitudes out there most have the restriction that you must have a home page on the same computer as the ringkeeper look at the directory on webringcom for instance that makes announcing your page somewhat simpler but restricts the range of joiners makes the notebook and workbook look like pretty good ideas let me know what you think mary sat jul   pdt  heather left you an ittybitty note on the pcritiques page ill be back later mary sat jul   pdt  mark i think you are so right about the s influence on todays country music sooooo different than the country my father listened to i dont know if the classical you listen to is mostly for piano  my personal preference or what but if it is solo piano that you like you might want to try george winston there is so much depth to his music despite its simplicity makes it perfect for writing cant believe i didnt mention him before oh im mary by the waynice to meet you mark mlenihanstnyrrcom sat jul   pdt  howard  dynamite eh good spent years looking for the right place to attach this fuse christi  thats what the little kids always sing to the big kids makes me think i must be one of the adults here thanks heather  ok the real proposal since this is a cyberunion of minds intent on writing i suggest we take the old doctors advice about schedule make adjustments to the kind of activity he winked at and make it email ill write three items a day for the first week one item a day for the next three weeks and three items a week until we reach some clarity i think of myself first as a poet but i also have some novel parts to kick out and some essays some of it will be junk because i am out of practice some of it will simply be first attempts some of it will be good your response to my crits on the poetry page said that you had some stuff written that you didnt want public i have nothing on paper like that yet but its with me nonetheless i dont go about with a trenchcoat ready to flash my secrets on unsuspecting strangers but i do honestly answer questions and expect in the course of this marriage to get some probing questions and ask some if our union works we should both become accomplished writers i had a notion while mowing the east portion of the lawn this morning that i should establish a website called poetryring and present it to you then i could say with this ring      will you  music lovers  when writing i like classical at other times i like s and s rock swing and modern country i think an awful lot of todays country took its lessons from the rockers of  and  arik nesisactcomcoil sat jul   pdt  christi  i am here but i

who wanted it so plese remind me  arik howard htuckeystnyrrcom fri jun   pdt  litter  it could only be a block of writers owhard litter fri jun   pdt  hi all warning  long rambling post follows  ive taken the opportunity of a window of lucidity in an otherwise freaky couple of days im just a tad unwell at the moment and have had some pretty awesome hallucinations this afternoon scary stuff but bucketloads of alteredmindstates to write about o none of this is intentional and hallucinations have not been produced in any illegal way  just in case you wondered… someone asked me to repost sillycon so ill put it at the end of this message christi  havent posted since seeing your message no pity but as howard said there are many of us who have been where you are just now you had time to say goodbye and sandy passed knowing that she was loved those are good things and things you will take strength from in the future months being freed from pain is in itself a blessing my thoughts are with you and your family rhoda  likewise my thoughts and prayers are also with you and your sister in law mark  it certainly sounds like you have been through a spiritual maze and i have to agree that many religions seem to be in competition for the monopoly on being the only one that shows the right way life spiritual or otherwise is seldom that simple heater  this bbq is sounding better and better with every new posting so we are going to have nude bungee jumping as well now… well now… i agree also that dirty dishes are decoration or as i prefer to call them in my house an organic artform clayton et al  music my tastes are very eclectic but i have to agree about listening to music without lyrics when im writing lyrics can lead you away from your thought processes all too easily my selection depends on what mood i wish to evoke  upbeat sad energetic slow and easy etc etc and i tend to listen mostly to acousticfolkblues or baroque guitar music although celtic music does it for me too as i dont speak gaelic or latin i can listen to stuff like clannad dan ar bras or mediaeval stuff like gregorian chant or russian orthodox chant to instill a reflective fantasy or historic frame of mind sometimes prior to writing about the period of my own lifetime listening to music of the sixties or seventies or so forth can invoke the mood of the times sixties music especially takes me right to the mindset of the time  stuff like hendrix early bowie matthews southern comfort cs  n james taylor small faces beachboys beatles and so on ad nauseum not to forget the musictoslityourwriststo maestro  leonard cohen ahhh happy daze for contemporary christian music i have to go for the virtuoso electric guitar playing of the glam rockers stryper having dabbled with electric guitars those guys are gggggooooodddd marinasun  dont worry about all the marriages  there are a lot of sadists and masochists on this list at the moment o wb lydia there is a new situation comedy in the uk just now thats called love is a many splintered thing  yup its about marital infidelity… hi and hello to raman hope you are going to hang around as the list is becoming more cosmopolitan and that can only be good for a bunch flock herd school pack  of writers what is the collective noun for writers anyone hi rowhad how could i have forgotten clapton and simon  garfunkel have to agree with you about polka music why do i read vicarious experience enjoyment stimulation or as stated the charter for the bbc  education information and entertainment now as promised sillycon talking of tits judgement by size taut rounded bouncy  a justification of beauty perhaps even worth a silicone society an implant inclined culture… neutering nature  recreating creation in mans perverse image godless plastic people with bits to spare overinflated tits and egos  the cut and tuck of a bankrupt moral code a storm in a dcup perhaps but wheres the beauty in crying with pain dying of cancer melting in front of a fire inspired by pamela prereduction š litterali  jerry ericsson httpmercuryspaceportscomlissaindexhtml fri jun   pdt  you were talking about the group jars of clay if you want some of thier music go to the link above you need real player to listen to it if you dont have it you can get the program for free from realplayercom jerry howard htuckeystnyrrcom fri jun   pdt  mary  almost forgot  thanks for the thought dorie says okay but ive gotta be home in time for supper sasquatch  that is a beautiful thought it almost sounds like the picture of god as the refiner

  pdt  heater  what sport would i like to watch nude bungee jumping sounds interesting ill send you a picture of it when i get home tonight ill send it to anyone else that requests it too seriously what kind of music we covered this a while back but its always a good subject its probably easier to say what i dont listen to  polka music not that i dont like it just not real crazy about it heavy metal has to be somewhere below the bottom of the list ive found i can get better sounds by kicking a galvanized garbage can full of cats and beer bottles down a long flight of stairs i do like mahler bach schubert mozart meatloaf liszt debussey tchaikowsky clapton bb king paul simon etc etc i love celtic klezmer blues jazz gospel etc etc though not necessarily in that order phil keaggy leo kottke brooks williams and django reinhardt again not necessarily in that order are among my heroes why do i read because i can a family circus cartoon said it all a few years ago one of the kids was reading and the tv was playing in the background he said to his mom tv is okay but reading puts the pictures right in my mind i wrote an essay on reading a few years ago entitled the summer i swam the panama canal got published i posted it on the workbook a while back but its gone now ill send a copy to anyone whos interested raman  welcome lydia  welcome back good to see you back on your heads howard

float you in the clouds its on her album the visit her home page is above such variety in musical inspiration i find anything fast or hard to be too distracting when im writing except celtic it can be fast without bothering me im always fascinated by the multiple ways people inspire and support their creativity have a great night tj allein alleinandersonhotmailcom httpalleinandersonmcom thu jun   pdt  tina  ohhh i love celtic music maybe cause im mostly irish especially played on a harp my friend skylar plays the harp and shes really amazing at it i love the song greensleaves  its my favorite i cant wait to get it on cd but unfortunately i need money for that and im not good about saving money sheepish grin allein americo agsousaesotericapt thu jun   pdt  rhoda if you married me youd quickly become a stern humanist defending all the great causes of mankind  past present and future and id probably learn english the perfect couple of two exciting brains how many heathers are there on this nb from the place where he is semihibernatingjon sent a quick almost inaudible message using a shortwaves radio of his invention proposing marriage to the two sic heathers strange people its this soccer thing portugal and holland are out the final on sunday will be franceitaly it will be a match between a secondrate team using an obsolete system based on defence at all costs and by all means and sudden quick counterattacks called catennacio  italy and the french who play good soccer but suffer from the complex of astérix boasting that they can beat everybody but are in fact hopeless without their obélix in the case of their match against portugal who they beat at the last minutes of extratime with a nonexistent penalty their obélix was a crazy linesman and a poor referee europe is in a state of shock because such a sad ending the best teams of the euro were holland and portugal they deserved to play against each other to know which is the best but the fates wanted italy a team of handsome farnientes suffering from chronic rheumatism  except del piero who is a good player and france yes you heard well france i think i had already pronounced that name somewhere hope you know what the complex of astérix is you kick somebody from behind and run to ask your father for help it was the technique the gauls used to keep the romans at bay for some time but in the end the romans made croissants out of the gauls hope the italian farnientes do the same to the french on sunday if not the portuguese will do it in  years time when the euro will be here thats a promise and heres how soccer has become a much more important event at least in europe and south america than world war i  ii a multibillion industry and a headache when ones team lose jerry ericsson jerragsdcybernexnet thu jun   pdt  music to write by  oldies from the s to the s i have over fivehundred songs stored on my computer in real audio format i simply bring up real jukebox and turn it on auto and it selects the music for me i also have an amplifier attached to my sound card and a four speaker system with this setup i could rock the house down but i dont just keep it loud enough to cover the outside noise i did discover a place to enable my writing did it today went fishing all by myself just sat on the dock all alone and gazed out over the lake watching the floats on my fishing line bob back and forth with the waves never saw another soul for over five hours never caught any fish either it was refreshing and i came home in a much better mood write on  jerry heather thu jun   pdt  rhoda i think it just might be too much for americo litter  theres a little pair i dont have big enough brackets on my keyboard to give your eyebrows a raise how about topless highjump and a bbq howard what sport would you like to see o oh happy day my daughter is out of school for the summer that means tomorrow we are all sleeping in for the first time in a year yahooooo im so looking forward to  am in my pajamas if i wear any that is heather rhoda rfortarnnet thu jun   pdt  mary i like jars of clay also me and my daughter also like the austrailian christian group the newsboys but i could not write to their music i too do well with celtic because so far it has fit my subject matter it is soothing yet stimulating music and unobtrusive i also like soundtracks with braveheart titanic and sleepless in seattle being my favorites classical music such as borodin and rimskykorsekov is good i also like beethovan and shubert i just have to tell my husband got a job offer from his company that will take us to tulsa the job involves a substantial raise and a large bonus if frank meets the companys goal at projects end he will give his answer tomorrow afternoon i think he will take it but we are still praying about americo if you want the type of relationship that good fiction is based on then marry me would that not be a thought think of the knockdown drag out fights we could have we could talk about captital punishment gun control nuclear disarmament and the united nations on second thought i dont think you could handle it i am far too emotional and very passionate such a union could precipitate world war iii it would be hell on earth but would be the stuff of great literature i think i will just remain a cyberspinster happy writing rhoda mary notdotcalmyahoocom thu jun   pdt  good morning everybody oh wait its  crap heather jars of clay is an alternative christian rock group the cd is if i left the zoo i like them but agree about lyrics being distracting that is probaby why i like classical pianono words just emotion have a great day everyone writeon heather thu jun   pdt  heh heh tina  if youre that bored you can come and polish my house i tend to neglect some of the clutter until it festoons over top of everything else and i cant find my socks but i dont have much to call clutter myself  its waynes or the kids clutter really the only things i have collected to the point of obsession are copies of my chapter drafts i have a fear of losing my novel again  so even if all of my numerous disks go haywire and must be terminated i still have a stack of copies  the latest neatly thrown in so its first in line  so if need be i can type it all over again i will not lose  words ever again and the stacks are nicely contained in my file folder or tucked into the shelves of my desk clutter bah dirty dishes arent clutter theyre decoration o heather again heather thu jun   pdt  good to see you posting christi you sound very strong and together o and a big hug mary dont have any jars of clay but nin is familiar actually i dont listen to music very often when writing i find that bits of the lyric infiltrate my writing and it becomes too tedious thinning out the seedlings of them and leaving in my own sprouts i do have an assortment of cds that pose less of a threat ie no lyrics but most of the time the music of the keys clacking is enough i am so entwined in the world of writing that the soft tinklings of piano often fail to reach farther than the back of my head disney however  if i happen to be writing while the kids are up  is another story my desk is very close to the tv and if they are watching the hour of tv or one movie they are allowed in one day then its beauty and the beast soundtrack or toy story bugs life etc that leaks in i usually dont get much more than a thought down before i have to either do something else email or dance with the kids during the songs we find it much more fun to get up and flounce around during a movie than sit there and grow potatoeeyes and you know the disney movies always have excellent plot and theme integrity of characters etc essentially they are very well written but there is only so much of woody and buzz i can stand top of the mornin to you all heather tina thu jun   pdt  music oh yeah must have music ottmar liebert seems to live in my cd player the most but these days so does enrique iglesias and a vancouver artist named shelley lennex anything celtic works too clayton im glad to hear youve found your words again im a bit stuck right now too letting ideas simmer and take shape and its so frustrating let it flow i discovered yesterday that being unable to sit for long is a good way to get housework done my home is shining it gets boring standing around doing nothing  tj wed jun   pdt  hello to everyone im in a great mood tonight and i must say thank you all around americo thanks for the strength its a good time to have some extra strength around the house rhoda im sorry i forgot to add my concern and good thoughts for your sisterinlaw i have a good feeling that everything is going to turn out okay i hope im right  sasquatch your story was perfect i had never thought about it that way before but you drew such a vivid picture in my mind ill never forget it on the subject of reading i read to see what its like to live in other peoples skins and to think about things i wouldnt have otherwise thought of i read to learn about humanity i guess i read to learn period its boring but true now on the subject of marriages if you were to ask me today i would first choose teekay because she makes me laugh and keeps me on my toes laughter being one of the most important facets of marriage and since im going all out here i would also have two husbandsamerico and sasquatch americo for my pensive moods and for his passion and sasquatch for his beauty and his musky scent im lucky enough to have chosen mates who werent yet taken so i call dibs thanks for the smiles you sillies christi mary wed jun   pdt  hi marinasun how ya doin im like you in that i listen to different music for different scenes i do have a certain affinity for liszt though especially when my hubby plays it for me gotta love musical soundtracks too les miserables is my favoritecried all the way through the performance the first time i saw it the tragedy and irony are inspiring to me im scanning my row of cds above the computer now and there is everything from jars of clay to nine inch nails so i guess it all just depends on the mood right just checking incya marinasun marinasuntalkcitycom wed jun   pdt  hey clayton i listen to andrew loyd webber and sarah brightman for romantic scenes alanis morrisette for action among others and smash mouth swing and current hits for general i cant write without music pumping in my ears i also get ideas from music music is half the fun of writing all whats the deal with the marriages im  marinasun clayton forsakenwwwcom wed jun   pdt  hey all i finally found an idea i can stay with i know that this is the one i can write with i wont tell you now but i will try to get some writing done soon by the way just a little research question what kind of music do you guysgirls listen to while writing do you listen to music at all personally i like heavy metal why you might ask well the fast tempos and raging lyrics get my brain moving i get ideas and i think better anyway enough of my useless banter bye all heather wed jun   pdt  sasquatch a very wise point you made so wonderful to hear from you and do you mind if i remember what you just posted i liked it so much i might dream on it heather rhoda rfortarnnet wed jun   pdt  jack may you and fran have a wonderful time rachel congratulations on your sisters wedding thanks for your thoughts mark i appreciate your thoughts mary thanks for the prayer rhoda sasquatch wed jun   pdt  christi person long ago i heard of a man who found in the ground some precious gold and wished to make it pure and more valuable he put it into a pot and put the pot in the fire so that the gold melted when the gold turned to liquid the part that was not gold came to the top and he used a tool to remove it this was a long process but he did not give up because he knew that it would be worth it in the end he would take it into his house and it would be beautiful there the way he knew it was finished and pure was to look into the pot and when he could see his reflection his job was done i thought this must be as the one who made all knows when humans persons are ready to be taken into his house when he can see his reflection in them he knows i think sandy person was such as this i must go heather wed jun   pdt  if all of my handwritten scribbles and notes during the writing process of my novel were published as is they would look very much like one gigantic rorschach test it would have to be printed on one enormous foldoutnationalgeographicimitationmap sheet but it would be interesting might tell a story all on its own if you have a translator that is my father should have been a physician he has a signature and handwriting that no one to this day can decipher not even he can read it later its better when he prints but not much good thing we have these keys to keep us from having to hand write everything longhand can you imagine not even having a typewriter like jack kerouac he wrote his first novel on a giant roll of paper towel and submitted it as it was that was on the road see what i mean about misfiring neurons i cant remember if thats the correct title spark and poof whiffle and thunder out of my skull flies visions and blunders oh well i have spellcheck and grammarcheck too though ive never used it rachel it is very good to hear from you kittens are fun especially if theyre just playing at your house for a day its when they wake you up all night that they end up not being quite so cute i am reminded of the assaults my toes have suffered due to a particular kitten i wont mention her feisty name right cat yes you she looks up at me with innocence feigned and a request for milk demanded hang in there christi you are in all of our thoughts hey howard and litter wouldya mind if i joined the fun polygamy polygashmy and gave your muse something to smoulder about how about a bbq then tee hee jon just hasnt made up his fickle

interesting day of posts eh christi loses an inlaw and rachel gains one sasquatch you lurking that circularity is your rhythm section christi and rachel  thanks for posting polygamy takes a lot of energy its a fine idea when youre young and more trouble than its worth after a certain age calvin and mrs coolidge were at a chicken ranch during his presidency the rancher pointed out to the couple that the one rooster in his yard serviced all the hens mrs coolidge asked about his frequency and the rancher said the rooster performed many times a day mrs c turned to the president and said how about that calvin many times a day the president replied yes and each time with a different hen id say she could have used a bit of polygamy in her life i read because i have to i read for pleasure i read for competition i cant believe a newswriter and his editor both let when your on route  this summer    go by and a different writer and different editor let slip with youre finances will be impacted    i taught remedial english to college freshmen in new york and texas in ny the kids couldnt distinguish are and our  they are both pronounced r as in are you coming to are party in texas the kids couldnt distinguish on and own  they are both pronounced own as in he was own his own horse anyway the spoken and written differences lead to innumerable thoughts about how we think and precision levels and priorities ever heard someone say a tough road to hoe hmm precision levels the difference between casa blanca and white house why in one pattern is the house first and why in english is the color first priorities walter ong has a wonderful book titled orality and literacy where he examines the effect of literacy on the way we think highly recommended heather  selfmastery wasnt that a seinfeld episode rhoda  plug away good thoughts all  on the good thoughts notion seems to me like the s brought a major wave of interest in eastern philosophy to north america im surprised to see how much of that activity was going on in europe even last century ive been alphabetically a baptist buddhist catholic and universalist i think they all have influences where you find people who want you to believe the right way and espouse thinking along group lines i also think that they all have influences where you find people who want you to believe the right way and espouse thinking for yourself check out the latest issue of us news with tiger woods and mind power on the cover the story is about thinking for yourself you can find that topic in plato augustine and laotse you can find other things in those three as well on the whole what you find in books of philosophy is what you look for pick up augustines confessions in the library take some notes as you scan it

much like some of the other walks of spiritual writings you might read to gather wisdom when needed there actually isnt a mr tao the tao instead is a way of living the tao te ching captures its essence quite neatly it was written by lao tse hundreds of years ago there are hundreds of translations still one of the most popular guides to the tao ways of living i must have three copies all translated by different people if you wish to have an english summary of the taos ideals the neatest book ive found is called the tao of pooh tao is pronounced dow same as the stock cant recall who wrote the tao of pooh will have to dig it out and take a gander there is also now an accompanying book to the tao of pooh i think it is the ti of piglet i havent read it yet i cant vouch for my accuracy on that title either have a wonderfilled day and may all who need be blessed tenfold heather tina wed jun   pdt  christi lots of warm thoughts and good prayers for you and your husband and sandy youre proof that love and strength and compassion are unlimited and endless tj rhoda rfortarnnet wed jun   pdt  christi my thoughts and prayers are with you and your family a part of sandy will always be with you i feel that way about my mother somehow i have the impression that she knows what i am experiencing and what i am feeling i dont think loved ones ever really leave us though they are not with us in body once in awhile one of my children will say something that sounds just like her or ill see one of her expressions on their faces sandy will too live on in many different ways still i know you miss her heather wise words from mr tao thank you for sharing them allein interesting observations about your world leaders it also goes to show how complicated and multifaceted human beings really are i think we should always keep the big picture in mind when we consider giving people power why do i read well i must i suppose reading is entertainment education and so much more in contrast to television i think reading stimulates parts of the brain that no other medium can you can get emotional impressions in movies as you can in books but as far as picking up detail and getting depth out of a subject nothing beats a book i agree with jerry one mate is more than enough who ever invented polygamy just didnt have his head on straight my cyber life is very dry and very chaste so consider me a cyberspinster besides jon is already spoken for so who else could there possibly be americo and heather thanks for your prayers happy writing rhoda heather wed jun   pdt  here is a relevant passage from the tao te ching selfmastery  those who know others are intelligent those who know themselves have insight those who master others have force those who master themselves have strength those who know what is enough are wealthy those who perservere have direction those who maintain their position endure and those who die and yet do not perish live on chinese symbol  insight  to have the radiance of the sun and the clarity of the moon heather wed jun   pdt  christi my thoughts and strength are with you its true and i like that saying of sandys very much we need a suitcase to carry all that we collect over our lifetime but when we leave the suitcase behind its because we dont need to take physical things on that trip in fact we cant take anything physical it is a voyage of the soul the psyche when we need our next suitcase it is like saying we need to learn more things in the material realm take comfort in the fact that sandy has learned all she needed to learn in her lifetime as for the rest of us suitcases we still have many things to learn heather americo agsousaesotericapt wed jun   pdt  christi i hug you with all the strengh of the earth i was expecting sandy to start her wonderful voyage so i was not surprised to read your news i am under the impression that the moist in my eyes is gods dew on the splendour of the universe well meet again

silent words onto your sisterinlaw christi wed jun   pdt  hello friends i come bearing bad news but im not devastated so no pity sandy passed away early on monday morning around  our emotions are up and down and inbetween but mostly im just happy that shes free of the pain she was in i was incredibly scared to see her that morning knowing that she wasnt in her body anymore i dont know what i expected really but when i saw her it was amazing she looked exactly the sameher eyes half way open and her jaw relaxed i could have sworn shed blink or move her hand or something then i touched her face and it was very cool it didnt feel coldnot like they describe in the movies it was like when youve been sitting under the air conditioner too long and your whole body is chilly i couldnt lose the feeling that she was still there it took me some time before i realized she really wasnt and that she wasnt going to come back into that body she always said her body was just a suitcase and now i knew what she meant but the compassion i felt for that tired used up body was overwhelming and i kept wanting to touch her like i had when id spent time by her side these past weeks maybe its strange but i actually was able to be happy for her happy that shes free ive learned more from one womans death than ive learned on my own in my entire life im simply not as afraid as i used to be for you allein you great big sweetie hug and mark sandy is my motherinlaw she had a malignant brain tumor that went undiagnosed until it was far too late and from start to finish it was only a month and a

she passed over so on the eighth of july well have a memorial service in her honor celebrating her life she gave me so many gifts the most important of which are not even tangible except of course for my lovely husband im honored to have known her and im honored to have loved her she was the strongest most giving woman ive ever known and we will miss her dearly i meant for this to be short but look

heather tue jun   pdt  ugh i detest the capslock button at least i detest where it was placed whoever designed the keyboard sorry typewriter and then the keyboard i would love to time travel and kick his or her asses just have a tumble and rip out some eyeteeth bicuspids and infuse a bit of my knuckles into their latimus dorsi their upper maxilla and even their uvuli not only is the setup continually frustrating no one has designed a keyboard or computer that hooks up directly to the mind so i can just think what i wish to write and it is done the voice program recognition thingy well kick that creators ass too and the keyboard  well whoever added the stupid f buttons and the capslock should have his brain removed and my fist surgically inserted whoever thought up the shift button or the control button should be immediately forced to reckon with all these fingernails digging into his or her grey matter not much of a reckoning by then but i digress so much i havent begun to say what i originally clicked on the post now virtual button for litter i laughed and laughed and even hooted hooters at your jigglicon must go time to get some a little bit of work done not that im counting commas mind you that would be entirely too tedious a proposition for me right now one probably dumb question litter why are you counting commas i know youre trying to finish your final edit

heather jerry ericsson jerragsdcybernexnet tue jun   pdt  why do i read  to escape the everyday world and for a time live a different life to learn the news to communicate with my friends americo to

cold front and i have been down with a sinus infection staring at the computer for too long gives me an awful headache i went to the doctor today so perhaps it will get better take care all rhoda americo tue jun   pdt  now for intellectual stuff when one finishes a book one hates it it never is what one dreamt of it thats why to publish is a painful experience you look at your book and you feel terrible thats why you write another one its called the myth of sysiph sisyph then come the reviews if they tell wonders about your book you feel that the critics are a bit limited if the critics tell horrors you feel like killing them thats why i would rather be figo or any other good footballer than a writer i would like to be happy and not permanently discontent with what i write i sometimes like a page even a chapter when i am feeling generous towards myself but never a whole book just a moment you start liking your book three years after you published it thats when you compare the one you disliked with the latest ps perhaps wed better talk about marrying one another americo tue jun   pdt  tonight is marriage night i want to marry allein and you people married people can also get in this is just virtual and to be male or female is not important heather would you like to marry teekay or do you prefer somebody else and why the why is important i want to marry allein

pdt  hi guys and guyesses taking a break from comma counting  have i said before how much i hate selfediting… im reshaping the end of my manuscript to open things up a bit  suggestion from the publisher and i have to say it has made the end a lot better in relation to the rest of the story it wasnt a bad ending but it didnt leave anywhere to go trust a publisher to look at the option of a follow up mary  way to go what did i say about the negative criticism from your mentor obviously the publisher also disagreed with himher i forget something else i forgot was to write a poem of the same format like i promised sucky memory i shall do so without fail or without excessive fail o as soon as i get my edit off to the publishers for the final time dont denigrate the achievement  poet of the month is good mark  i think therefor i am i think think what think i think or think i am if i only think i think … bugger it  keep on trying  youll get there from what you have written on the notebook it doesnt look like you have a problem strangely though my wife no longer walks up stairs in front of me o true story now  almost everyone i know that is creative looks at there work when it is finished and thinks it is crap on completion of something you are much too familiar with it and how you envisaged it  you cannot always judge it yourself and i have found that it is best to look at something when you have let it lie for a time not when you have just finished it looks like you have lots of memories to draw on when all said and done you can always write about how you feel not being able to write sound silly  works for me with the poetry that nobody gets to see… teekay  its not like you to talk a lot of shit o heather  tuning fork vibrating … i wish people would stop putting ideas like that in my head oo ohmmmmm wow a  year old dryer  id be glad to get one that worked past  years howard  i think im way overdue you some mail all yall  hopefully ill be able to give

jun   pdt  allien  as i may have mentioned before when i get bored i play around with emulators an emulator is a program that makes your computer act like a different type of computer for example i have one that turns my computer into an old commodore  another that turns it into a nintendo and so forth well i found one the other day that emulates the sharp ex you may have never heard of this computer neither did i the reason being that it was never sold in the usa it is a totally japanese computer many of the games on it are very good renditions of old arcade games but there are lots of them that are role playing games all in japanese though you might like to get a copy of it and practice reading japanese it is available from the above link and if you do a search for ex roms you can find sites that have games for it jerry rachel tue jun   pdt  arik  i read books for a few different reasons sometimes i will read a book for the simple reason that one of my children gave it to me as a gift i will also read a book if a friend tells me that it is very good other times i will read books because they interest me i have read books for research purposes as well most of the time when i read it is in hopes that what i read will help me to improve my own writing i have had some very good books brought to my attention and have thrilled to the reading i like to see how other authors bring things together i like to look at what makes me react and respond i will mark these pages then go back and review them after i have read the book i like to see the different styles the different ways of organization i guess if i am truthful i read to learn more about what it is that i love to do i love to write take care you rachel heather tue jun   pdt  tina left you a crit in the wb novel

to learn how to become rich and famous so that i can go to italy heather tue jun   pdt  that should have been medium not mediums where did my grammar fly to perhaps it dug a deep tunnel instead and is sitting henceforth under my house i must resurrect it heather heather tue jun   pdt  yes jerry i think it is more common for men to be boys around their fathers and women are more like sisters once they are both adults but a parent is always a parent no matter how many other roles all of us take on as we grow arik to anwer your simple but not stupid question i love to read because it takes me into the minds of other people other daydreams other worlds and i love language especially my own which is piglatin kidding i love to read because it expands my mind teaches and tickles me it connects

terrific tuesday afternoon heather allein alleinandersonhotmailcom httpalleinandersonmcom tue jun   pdt  heres something i got through email those who havent read this choose wisely those who have ignore this who would you choose a rhetorical question its is time to elect a world leader and your vote counts heres the inside scoop on the three leading candidates choose wisely candidate a consults with astrologists hes had two mistresses he chain smokes and drinks  to  martinis a day candidate b was kicked out of office twice sleeps until noon used opium in college and drinks a quart of brandy every evening candidate c is a decorated war hero hes a vegetarian doesnt smoke drinks an occasional beer and hasnt had any illicit affairs ready to choose these were all world leaders which of these candidates is your choice candidate a is franklin d roosevelt candidate b is winston churchill candidate c is adolf hitler surprising isnt it dont feel bad  i chose c too my brother on the other hand chose b however that was because of the sleeping till noon and drug usage ciao allein arik nesisactcomcoil tue jun   pdt  people i have to ask you something it is very important question so try to unswer is siriuslly why do you read books thank you mark tue jun   pdt  howard  i like that picture of heather as a tuning fork in the key of d wouldnt you say  well id say shes not likely a flat note jerry ericsson jerragsdcybernexnet tue jun   pdt  heather intersting slip there boys when it comes to their fathers most men are still boys  guess its a guy thing heather tue jun   pdt  top of the mornin to you all jerry my father in law bought us our dishwasher hes the kind of person that likes to swarm his sons in luxury that way they dont complain that theres a rather large lack of communication i sure dont mind having the dishwasher and my husband happens to be the only son out of four that communicates with his dad on a friendship basis with understanding and mutual respect they still dont communicate fully but getting there my husband is the favoured son im the favoured daughterinlaw because i always send thank you cards and letters i send pictures of the kids because we dont see his dad that often what seems odd to me is that the other sons and their wives dont send thank yous for the things he buys or does for them but thats not really my business its their prerogative if they choose to stay silent i appreciate what my father in law does even if it is covering over a deeper problem at least he is trying in his own dysfunctional way to show his sons that he cares your dishwasher on the other hand is not a token to cover over dysfunction a dishwasher is a handy tool besides who needs dishpan hands especially not your lovely wife a little luxury goes a long way my father in law is also into photography as a side interest and that gives he and i some common ground you see there is always some way i can help if communicating with my father in law even in small ways such as talking about photography can open him up a bit to expressing himself he will feel more able to communicate with our family it might repair some of the damage for all of his sons as i said quite a long time ago there was abuse in my husbands family when he was young and it continued for many years my husband was the only one to stand up and rebel when he was older to take back his own voice and power and choices his father for some reason or other suddenly realized that hed lose him forever if they didnt reach some sort of peace none of the other boys did that sorry grown men and so there is no respect between them they still do everything they can to please their father and have never stood up to him over the time weve been married its gotten better i hope it continues to improve not because his father has shitwacks of money and likes to spend it on us but because having a family that is no longer dysfunctional would be really wonderful its really hard to have a holiday celebration with my husband without him holing himself up and being miserable my husband has a lot of things to work through still and the process seems to be speeding up the better everyone communicates makes perfect sense to me as long as his father is alive there is room for improvement well enough about that my big ol bessie dryer decided it was time to give up the ghost i think she just needs a new drive belt im going to pull her open and apply all of the mechanical knowledge i have retained it shouldnt be too hard anyway the hard part will be finding a company that still carries the right parts shes an ancient appliance definately before  wish they made things to last that long these days if i cant find the right parts anywhere im going to have to go and invest in the gas dryer that matches my washer i have one of those front loading ones the new version of the laundromat type best washer ive ever used used  of the water a regular washer does if we arent working to conserve our natural resources we might as well just bury ourselves in toxic waste now and get it over with water is precious anyway i have to run off with some wet laundry to the local laundromat dont have a clothesline i was thinking of putting one up today but it would be too low not much to attach it to out there and the kids might actually get clothslined by the clothesline see you all soon and dont mind my bantering sasquatch we miss you gariess missing your presence too randall by god where did you run off to i know grammar baddddd and to all a prosperous afternoon when i get back im applying myself to this seat again and finishing chapter  and then some i was pelted with ideas for the dialogue scene last night and it was just the perfect thing for that whole section thanks to all who sent me your muse for a while she was more than willing to help i have returned all of my muses sisters found the cell phone number for mine she was away on vacation and didnt leave

fork hmmmmmmmmmm i agree mark that we usually dont analyze things when were feeling good  if we did wed probably be able to repeat it a little more often reasons why interrupt a good thing i guess analyzing the rotten things is one way to assess the situation  heres an easy assessment technique do i like how im feeling at this moment no well then lets not get ourselves into the same situation again so the horrible ugly and foul are really tools in disguise i guess and poked and prodded does describe the situation well when im walking up the stairs ahead of my husband i really dont mind actually tuning fork ohmmmmm i like that and i think that describes this whole little community weve got goin on here we all reverberate rather nicely with good news howard it was good timing on your part to get out of there i am having trouble downloading my last email message  i am hoping its from tina is it huh huh is it man i think i need to steep my little soul in some refreshments how does a milk bath with almonds sound and a dab of sea kelp just so i dont fall asleep this gunk that is supposed to be great for your skin well it floats around and sooner or later a little bit slides against your leg or arm or buttock and woah youre outta there in no time sounds good right about now heather allein alleinandersonhotmailcom httpalleinandersonmcom mon jun   pdt  hi all i just got back from a shopping spree around town with my buddy liselle her real name is lisa but liselle just sounds so cool so we call her that well i didnt just get back either she came to my house to hang out for a

mon jun   pdt  mary  congratulations thats neat mark  details not much thats interesting straight arrow here or is that strayed arrow i did pick up a couple of pine street thats where they said they were from anyway girls after work one rainy night at about am they were hitching a ride back to binghamton and i happened by they were real friendly and offered to buy me a beer at the lamplighter on washington street right next to the old nys unemployment office got inside and got a good start on a brew when i began to realize that this was a gay bar i was cool didnt let it bother me drank the beer a little faster than usual though got gas real bad then theres a bit of a flap where the two girls were standing and things got real interesting some big ugly black guy turned out to be their pimp started voicing some small displeasure at the way theyd been mishandling his financial affairs bartender suggested they all leave looked at me too i just shrugged it off finished my beer and walked out the girls were by this time really into a screaming match with the pimp and a couple of his friends i decided that i didnt know any of them well enough to carry any weight in what was obviously a private discussion so i walked across the street to my old rambler got in and started to pull out just as i did i rolled the window down just in time to see and hear one of the girls take a swing at the dude as i pulled away he grabbed her by the hair in one hand and her arse in the other swung her around and threw her head first right through the plate glass door of the employment office about that time i spotted a binghamton police car coming up the next block with his signal on to make a turn before he got to us i flashed the lights and swerved out across the street to get his attention then floored it right at him pulled over just in time and hollered out the window at him and told him what was going down about that time he heard the alarm down the street and took off to see for himself dunno if he caught anybody but i was outta there like right now never heard any more about it never really wanted to theres some quality folks in binghamton and yes it really happened just like that might even make a good short story someday except that short stories are supposed to be fiction arent they  i like that picture of heather as a tuning fork in the key of d wouldnt you say nite howard mark mon jun   pdt  avatar  hmm ignore what im thinking would that i could generally speaking i think therefore i am    incapable of writing a novel    capable of capturing snippets which can become poems proust and joyce found expression of their epiphanies joyces term in novels i prefer wordsworths spots of time perhaps its a form of laziness to think about putting out such small pieces americo  thanks for the prize humbly accepted heather  i too like to poke and prod my wife will no longer go up a set of stairs in front of me interesting question on why the writer runs dry  the real question i think to continue the think theme i compared you to a tuning fork yesterday because one tap and you reverberate for a long while but tuning forks measure true notes and i think you have it here i knew id write the flip side of yesterdays poem today in many ways it feels truer than the original yet it doesnt address causes aint it the truth that when we feel crummy we want the cause of it and when we feel good we dont want to examine it howard  missed ya glad yer back at the keyboard any more details about how you know the girls on pine st speaking of louisiana cajun apple pie got red pepper sauce in it all  heres a companion piece to yesterdays so ive got this writers block thing you know and im beginning to think im gonna have to change something maybe go down to liberty street and volunteer at the kitchen the salvation army volunteers of america and several churches all run kitchens for the poor some of those guys are just lost in this world theres no sense trying to rehab them but theres no sense making their lives difficult either im sitting here feeling like my word processor has abandoned me nothing i write is any good and life is crap maybe i could use a good dose of thought i had it bad because i had no shoes treatment salvation army fed me for a week when i was just out of the army and back in college my gi bill had not kicked in and nobody else would feed a college student with resources even though i was broke and starving funny after that i always worked parttime as a cook and never missed a meal met some mean guys in the free kitchen one dude died in a fire he used to brag about how he got paid to set fires because he was so good at it brag about how he didnt always need a soup kitchen im guessing now that neither brag was true another alcoholic fantasy come to a bad end but i cant forget that i was there that there may be another guy there who just needs this little bit of help and i dont want to forget the guys with the alcoholic fantasies who get  minutes of a quiet meal and companionship in a lonely day of brutal dreams most of all i know somethings got to change here mary httpwwwsonicnetpoetryalbany mon jun

enliven the nb with this heat no let it die she goes back to sleep rachel mon jun   pdt  hi all  i think the best way to write is with honesty it isnt always easy to be honest honesty isnt always pretty you have to write with heart i think that if writing lacks grit guts and humor then it could fall flat i like to write about life life is an everything experience i do feel that we need to be able to deal with all of the topics those that are taboo and those that we are comfortable with if we dont test and stretch our personal limits then we are cheating our selves take care all rachel avatar firewingshotmailcom mon jun   pdt  hm scratchscratchscratch sound of nails on head youd think that after all this time id learn to ignore what im thinking thats laughable whats even more laughable it keeps happening over and over again for all of you who are in the depths of writers block laugh at me no laugh with me my feelings wish to stay intact im the one who reads all the writinghelp books then finds out theres no point to them why snorts of laughter come from keyboard what i have done is comparable to studying worrying looking for and reading about aids while still a virgin i dont need help because i havent tried at all no thats not true i have tried just not the way it should have been done without the agonizing ifs if its not good if its not the best it cant be do you see the cycle the pattern what will break it shrug i dont know flexes shoulder muscles but i think im finally ready to try clayton over here you are applauded not for what you have done but for

drivers for their new burger king contract and they have driver training right there theyre promising home every weekend with only a night or two away during the week if you believe them that is i may have to go on the road in order to stir up the trucker yarn ive been trying to finish jerry  a dishwasher ive been thinking of getting my wife a new trolling motor shes getting blisters from these oars or maybe a depth finder so she doesnt have to keep looking over the side whaddya think howard heather mon jun   pdt  good morning all i cannot say whether the best writing is the only morally upright thing and anything less is immoral but i do know the most compelling of stories to us are those that break rules are filled with travail and sin the loss of innocence is somehow very magnetic i think ive used them all those plights to humanity and written with them clinging to my flesh sometimes i lean back to read what ive written and cant  the burden is quite huge and stuffs itself between my back and the chair only because i myself have suffered the loss of innoncence i am certain that we have all felt this burden why is that so compelling a thing to read and now as readers we want to see how the heroheroine gets herself out of the biggest mess imaginable it doesnt make a story surreal to have this protagonist wallowing in more pain than we have personally known it seems all the more reason to see the heroheroine through to the end of the book so as writers we want to grab the audience by the testicles ovaries we want to twist them around make the reader uncomfortable and yet still they ache to keep reading hmmmmm now you know clayton and any who feel they are swamped in writers block if you are looking for something to feel strongly about go out into the world and watch someone of high morals will surely crumble for you just keep looking on the other hand if youve experienced enough to write from memory go right ahead without any extra research heather americo agsousaesotericapt mon jun   pdt  prizes best sentence mark  all the stuff we can argue about the virgin and the whore in philosophy classes and lit classes doesnt mean a thing until you actually go skintoskin with a woman because you just want to get off and she just wants some cash comment thats the spirit of the true writer  only what you have experienced or deeply imagined so deeply that you cry or laugh as if it had been real can become good writing the rest is canned formula plagiaristic immoral literature prize also for the courage of saying it in this select scented ricepowdered

kicking a ball in their cradle i myself cannot resist kicking a ball when i see one soccer was supposed not to be fit for intellectuals some decades ago but now everybody loves soccer the queen of holland watches the dutch team whenever she can go to the stadium and our president of the republic cannot miss a final and those individualities cheer and misbehave in the stadium like any other mortal it has become the most beautiful spectacle on earth doubtless with billions of people watching the most important matches the usa are not doing too badly in that game though many americans do not know that i think they will be world champions in  to  years the canadians are becoming very keen on soccer too next to chess its the most fascinating game in history ps i would like to say that i support portugal of course but please do not think that it is because of patriotism not at all it happens that they are the best well almost the champions of the world are presently the french though the brazilians are the very best arik nesisactcomcoil mon jun   pdt  americna  well thank you i think that was the smartest sentance i dont know if portugal won but i hope they did and that the last

teekay mon jun   pdt  hewoto be said in elmer fudd voice well well well hmmmmmmmm yes well sigh clayton i know just where youre comin from man ive just spent most of the past week beating myself up about ever thinking i could be a writer i think im over it now this session i mean theres bound to be more of em many more i think what you and i need to do is to first get an idea and it has to be an idea about something we really want to write about secondly we then have to break that idea up into chapters and then we absolutely force ourselves to write at least a page every day doesnt matter if its crap we give ourselves a deadline to complete each chapter ie  month or whatever your comfortable with no editing at this stage only when weve finished well put what weve written aside for about a week or so and then well go over it with a fine tooth comb and make it perfect if we come up with other intrusive ides well just jot then down in a notepad to follow up later maybe a whole new novel i think we have to follow the nike maxim and just do it lets start now ive axed my first attempt it sucked but this time wether it sucks or not im just sticking to it and so are you right right anyway when we tell people about the novel we wrote we dont have to tell them it stunk right oh you guys im sure i had other stuff to blather on about but i cant remember it i hear you all sighing with

quo vadis have sent you an email aboot at that last bit was to be spoken with a scottish accent gotta go teething baby heather sun jun   pdt  forgot to reply  no howard i havent heard of that law in nova scotia nor have i heard of someone being arrested over it although i have heard that in a state in midwest us there is a law against singing in the shower basically there were old laws prohibiting this for some reason and the law was never changed i doubt too many were arrested for it but im sure they would have arrested my dad if it were against the law in canada do you know what singing at the top of ones lungs in the shower can do to a daughter with friends over very embarassing i cant remember if embarassing has one r and two s or the other way around and i dont plan on taking out my dictionary eyes  just  not  focusing  very  well goodnight  heather heather sun jun   pdt  howard dont worry i do realize what the common reality is and no i do not need medication in order to get a weekend pass from the institution the incredible functions and philosophies about the human mind are a side interest there is much more to learn and sometimes i just like to poke and prod and see what pops out of others minds i am serious about several things in my life writing is one of them love is another which encompasses family and friends the soul is one as well the ways of the universe and the powers that be are on the same list i cant put those in any particular order as they are all extremely important i would be more than happy to exchange apple pie recipes howard and you are a wellloved person me being one of many who love you glad to see you up to posting already  hope your outpatient procedure went well it certainly looks that way tina i will read your rewrite  but at the moment its getting late and i have some sleeping to do i am also anxious to hear from you even my email is restless  mark your poemstory idea is good but why is the writer starving

street carrols getting to be too commercial the girls there dont give a damn about your two bucks so i hear anyway sasquatch  wherere you at teekay  you too and what book are you asking about i have an opening coming up in my reading schedule americo  i got to watch soccer while i was in germany i liked it a lot but never could get into it physically then i realized why  over there the kids start dribbling a soccer ball while still in diapers no kidding i watched kids on their way to kindergarten kicking a soccer ball all the way to school and back same thing in spain and france over here we learn baseball football and basketball but theres not nearly the gracefulness in these that there is in soccer my eldest daughter played soccer in school and did well at it but would have been no match for your average th grader heater  i had this great long dissertation typed in here about what is and is not but it made my head hurt so i cut and pasted it into a workpad session for further consideration at another time i still love you thoughand someday well have to swap apple pie recipes  i have this great one for cajun apple pie has anyone heard about a law in nova scotia that prohibits the wearing of any scented deodorants aftershave cologne etc i just heard about a  year old who was arrested in school for wearing a deodorant is that factual if so whats this world coming to its late  gnight mark mlenihanstnyrrcom sun jun   pdt  heres a piece of fiction partly inspired by talk of writers block and partly directed by americos remarks on where a writer has to go i keep writing stuff like this that looks like it should go somewhere in a story but which is really probably a poem this thing encapsulates one frustrated moment in the way that a poem is the statement of a single momentvision dunno whaddya think so ive got this writers block thing you know and im beginning to think im gonna have to change something maybe go down to carrol street and see what the hookers look like the college and the library were okay for a few years but the inspiration there has dried up and lets face it the college and library are not hotbeds of action i think the best stuff i ever wrote was based on times i had with working people kind of like steinbeck i dont think i can go back to cargo boats you gotta be young to work the boats but the oil fields off the louisiana coast still need cooks the moneys good its a workingclass life and its a long way from the library had a hooker in new orleans once for  dollars amazing all i had was  and she didnt want to take all my money so she let me keep two dollars i always figured the working girls had a heart in there she proved it to me all the stuff we can argue about the virgin and the whore in philosophy classes and lit classes doesnt mean a thing until you actually go skintoskin with a woman because you just want to get off and she just wants some cash find that in anthropology i never wanted to get off so bad that id commit rape or anything but i gotta do something to get my writing back to life put some lead in my pencil so to speak i gotta go do something thats just different from the library and college jerry ericsson jerragsdcybernexnet sun jun   pdt  clayton  ok here is your next assignment  since you are having trouble coming up with something to write write a ghost story not just any ghost story but one so terrifing that it will curl my toes one so frightening that it will make me fear what goes bump in the night one that will bring fear and terror to anyone who happens upon it in the workbook that should get your writing back on track my daughter is leaving home next week as i have said she graduated from college this spring and now has found her first job it is in a nearby city just a little over a hundred miles northeast from here my son has offered her a room in his home till she gets settled on her own he lives forty miles north of that city this morning we hauled some of her furnature to my sons last night i heard my wife ask our daughter who would do the dishes now that she was leaving while we were at my sons he my daughter and i drove to a friend of my sons who happened to have a dishwasher for sale i bought it for my wife now she has someone to wash dishes for her keeps me out of the dog house for not doing them write on jerry americo sun jun   pdt  and which are the  best teams in this euro thing you ask portugal france holland italy and the  second best ill tell you on thursday and the best ill tell you coming sunday so hold your breath and start betting hallee halleecaolcom sun jun   pdt  happy sunday everyone well vbs starts tonight so im stealing a couple of hours of downtime before this week begins clayton ive read the first chapter of what youve written and you write very well perhaps if you chose something you wanted to write then created a detailed outline of the entire story that would aide you in continuing the story i personally dont write that way i am sometimes surprised at what the next paragraph might bring but then my style probably drives most serious writers crazy but one thing that i do that may help you is that i dont edit anything including spell checking heather  tina will definitely attest to that   until im completely finished i dont want to distract myself or break the flow that seems to come when i sit down and take heathers advice about carrying a notebook i have started that and it is amazing how an idea that just may pass through your mind when you have nothing to write it on can become so concrete you just put your thoughts on paper americo ive never watched european football however my brother has now declared it to be the best sport ever played considering what a huge baseball fan he is i may start watching it to see what it is thats appealing to him as to your comments to mark about the morality of a writer if youre saying what i think youre saying then i must disagree with you i think youre saying that a writer is not a great artist unless he tests and pushes the boundaries of common morality not every reader is seeking to read a tale that contains incest or pedophilia or adultry that ends in depression some readers want to read a happy ending with a thrilling plot to walk away feeling good about life and the people in it i believe that i am a good writer however rough my unhoned skills may be but the audience im seeking wouldnt want to see the dark side of life some people live with that too much and choose to escape it when they can im afraid that i cannot be as clear as you hopefully you can understand what im trying to say marinasun thank you for your crit i too hope one day that you can stand in a bookstore and watch someone buy my books  as i said when i first posted a chapter i had never put anything up for critique before and worried and fretted horribly while i waited for postings i have to tell you that everything that ive received in feedback has done nothing more than spur me on i wish that i could provide as useful critiques as those that are given to me and perhaps one day when i understand this craft better i will be able to candice i hope youre feeling better soon and i hope that your husband survives this  im afraid that my situation wouldnt be much different in the same circumstances its sad how horribly men are babied  hahaha im looking forward to reading your second chapter tina thank you for the critique youve posted for me i feel bad when i get them now because i know that im not nearly as helpful to you as you are to me im in the process of reading your latest post but with vbs happening i didnt finish it like i wanted to this weekend if i didnt live so close to my church i would have just carried a sleeping bag with me i hope i can do it tomorrow sometime during a break at work heather you havent given me a critique that produced any pains yet though i appreciated the smile i needed one when i saw it you and tina have both helped me more than i could have hoped and ive printed the crits in case jack cleans out the workbook before i edit ill certainly refer to them as i edit because there are so many things that i simply dont catch for no reason than the fact that im an untrained rookie im glad youre enjoying it enough to ask for more i was stuck on the end of my book ive had to erase three chapters because i didnt know that chicago had no forrests i could burn down then i just didnt know where to go probably because my creativity has been eaten up preparing for vacation bible school however ive come up with an alternate plan and am now desperate to get back into the swing of writing if all goes as planned i should finish this book by the end of this week then i must sit down and edit my trilogy yuck  no wait  triple yuck so that i can get it submitted ive put it off too long so now that ive taken up so much space ill sign off i hope i didnt forget to respond to anyone have a great sunday all hallee americo sun jun   pdt  arik  how are you my friend are you well or just the same did the viruses eat your computer or did you eat the viruses  i am well and you are also well i hope

discovered i wasnt alone i met ray bradbury and read his book zen in the art of writingand found hope i made a list of what i loved  those things that made my eyes sparkle and my voice bubble when i described them to other folksit was a beginning i went back to college and took creative writing coursesand learned how to feed and water an idea before trying to create a story out of it when i began my novel i had nothing important to sayjust some questions i needed to find answers for  but as the plot develops and the characters grow page by pageim discovering a story worth telling what is the most important person place thing or activity to you clayton what do you enjoy hearing about reading about participating in talking over start with your greatest passion in life anything that excites you will spill onto the page  that inspiration will require the perspiration of godonlyknows how many editing sessions but that finished product will hold readers interest never compare your first drafts to a published authors finished works  i read that online somewhere recentlysounded like a good idea to me hope youll keep us posted on your progress i finished chapter seven of my novel tonight still plodding along happy writing to all ashling arik nesisactcomcoil sun jun   pdt  clayton  you know what i think i think that if you dont have an idea what to write about then just dont

something bad but you hant have the st one yet so wait with it  if youll be interested ill tell you the other   americana  ohh please forget about portugal there is only  good team on this world and

check to see whether the pilot light in my medulla went out its still sparking but with a few minor adjustments ill be fine by the way i am an applet program run that by me again lol  clayton your difficulty is not in finding ideas your difficulty comes from not being able to stick with a good idea or be able to concentrate on only one the solution is to find the central idea to which all other ideas bounce from carry a journal or notepad at all times and write down your ideas as they come when you start seeing a pattern a central theme that pops up time and time again try setting that down as the main most important idea and write a novel around it give it a try see if it doesnt work out into something that will hold your interest long enough to get finished or started as the case may be you may only need the push to get it started and once its running itll go forever  like my mothers convertible heather heather sat jun   pdt  reality hello there is only this what we perceive our brain interprets everything   of our existence so knowing that we are basically our thoughts it goes without saying that as we interpret the world so it is we may also be interpreting that we have a brain or for that matter a body greeks were not the first to perceive the earth as spherical it has always been known as a sphere by at least some of the people inhabiting the planet it just happened to be the common belief of most of the civilized world in that particular age that thought it flat but i reiterate it is still all in the mind i am not a jungian but i do like the way he thought i also study a huge variety of matter and have come to one basic conclusion here i arrive at the same sentence its all in the mind you think therefore you are you are therefore i think you think the world is round therefore for you  it is i think the world is cruel and condemned and to me it is that was merely an example i wont sign that dotted line and believe that the world is cruel i prefer to see that every being has ultimate free will or in tom robbins style choice with that we choose to interpret things in our own way and in choice sits a process  still contained in the seed that is our brain or simplified further our reality is our thoughts we dont need to limit our reality into a physical place or time or concensus we just need to hold good thoughts and our reality is good if i entertain the notion that the world is flat and it looks flat and it feels flat and heaven forbid it even is flat would telling me even the greeks knew it was round mean it cant be flat for me does that mean fiction has to be a lie or can it be anything we want it to be wait i think its about to be said fiction might even be the truth sorry i get carried awayjust fcking with minds again more my own than yours im sure stir stir bubble bubble im making butter out of milk and oil out of engines please pardon me but im mad that my reality is so terrible that there was an attempt on its little dream leave me be with my illusions if thats what some of you think they are maybe im the one who really sees and not the other way round you may think anything you please but so will i heather did that make the scifi friends here absolutely cringe clayton forsakenwwwcom sat jun   pdt  i have come to a very serious problem i cant write i can but it is nothing i have no clue why every idea i have i discard almost immediately they say to write what you know what if i know nothing what if what i know doesnt apply i am confused help i need an idea i like something i can concentrate on long enough

norton iv learned something from  times a virus killed my cute cute cpu  heather sat jun   pdt  here are a few ideas that may incite new soapboxes in the nb but they are certainly welcome a writers adeptship comes from how well he can state the things he sees on the page of his soul how well it is read and understood is a completely different matter the best writers were often misunderstood were still analyzing shakespeare in every english lit class across the continent whether or not writers are liars is our their personal preference and freedom fiction is the way a writer sees something an event people intangibles just because those do not necessarily happen outside of the writers mind does not make them a lie whos world do you live in you may choose as many as you like but they are your worlds and yours alone i live in my world and those that interact and take part in my world are there by choice the way i see my world may not be the way you see your own in fact there are few universalities but they are strong and always true they are usually present in some form or another in every piece of writing ever written embellishment does still not render a passage as false just as the circus alive in my daughters mind is not false but she clearly knows that it is her creation so there is no facade but for the facade of a facade it is one that we have pulled over our own eyes to keep our little minds from bursting you may wish to name that however you see fit and perhaps you see that as an actual facade vs the fact but what are facts facts are nothing more than something severalor many people agree on and have what they believe to be the credentials to make it official experiments are rarely without flaw the earth might very well have been flat before they sailed around it and saw it as round its still all in the mind perception my dears perception heather americo agsousaesotericapt sat jun   pdt  mark a writer is an ordinary person and an artist as an ordinary person he must behave properly and only get drunk on saturdays he is allowed to do all the funny things of any mortal like ordering his wife around if he got a sprained ankle if he is a male or forcing her husband to watch with a smile that lousy romantic film with no soccer in it if she is a female as an artist he must obbey a very strict ethical code difficult to understand by ordinary people he must have the courage to be alone against the morality of the ordinary people he must be unique if his book implies to commit incest or kill a policeman he must do it in his creative imagination only rarely in practice unless he needs more than the usual dose of inspiration in which case he must do what his ordinary conscience tells him to do  and use some sort of precaution in order not to get caught etc nabokovs lolita is a very moral book because despite dealing with the nasty theme of paedophilia its very well written the morality of an artist is the beauty of his books the greater a writer is the more moral that writer is the opposite is also true the more mediocre a writer is the more conventionally moral his works are this latter case of writer must be hanged whipped and be forced to walk naked at the mall his head under his left arm example lets suppose the theme of a novel is marriage the book will be good if there is adultery in it and all kinds of savagery between the couple and all kinds of strange ways to make love between the husband and his mistressesses and viceversa between the wife and her thousand lovers such a book must not however end in divorce but in successive remarriages where the couple starts everything nasty again and so on and so forth until the seventh time they try a decent marriage life happy ending folowed by depression or suicide depression recommended the novel will be bad if it defends what everybody knows that the couple should love each other and that sort of rubbish a novel is highly immoral if it is conventional or badly written as simple as that have i made myself clear of course i have and by the way id better register the copyright of the novel described above it sounds quite moral to me jack

ie how to tell a good lie nabokov said writers had to be the most moral of all people yet he wrote lolita and other glosses on purposeful and accidental incest hmm spun a pretty good yarn somewhere there the most interesting writers can present images which i in suspension of disbelief will accept as true the more you make the storypoemstuff ring true the more you have to craft it against an artificial background and viceversa in order to spin a good yarn you have to be able to tell when and where to weave the artiface against the artifact you have to be an accomplished liar candice byrdchotmailcom fri jun   pdt  heather i am finally getting back to the computer im sorry for showing up looking around and then leaving actually i have nursing my broken right foot and wrenched left

litter let me add my belated but very excited congratulations  on getting your book deal im so proud of you i dont know if this applies in the uk but here once youve got an offer from a publisher its a good idea to query the agent you want letting them know that you need an agent and that you have a contract that youd like them to negotiate for you most times the agent will snap you right up knowing theyve got a bonifide deal in the works and preserve your precious rights at the same time you probably already know all of this but youve got me in a tizzy man i could go on and on but ill stop now after saying hooray for litter heather very nice poem you sound so lonely right now and it makes me kind of sad cheer up woman—you’ve still got us it’s hard to lose a friend but at least you’re not really losing her—you’re just going to have to work harder to see and speak with her now you’ve got me thinking about the fact that if i move away i’ll be losing all my family and friends in one fell swoop i’m wondering if it’s really worth it pussy sorry but soccer holds no thrills for me now a toothless guy on a hockey rink with a big stickthats something different altogether teekay dont you hate it when that happens  i dont have valium but i do have frosted chocolate doughnuts mmm who needs drugs mary thanks for the smile  your post gave it to me ps im a water chicken too thanks to you all for your loving thoughts for sandy she sleeps most of the time now not eating or drinking having lost the ability and desire to swallow since sunday i was sitting next to her yesterday holding her hand and just being with her she was able to squeeze my hand and look back at me and she tried to form a smile but couldnt quite pull it off that attempted smile made my day i just stared at her for the rest of the time trying to memorize her face and the moment it’s very strange this death thing my whole being rebels against the fact that everyone on this earth will eventually die at some point doesn’t seem right here i am going round in circles always to end up at exactly the same spot where i left off if anyone says anything about ‘the circle of life’ i’ll cream them with a rolled up disney poster  love you guys and thanks fer listening christi mary fri jun   pdt  heather boy are we on the same page i feel exactly the same as you hubby gone from  to  computer staring at me all the time one car kids in the poolhang in there you arent as alone as you think heather fri jun   pdt  hallee ill post a crit in a few minutes o just a foresmile to ease any small pains induced by critique teekay havent heard of that author unfortunately when youre the halfhermit and homebody i have become these days visits to the bookstore and library are less frequent but school is almost out for the summer so we will be wading through the library stacks all morning on many a day or at the actual wading pool  me under the closest tree reading and the kids in their suits to frolick i think moreso than the feeling i get of snobbery riding oh so high in the bookstores i am busy writing and that keeps me home if i had as much of a social life as i did prior to my decision to get back into writing as a career i wouldnt have the time or the brain cells well alright i never was able to drink more than two beers in one sitting but two was enough believe me too much socialization and the work just wouldnt be produced catch   no socialization means im holed up and lonely at my desk and the realism of characters in social situations might suffer so here i teeter here i can do both love to all and all a great afternoon today i must say goodbye to one of my last friends from town she is moving out east permanently no other close friends here but my husband and he works and sleeps and tries to get in a kiss or two during the short time between but i get lots of sloppy threeyearold and sevenyearold kisses sigh fly me the muse shes due at the airport any day now ive already sent out the ticket heather mary fri jun   pdt  teekay just wanted to let you know that janet evanovichs hot six was well worth the wait i was laughing out loud reading ituntil my husband gave me the evil eye he was trying to sleep and i coudnt put it down read it in  hours did i punctuate that right looks funny he highly recommends jeffrey deavers latest the empty chair but does admit that some of the characters personalities strayed from how they were in previous books writeon you guys heather thu jun   pdt  thanks hallee ill check it out tomorrow morning i am off to bed but thought id check in here first yes i am a tad anxious to see where things are going where is everyone i must have disgruntled a few people with my superfluous chit chat about socalled regular life not enough references to the literary life which by the way cannot be separated from the rest eat sleep think books novels short stories articles reviews movies in our blood oh all hail language and its versatility wordsmiths weild your pens its good to know that we have others to talk with about well anything really since the writing life is sometimes a pretty lonely existence thank you trudy for another great outing funny how book stores intimidate me yes im sharing this with all of you obviously i think of libraries as my hallowed halls but book stores sometimes evoke strong feelings of being snubbed i cant pinpoint the origin of this feeling however ill think on it a while and see what i can hypothesize anyone else feeling out of sorts tonight must be that great stone gullet of the moon shes watching me a little too closely i think maybe shes hungry for more sm stories alright miss moon ill sleep on that one too bless all of you and keep up with the muse shes a fast mover so are her sisters heather hallee halleecaolcom thu jun   pdt  heather hahaha chapter  is there you seemed a little anxious mary notdotcalmyahoocom thu jun   pdt  heather thank you so much for your thoughtfulness what you did for the little boy and others is commendable and i bet it made you feel great too i dont know exactly why im afraid of the wateri dont remember not being that way but i do plan on doing something about it as i love the ocean everything about it if i run into any locked doors on my my quest to freedom i know who has an extra key thanks again heather  heather thu jun   pdt  mary i was a lifeguard and swim instructor for most of my teen years i taught people of all ages to swim no matter their fears  from  month old babies to the elderly i helped out a boy who had been born with only two deformed fingers and two toes on each hand or foot he had trouble staying afloat because he couldnt cup the water and the way his toes were the water sailed right through hed gone to so many different swim classes  private and regular that they were thinking with great frustration that this was to be his final attempt at swimming when he came to the pool where i worked im sure none of the other instructors had enough gumption to tell his parents why there was a problem i ended up inventing these little paddles out of plywood and velcro for him to wear over the palms of his hands and with his feet we finally found a pair of flippers that were adjustable enough to accomodate his feet  the way the knuckles of his two toes came out they were so wide he couldnt wear conventional shoes his hands were very large too with very short digits he was happy as a clam after he got used to the paddles and flippers and ended up on the swim team a few years later so you see there are always alternate routes to solving a problem for another older person who was so afraid of water she would scream in the shower i asked her to do special exercises during the days in between lessons for the first few weeks of the lessons she would only stick her toes in and sit for most of the lesson quaking with fear on the pool deck she told me by the third lesson why she had been so afraid  someone had thrown her in the lake when she was young in a very deep spot to teach her how to swim shed been scared to death of water for almost thirty years since so for starters i asked her to stand over the sink and pour water over her head with a cup when she got used to the way the water felt running in her ears and eyes i asked her to fill the sink and start dunking her head bit by bit until finally she was able to dunk her whole head and face without fear then she started progressing pretty fast once you get used to water on your face and holding your breath even blowing bubbles the fear of inhaling water decreases she was a real floater so as soon as she got into the shallow end on one of the last weeks of lessons she suddenly had this revelation i float i float im not going to sink to the bottom and i taught her a few techniques to be sure shed stay afloat she enrolled for continuous classes after that and ended up being quite comfortable in the water deep or shallow she wouldnt swim in a lake but at least if she ever fell in shed know what to do so mary if theres anything i can do to help you get over your fear let me know id be more than happy to do what i can through email i know it wouldnt be as helpful as being there in person but you never know to all a happy and prosperous morning tina the rain is wonderful i knew wed have to redo the shingles anyway so it wasnt much of a surprise its only a little leak not much of a problem  dont even need a bucket but we do have to have the roof done soon so we wont get too much water damage there goes another thousand dollars at least and right after we bought all the supplies and built the deck too weve had three water incidents here in one year  the plumbing went flood flood and that was expensive and a big pain in the and then the hot water heater up and died last month soon my big old bessie dryer will kick it and ill be out shopping for one to match my new washer but eventually well have everything running perfectly  should be by the end of this year then next year were ripping out the cupboards and starting the kitchen from scratch the only thing left after that is to have the driveway repaved and to finish the basement into a rec room and bar i am so looking forward to kicking my feet up and looking around  and not finding something else that is either about to break

furia espańola is really something bravo and france vs holand the smile of happiness of my dear friend the queen of holand when the match finished with a win of her dutch you soccerless people do not know what you miss the greatest show on earth heather wed jun   pdt  the notebook anthem o mighty words how you do grace these kindred pages without face from all abounding life and souls come minds to gather tales console words you string the heart itself and pour the thoughts from inner shelf you words you give this only gift  for otherwise the scribes bereft in each word grows the planted seed watered by tears our sweat and need in each vein your richness flows but with expression all can know and with expression all can know well its more of a poem for the love of words ill be back later heather litter wed jun   pdt  good morrow all tina americo rachel hallee mary heather party sounds great  and i have a really tall multicoloured tophat o jerry rhoda allein long time no see ashling and anyone who has posted since my last download of the notebook  thanks for the congrats and stuffl much appreciated i can assure you dont want to go into too many details just now accept to say that the publisher offered and i accepted now we get down to the nitty gritty the manuscript was reviewed by three readers before the decision was made to accept it i find that pretty reassuring that as so often it was not just down to the sayso of a single person be assured that this forum will be the first online to be given the final details as soon as i know them perseverance does pay  it took me almost  years to place it since my first rejection but in that time it has been tweaked trimmed and tightened all things considered it has been a valuable learning exercise congrats to jack and fran on your diving certification and your anniversary… i have almost  years on you as itll be our th in two weeks time ashling et al  i can say that an agent did not represent the manuscript primarily this was a consequence of not being able to find one in the uk firsttime authors are very seldom considered by agents who it seems want to make easy money on the back of someone who has been previously published i can understand this but it is pretty galling for those that have no previous publishing record mags in the uk tend to advise first time authors to put their energies into finding a publisher not an agent and we all know the story of how large publishers only want what agents want and that means going down the line of smaller or newer publishers… patience  all will be revealed in hopefully the near future mary  those dark places can be a bit of an eye opener cant they o heather  thanks for posting jabberwocky  i now have a copy of one of the best nonsense poems ever anybody seen the film jabberwocky by the monty python team strangely wonderful but gory film… i have to get back to the final edit of the final chapter of the watchers  it was suggested to me that i might like to make the end more open rather than the closed nowhere to go one that i had originally written i had to agree i think our reasons for this may have differed though ciao for now litter ps  there aint no way that ill be leaving here writing can be pretty lonely and this is the best forum of the many that i have tried sorry you are stuck with me for a while yet o wed jun   pdt  hi notebookers happy anniversary to the youngsters jack and fran in a few months barry and i will celebrate  years i shall weave a garland of flowers for my hair today in your honorsomething with a celticdruid flavor since today also marks summer soltice now some notebooker should be able to find a nice romantic plot with a scifi slant in there somewheres  may the muse be with all of us  ashling jack beslanwitch httpwwwwebwitchcomrascubaram wed jun   pdt  as i mentioned did get around to archiving so things should load a shade faster also i had a slight snafu in my link to the real video file that has been corrected however the picture is a bit fuzzy for those trying the real server for those with a faster connection ie cable or fast dsl you can check out httpwwwwebwitchcomscubarm instead this will give a crystal clear video take care americo agsousaesotericapt wed jun   pdt  strawberries and a moon definition  a collection of the best shortstories written by members of the notebook including some of those posted in due time in the space generously conceded by jack to that effect and also those directly sent by email to americo theme  food and taste the senses in general including the sixth in a word how the mind responds to external stimuli and how the creative spirit transforms them in literature history  an open internet space from the th november  till the th june  anyone wishing to contribute to the collection may still email their new texts to americo until the th july  objective  the purpose of the idea was threefold a motivate people to write and speak about literature on the nb b improve the writing and the critic spirit of the notebookers c publish in book form the selected shortstories if possible the two first objectives were partly achieved the third remains to be seen the odds are that if the stories are very good and there are enough of them they will be published and their authors paid for them but that cannot be considered a promise yet as the book is still far from completed good intentions and bitter regrets  although some interesting stuff was posted the collection has not yet sufficent quality to be considered for publication even if a publisher offered his services right now the answer would be negative but the deadline is only on the th july who knows if the gold will start arriving nb the happy few whose stories will be selected will be privately informed the other geniuses will have to try again if a second opportunity comes their way only the quality of the stories will be considered not the names of their authors or their philosophicalpoliticalreligious beliefs there is the possibility that contributors revealing talent will be contacted regardless of the intrinsic quality of their stories  for a different project nb those who got frightened please do not bother contributing this is only for serious published writers if they are good and exceptional aspiring authors if they are good the others have the limbo of the workbook to go on exercising nb this will be the last post about strawberries and a moon ps old notebookers are also invited pps if published strawberries and a moon will be dedicated to fran and jack  without any more words heather wcmsentexnet wed jun   pdt  happy anniversary jack and fran and congrats on your padi attainment btw i tried to get to view the footage
