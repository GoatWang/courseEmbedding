augustine florida about acquiring large tracts from the spanish landholders who were anxious to sell gordon raised the necessary capital and arrived at that city in august  in september and october of the same year the two speculators purchased hundreds of thousands of acres from departing spaniards the spanish governor of florida melchor feliu was determined to ascertain the validity of all land titles before properties were sold to british subjects the deeds signed by the governor and the royal treasurer juan esteban de peña affirmed that the spanish owners of the lands had legitimate titles and that according to the treaty of paris gordon and fish had become the true and lawful owners and possessors of those lands the floridanos or spanish citizens of florida were allowed by the terms of the treaty of paris to sell their property to english subjects within a period of eighteenmonths but few buyers were found leaving spanish agents unable to dispose of st augustine properties after the last of the emigrants had left juan josé elixio de la puente formerly chief official of the royal accountancy oficial mayor de la royal contaduria returned to st augustine from havana with an appointment to dispose of the remaining spanish property because the incoming british soldiers had little money and civilian settlers hoped to receive outright grants of land from the british crown few of them were interested in acquiring spanish real estate under these conditions and with the uncertainty of future sales puente was eventually compelled to transfer all the unsold spanish property to an agent who would represent its owners in july  most of the houses lots and lands amounting to almost  estates in and around st augustine were conveyed from puente to fish map drawn by elixio de

of  acres on both banks of the st johns river as far south as ponce de leon inlet and westward as far as alachua and including a considerable portion of the tampa bay area the commissioners for trade and plantations rejected the validity of fish and gordons pretended purchase telling their agents it was inconsistent with the spirit of the treaty governor james grant refused to confirm their grants and distributed the property to actual settlers years later after many applications broadsides initiated through the popular press in america and in england the intervention of influential friends in
