investments individual investors have greater access to alternatives than ever before due to technology and recent innovations in product structures equities  needelman asset management equities our company our philosophy our process equities fixed income alternative investments resources at the moment contact us our stock selection process is based on our philosophy that we can achieve consistent superior longterm results by building portfolios of high quality undervalued companies possessing exceptional management and financial characteristics to be considered for purchase a company must also possess a catalyst which improves the potential for increased shareholder wealth our process emphasizes inhouse fundamental research and the experience of our investment professionals in identifying these opportunities equity portfolio philosophy • we focus on the company as equity stakeholders not just its stock • the company’s management capable focused on the shareholder • the company’s balance sheet strong with good cash flow appropriate leverage • the company’s profits reinvested productively • the company’s business large stable yet still growing we seek companies with strong balance sheets and with comparatively low priceearnings pricecash flow and pricebook valuation ratios stocks are purchased if they are trading significantly below our

fundamental andor technical factors deteriorate from original expectations when continuing analysis suggests a shift out of a particular sector or industry we are independent  needelman asset management we are independent our company our philosophy our process equities fixed income alternative investments resources at the moment contact us investment management is the discretionary authority given to an advisor in order to create a portfolio of assets that achieve the specific goals of the investor  selecting the right advisor is one of the most important decisions you can make regarding your financial life yet selecting an advisor can be confusing professionals that manage investments and wealth can hold a variety of titles including financial advisor wealth manager financial planner among others should you choose an independent registered investment advisor or a financial advisor do you know the difference between them let’s look at some of the key differences between registered investment advisors and financial advisors to help you decide what is right for you some financial advisors work to sell you their products and services we are different because our bottom line is you since we are independent and don’t make profits off selling we can focus on our clients we will work directly with you to help you every step of the way there are many benefits to working with an indpendent registered investment advisor ria rather than a traditional financial advisor rias are legally required by  federal law to uphold fiduciary standards and are legally required to go by the written code of ethics these regulations and rules help ensure you have a financial advocate at your side rias make it easy for clients to pay them for their services independent rias often charge a fee based on assets under management or a simple flat fee for their services  there are no commissions or conflicts of interest there are advisors of any title that can help you meet your future financial goals however registered investment advisors have taken additional steps to ensure your confidence in them by undergoing examination and providing proof that they have the experience to provide you with the best investment solutions they are committed to staying on top of their field by continuing their education and take on a fiduciary duty  while working with an ria your needs are always at the forefront in their decisions aligning your goals when it comes to your financial future our process  needelman asset management our process our company our philosophy our process equities fixed income alternative investments resources at the moment contact us we take the time to get to know you and identify your personal objectives through meaningful dialogue we listen to your answers to key questions that are crucial when considering a unique investment solution we work together to tailor an investment framework that defines your particular risk tolerance time horizon tax sensitivity and liquidity needs once an investment policy and appropriate asset allocation are agreed upon we put your capital to work our mandate is to provide custom portfolios that deliver competitive riskappropriate returns over all market cycles we believe a graham and dodd value investing approach across all asset classes allows steady and consistent performance over time our goal is to build and preserve your wealth using our pool of resources we identify and employ an array of investible assets in order to optimize riskadjusted returns in general portfolios are made up of individual equities fixed income securities and alternative investment opportunities the use of etfs specialty mutual funds or reg d offerings may also be appropriate to address clientspecific needs as registered investment advisors we strive to manage your portfolio as costeffectively transparently and hasslefree as possible because we are unbiased financial advocates we are independent and free of any conflicts of interest we are a feeonly investment advisor no commissions are made and compensation is not tied to the selection of any specific investment your assets are custodied with a thirdparty brokerage firm selected by you while we have discretionary authority to trade on your behalf we never have direct access to any funds in addition we work in concert with your tax and legal professionals seamlessly carrying out your estate planning directives and tax related tasks our approach is simple you’re in control – we do the work at the moment  needelman asset management
