very apparent hurdles for briggs  stratton to overcome which have impacted revenue down m since  in  the company announced that they would no longer place their own branded products within mass market retailers a move that is not surprising given many oems themselves have started to move away from the mass market channel due to lower margin back in  nearly  of sales were directed towards the consumer market that number has fallen below  now and that mix should continue to fall while this move did help boost gross margin up bps since  heavy contribution from this move declining revenue always raises concerns given briggs  stratton pins the commercial market size at a fraction of that of consumerbased sales b versus b why the shift to commercial turf and lawn care lawn and garden sales have struggled as home ownership rates have declined and the overall housing recovery has been tepid additionally although a smaller factor a weak storm cycle has impacted sales of snow blowers portable generators and other stormrelated equipment to consumers most of which tend to be reactionary in nature when buying this kind of equipment further within the consumer market briggs  stratton is seeing some immense challenges from gasoline motor alternatives with battery technology improving and pricing coming down more and more homeowners are shifting to cordless walkbehind mowers and weedeating equipment that shouldn’t be a surprise to any investors that are homeowners step into lowe’s low or home depot hd recently and these are claiming a lot of floor and shelf space including their own store exclusive brands the company’s ties to oems also appear to be eroding husqvarna and mtd both have moved some motor production inhouse or sourced from chinese competitors like loncin commercial is more insulated from these factors the heavier duty equipment mark zeroturn standon mowers has not been broached by electric equipment as professionals have more focus on power and uptime that simply cannot be recreated through electric battery power at least at this point as an added bonus commercial equipment is sold through highermargin dealer and rental channels earning up to  bps higher margins per management even though the market here is smaller it is growing at double the rate of the consumer space heavier use and need for productivity drives a more frequent replacement cycle which reduces cyclicality on a twelvemonth trailing basis fiscal q  through fiscal q  commercial sales increased  inline with management guidance which brings some credence to the company’s chosen direction margin expansion initiatives what makes briggs  stratton a little unusual is that it still manufactures substantially all of its products and equipment here in the united states more than  of the workforce is located here as well as all but one factory the only overseas plant is located in chongqing china which now is the principal manufacturing location for lower price horizontal shaft engines production that was moved from the auburn alabama plant several years ago just to maintain price competitiveness this kind of plant rationalization initiatives are necessary given aforementioned commoditization concerns within the engine segment the company needs higher capacity utilization  utilization in the last fiscal year in order to leverage its cost base and grow margins utilization took a hit several years ago when the company moved out of mass market production eliminating the intercompany sales that took place as these products are powered solely by briggs  stratton products growth will largely be dependent on four factors sales mix commercial versus mass retail the replacement sales cycle trends in housing sales and new construction starts and the weather sales mix has been moving in the right direction and that carries over to the replacement sales cycle given commercial users wear down equipment at much faster rates housing starts are looking less strong existing home sales and housing starts are expected to be moderate  plus or minus a couple hundred basis points depending on who is laying out the prediction weather is looking supportive but there are spots of concern drought conditions throughout the midwest financials valuation all of the company’s debt m gross is held on briggs  stratton’s december  bonds which were issued at  back late in  expect these to be refinanced soon enough they currently trade on a  yield to maturity so the company should be able to pick up m or so in annual interest cost savings on the refinance the balance sheet is remarkably conservative x net debtebitda which makes either an acquisition strategy diversification or a takeover looks like a prime takeover target for private equity or larger oems very attractive recent operating earnings peaked in fiscal  m in ebitda including joint venture income  is expected to show a moderate increase which actually understates the company’s profitability briggs  stratton has been investing in a new enterprise resource planning “erp” system upgrade share in eps impact this year which when coupled with likely strong commercial sales shifts should drive eps towards share in fiscal  by my estimate given briggs  stratton has historically traded around the x earnings range you can easily make a case for share target by the end of next year or  upside given a little bit of necessary in my opinion multiple contraction ebitda should come in the m range building in  upside assuming a x evebitda multiple recent threeyear historical average refinancing the  bonds should yield a little bit of earnings accretion expect m posttax or roughly share as well which isn’t really being priced in either with erp costs fully expensed and starting to contribute

preference for gasoline engines enthusiasm waned rapidly at management level for diesel engines daihatsu briggs  stratton dbs – in an effort to stave off japanese competition during the s briggs  stratton entered a  joint venture with the daihatsu motor company in japan located in shiga prefecture  miles  km from osaka japan construction on the thensquarefoot  m plant began in december  and was completed in april  this joint venture was notable for the manufacture of vertical and horizontal crankshaft engines from  to  hp  kw under the vanguard brand today the plant employs roughly  people on two shifts and manufactures vanguard vtwin engines ranging from  to  hp  kw the mitsubishi agreement – the vanguard line initially consisted of three singlecylinder engines and several vtwin engines the vtwins made by dbs had sold very well but the singlecylinder engine models originally produced at briggs  strattons menomonee falls wisconsin plant didnt fare so well briggs  stratton needed to solve this problem so following discussions with several japanese engine manufacturers it entered into an agreement with mitsubishi heavy industries ltd of tokyo japan briggs  stratton produced only certain parts for the engines while mitsubishi was responsible for overall production and shipping the completed singlecylinder vanguard engines were shipped directly to customers worldwide briggs  stratton had exclusive marketing rights only in north america europe and australianew zealand mhi had exclusive marketing rights under their own brand name in malaysia taiwan south korea and japan in other countries both companies competed with the same product under their own brand names which led to considerable friction and together with escalating production costs in japan caused this otherwise successful relationship to fail briggs  stratton commenced marketing alternative usmade singlecylinder engines under the vanguard brand in early  the komatsu zenoah venture – in may  briggs  stratton entered into an agreement with yet another japanese company executing a year contract with the komatsu zenoah company of tachikawa japan under the terms of the contract komatsu would manufacture a cycle  hp  kw engine in which briggs  stratton would purchase and distribute in the united states europe australia and new zealand said fred stratton this venture was not successful because the rising price of the yen made the engine too expensive in the us the toro agreement – in  briggs  stratton made a license agreement with the toro company of bloomington minnesota usa to produce the toro rtek piston ported version of their e series stroke engine aka lawnboy duraforce for use in toro snow throwers the rtek engine was a cc  cycle that produced from  hp to  hp with only the need to adjust the rpms ranging from  rpms to  rpms and ran using a gas  oil mix of  a high out put hp model was made engine model  for the use in heavier duty snow throwers such as the single stage snow commander    stage power max te  the extra  horse power was obtained using transfer ports in the piston  cylinder wall and ran at the same operating speed as the  hp engines rpms production stopped in  innovationsedit the aluminum engine – this was introduced in  as a means of having a lighterweight engine for applications such as rotary lawn mowers it was improved five years later in  with the introduction of the koolbore all aluminum and sleevebore aluminum with a cast iron cylinder liner easyspin starting – this compression release implemented as an extra hump on the intake lobe of the camshaft was introduced in  to reduce the effort required to start an engine in  a new us federal safety regulation required lawnmower blades to stop spinning within three seconds of the operator letting go of the handle the least costly most common way of complying with the new regulation was to put a flywheel brake on the mower engine to stop the engine and therefore the blade immediately when the handle was released briggs  stratton engineers found engines with the easyspin camshaft were unacceptably difficult to restart after being braked to a quick stop the easyspin lobe hump was moved to the exhaust valve but this reduced engine performance the intakeside easyspin remained in use on briggs  strattons engines larger than those used on mowers subject to the brake requirement but was discontinued in  due to tightening emission regulations the synchrobalanced engine – this  innovation was designed to attenuate vibration caused by the reciprocating mass of a singlecylinder engine the design was a series of counterweights opposing the crankpin the twin cylinder engine – this engine was introduced in  as a means of competing with briggs  strattons rivals particularly japanese firms like honda who were cutting into traditional briggs  stratton markets by producing lawn mower engines and later complete lawn mowers these first models were rated  hp  kw and displaced  cubic inches  cc but were joined in  by  cubic inch  cc models rated at  hp  kw the original price for the  hp  kw version was  lower at us than their singlecylinder castiron version bearing the same power rating industrialcommercial ic – this series of engines initially ranging from  to  hp  kw was introduced in  as briggs  strattons answer to high quality commercialduty engines produced by competitors these engines include heavyduty features such as stellite exhaust valves upgraded bearings cast iron sleeved cylinder bores and highcapacity air cleaners briggs  stratton hybrid – in  at the tail end of the energy crisis briggs  stratton developed the first gasolineelectric hybrid automobile the hybrid was designed by brooks stevens and powered by a twincylinder  hp  kw briggs  stratton engine and a large electric battery magnetron ignition – this solid state ignition system introduced by briggs  stratton in  eliminated the points and condenser system the performance of which steadily degraded between required periodic maintenance service magnetron was made available for retrofitment to briggs  stratton engines made since  competitor tecumseh had made a capacitor discharge ignition setup since  for their cast iron engine models expanding its availability and making it standard equipment on vertical shaft engines powering lawn mowers in late  five years before the advent of the briggs magnetron defunct competitor clinton engines commercialized a piezo spark pump ignition without breaker points in the early s logo historyedit the briggs  stratton logo was always a masthead but it has been changed several times over the course of the companys plus years pre war logos – – this logo started off with a diamond shape and read briggs  stratton and its home city of milwaukee wis usa below it in the middle it had the words  cycle on the top mast and the words gasoline motor and phrase made in usa on the bottom mast about  briggs  stratton added the more familiar shape of a diamond split across the center with a banner gold logo – – this logo had the name briggs stratton and its home city of milwaukee wis usa below it in the middle it had the words  cycle on the top mast and the words gasoline engine and phrase made in usa on the bottom mast gold logo ii – – although similar to the last logo this had differently arranged wording the name briggs stratton was written in a new logotype however this design also included the horsepower rating above the gold logo in the white field its city of location were in the middle as before only this time the patent numbers were eliminated if you look at a decal on a production engine from the bottom portion of the mast there were some engines produced until  that used the prior logo from  the red white and black logo –present – this is the companys current logo the logo has the name briggs stratton in black letters on the white midsection of the masthead the words  cycle engine are on the red top portion of the mast and the city line milwaukee wisconsin usa is written on the black bottom portion of the mast although the logo hadnt been changed much since then the wording on the top and bottom sections of the mast were removed in  although the company continued to use these two sections with the respective wordings original red section and

briggs  stratton engines are commonly used on lawnmowers as well as pressure washers electrical generators and a wide variety of other applications their original castiron engines were known for their

briggs  stratton engines are commonly used on lawnmowers as well as pressure washers electrical generators and a wide variety of other applications their original castiron engines were known for their durability but the companys success was established following the development of lightweight aluminum engines in  the aluminum engine was the perfect solution for the recently invented rotary lawnmower due to its lighter weight and lower cost the company started in  as an informal partnership between stephen foster briggs and harold m stratton sf briggs was born in watertown south dakota and graduated from south dakota state college now south dakota state university in brookings in  the idea for his first product came from an upperlevel engineering class project at sdsc this first product was a sixcylinder twocycle engine which stephen foster briggs developed during his engineering courses at south dakota state after his graduation he was eager to produce his engine and enter the rapidly expanding automobile industry bill juneau a coach at south dakota state knew of briggs ambition and the entrepreneurial interests of harold m stratton a successful grain merchant who had a farm next to juneaus farm so he introduced the two in  their fledgling company set a record in the automotive industry selling the briggs  stratton flyer the red bud at record low prices of us eventually briggs and stratton settled on manufacturing automotive components and small gasoline engines briggs purchased an engine patent from ao smith company and began powering early washing machines and reel mowers as well as many other types of equipment the company went public on the new york stock exchange in  during world war ii briggs  stratton produced generators for the war effort some prewar engines were made with aluminum which helped the company develop its expertise in using this material this development along with the postwar growth of s suburbs and lawns helped secure briggs  strattons successful growth throughout the s and s stephen briggs went on to purchase evinrude and johnson outboards and start the outboard marine corporation frederick p stratton sr the son of harold stratton served as chairman of briggs  stratton until his death in  frederick p stratton jr served as chairman until his retirement in  in  briggs  stratton sold the automotive component business the resulting company is strattec security corporation in  the company acquired its consumer generator business from the beacon group and formed briggs  stratton power products the beacon group had previously purchased the consumer products division of generac corporation now generac power systems in  in  the company added simplicity manufacturing inc and snapper inc to the briggs  stratton power products line murray inc one of its largest customers collapsed owing the company  million and to minimize the loss briggs  stratton purchased the name marketing rights and product designs of that company in  briggs  stratton announced it would be acquiring the victa lawn care business from gud holdings limited australia for a million acquisitions agreements and joint venturesedit farymann diesel gmbh – – based in lampertheim near mannheim in germany this was the first foreign acquisition briggs  stratton had ever made and was a poor fit with the companys acknowledged expertise in high volume low cost production they officially completed the acquisition on may   despite investing in new production methods briggs  stratton never understood the very low volume highly customized nature of the aircooled diesel engine market after considering adding italys lombardini to increase its presence in the diesel market as well as a failed attempt to develop its own designs briggs  stratton accepted defeat and sold the company to a private investor for a minimal amount to avoid further liabilities since the energy crisis had not affected the us markets preference for gasoline engines enthusiasm waned rapidly at management level for diesel engines daihatsu briggs  stratton dbs – in an effort to stave off japanese competition during the s briggs  stratton entered a  joint venture with the daihatsu motor company in japan located in shiga prefecture  miles  km from osaka japan construction on the thensquarefoot  m plant began in december  and was completed in april  this joint venture was notable for the manufacture of vertical and horizontal crankshaft engines from  to  hp  kw under the vanguard brand today the plant employs roughly  people on two shifts and manufactures vanguard vtwin engines ranging from  to  hp  kw the mitsubishi agreement – the vanguard line initially consisted of three singlecylinder engines and several vtwin engines the vtwins made by dbs had sold very well but the singlecylinder engine models originally produced at briggs  strattons menomonee falls wisconsin plant didnt fare so well briggs  stratton needed to solve this problem so following discussions with several japanese engine manufacturers it entered into an agreement with mitsubishi heavy industries ltd of tokyo japan briggs  stratton produced only certain parts for the engines while mitsubishi was responsible for overall production and shipping the completed singlecylinder vanguard engines were shipped directly to customers worldwide briggs  stratton had exclusive marketing rights only in north america europe and australianew zealand mhi had exclusive marketing rights under their own brand name in malaysia taiwan south korea and japan in other countries both companies competed with the same product under their own brand names which led to considerable friction and together with escalating production costs in japan caused this otherwise successful relationship to fail briggs  stratton commenced marketing alternative usmade singlecylinder engines under the vanguard brand in early  the komatsu zenoah venture – in may  briggs  stratton entered into an agreement with yet another japanese company executing a year contract with the komatsu zenoah company of tachikawa japan under the terms of the contract komatsu would manufacture a cycle  hp  kw engine in which briggs  stratton would purchase and distribute in the united states europe australia and new zealand said fred stratton this venture was not successful because the rising price of the yen made the engine too expensive in the us the toro agreement – in  briggs  stratton made a license agreement with the toro company of bloomington minnesota usa to produce the toro rtek piston ported version of their e series stroke engine aka lawnboy duraforce for use in toro snow throwers the rtek engine was a cc  cycle that produced from  hp to  hp with only the need to adjust the rpms ranging from  rpms to  rpms and ran using a gas  oil mix of  a high out put hp model was made engine model  for the use in heavier duty snow throwers such as the single stage snow commander    stage power max te  the extra  horse power was obtained using transfer ports in the piston  cylinder wall and ran at the same operating speed as the  hp engines rpms production stopped in  innovationsedit the aluminum engine – this was introduced in  as a means of having a lighterweight engine for applications such as rotary lawn mowers it was improved five years later in  with the introduction of the koolbore all aluminum and sleevebore aluminum with a cast iron cylinder liner easyspin starting – this compression release implemented as an extra hump on the intake lobe of the camshaft was introduced in  to reduce the effort required to start an engine in  a new us federal safety regulation required lawnmower blades to stop spinning within three seconds of the operator letting go of the handle the least costly most common way of complying with the new regulation was to put a flywheel brake on the mower engine to stop the engine and therefore the blade immediately when the handle was released briggs  stratton engineers found engines with the easyspin camshaft were unacceptably difficult to restart after being braked to a quick stop the easyspin lobe hump was moved to the exhaust valve but this reduced engine performance the intakeside easyspin remained in use on briggs  strattons engines larger than those used on mowers subject to the brake requirement but was discontinued in  due to tightening emission regulations the synchrobalanced engine – this  innovation was designed to attenuate vibration caused by the reciprocating mass of a singlecylinder engine the design was a series of counterweights opposing the crankpin the twin cylinder engine – this engine was introduced in  as a means of competing with briggs  strattons rivals particularly japanese firms like honda who were cutting into traditional briggs  stratton markets by producing lawn mower engines and later complete lawn mowers these first models were rated  hp  kw and displaced  cubic inches  cc but were joined in  by  cubic inch  cc models rated at  hp  kw the original price for the  hp  kw version was  lower at us than their singlecylinder castiron version bearing the same power rating industrialcommercial ic – this series of engines initially ranging from  to  hp  kw was introduced in  as briggs  strattons answer to high quality commercialduty engines produced by competitors these engines include heavyduty features such as stellite exhaust valves upgraded bearings cast iron sleeved cylinder bores and highcapacity air cleaners briggs  stratton hybrid – in  at the tail end of the energy crisis briggs  stratton developed the first gasolineelectric hybrid automobile the hybrid was designed by brooks stevens and powered by a twincylinder  hp  kw briggs  stratton engine and a large electric battery magnetron ignition – this solid state ignition system introduced by briggs  stratton in  eliminated the points and condenser system the performance of which steadily degraded between required periodic maintenance service magnetron was made available for retrofitment to briggs  stratton engines made since  competitor tecumseh had made a capacitor discharge ignition setup since  for their cast iron engine models expanding its availability and making it standard equipment on vertical shaft engines powering lawn mowers in late  five years before the advent of the briggs magnetron defunct competitor clinton engines commercialized a piezo spark pump ignition without breaker points in the early s logo historyedit the briggs  stratton logo was always a masthead but it has been changed several times over the course of the companys plus years pre war logos – – this logo started off with a diamond shape and read briggs  stratton and its home city of milwaukee wis usa below it in the middle it had the words  cycle on the top mast and the words gasoline motor and phrase made in usa on the bottom mast about  briggs  stratton added the more familiar shape of a diamond split across the center with a banner gold logo – – this logo had the name briggs stratton and its home city of milwaukee wis usa below it in the middle it had the words  cycle on the top mast and the words gasoline engine and phrase made in usa on the bottom mast gold logo ii – – although similar to the last logo this had differently arranged wording the name briggs stratton was written in a new logotype however this design also included the horsepower rating above the gold logo in the white field its city of location were in the middle as before only this time the patent numbers were eliminated if you look at a decal on a production engine from the bottom portion of the mast there were some engines produced until  that used the prior logo from  the red white and black logo –present – this is the companys current logo the logo has the name briggs stratton in black letters on the white midsection of the masthead the words  cycle engine are on the red top portion of the mast and the city line milwaukee wisconsin usa is written on the black bottom portion of the mast although the logo hadnt been changed much since then the wording on the top and bottom sections of the mast were removed in  although the company continued to use these two sections with the respective wordings original red section and service parts black section until  modelsedit cast iron modelsedit  cast iron – s cast iron suction carburetor – httpsitesgooglecomsitebriggsmodelsengine  cast iron – s cast iron suction carburetor –

competitor clinton engines commercialized a piezo spark pump ignition without breaker points in the early s logo historyedit the briggs  stratton logo was always a masthead but it has been changed several times over the course of the companys plus years pre war logos – – this logo started off with a diamond shape and read briggs  stratton and its home city of milwaukee wis usa below it in the middle it had the words  cycle on the top mast and the words gasoline motor and phrase made in usa on the bottom mast about  briggs  stratton added the more familiar shape of a diamond split across the center with a banner gold logo – – this logo had the name briggs stratton and its home city of milwaukee wis usa below it in the middle it had the words  cycle on the top mast and the words gasoline engine and phrase made in usa on the bottom mast gold logo ii – – although similar to the last logo this had differently arranged wording the name briggs stratton was written in a new logotype however this design also included the horsepower rating above the gold logo in the white field its city of location were in the middle as before only this time the patent numbers were eliminated if you look at a decal on a production engine from the bottom portion of the mast there were some engines produced until  that used the prior logo from  the red white and black logo –present – this is the companys current logo the logo has the name briggs stratton in black letters on the white midsection of the masthead the words  cycle engine are on the red top portion of the mast and the city line milwaukee wisconsin usa is written on the black bottom portion of the mast although the logo hadnt been changed much since then the wording on the top and bottom sections of the mast were removed in  although the company continued to use these two sections with the respective wordings original red section and service parts black section until  modelsedit cast iron modelsedit

milwaukee wisconsin the company is based today in wauwatosa wisconsin briggs  stratton engines are commonly used on lawnmowers as well as pressure washers electrical generators and a wide variety of other applications their original castiron engines were known for their durability but the companys success was established following the development of lightweight aluminum engines in  the aluminum engine was the perfect solution for the recently invented rotary lawnmower due to its lighter weight and lower cost the company started in  as an informal partnership between stephen foster briggs and harold m stratton sf briggs was born in watertown south dakota and graduated from south dakota state college now south dakota state university in brookings in  the idea for his first product came from an upperlevel engineering class project at sdsc this first product was a sixcylinder twocycle engine which stephen foster briggs developed during his engineering courses at south dakota state after his graduation he was eager to produce his engine and enter the rapidly expanding automobile industry bill juneau a coach at south dakota state knew of briggs ambition and the entrepreneurial interests of harold m stratton a successful grain merchant who had a farm next to juneaus farm so he introduced the two in  their fledgling company set a record in the automotive industry selling the briggs  stratton flyer the red bud at record low prices of us eventually briggs and stratton settled on manufacturing automotive components and small gasoline engines briggs purchased an engine patent from ao smith company and began powering early washing machines and reel mowers as well as many other types of equipment the company went public on the new york stock exchange in  during world war ii briggs  stratton produced generators for the war effort some prewar engines were made with aluminum which helped the company develop its expertise in using this material this development along with the postwar growth of s suburbs and lawns helped secure briggs  strattons successful growth throughout the s and s stephen briggs went on to purchase evinrude and johnson outboards and start the outboard marine corporation frederick p stratton sr the son of harold stratton served as chairman of briggs  stratton until his death in  frederick p stratton jr served as chairman until his retirement in  in  briggs  stratton sold the automotive component business the resulting company is strattec security corporation in  the company acquired its consumer generator business from the beacon group and formed briggs  stratton power products the beacon group had previously purchased the consumer products division of generac corporation now generac power systems in  in  the company added simplicity manufacturing inc and snapper inc to the briggs  stratton power products line murray inc one of its largest customers collapsed owing the company  million and to minimize the loss briggs  stratton purchased the name marketing rights and product designs of that company in  briggs  stratton announced it would be acquiring the victa lawn care business from gud holdings limited australia for a million acquisitions agreements and joint venturesedit farymann diesel gmbh – – based in lampertheim near mannheim in germany this was the first foreign acquisition briggs  stratton had ever made and was a poor fit with the companys acknowledged expertise in high volume low cost production they officially completed the acquisition on may   despite investing in new production methods briggs  stratton never understood the very low volume highly customized nature of the aircooled diesel engine market after considering adding italys lombardini to increase its presence in the diesel market as well as a failed attempt to develop its own designs briggs  stratton accepted defeat and sold the company to a private investor for a minimal amount to avoid further liabilities since the energy crisis had not affected the us markets preference for gasoline engines enthusiasm waned rapidly at management level for diesel engines daihatsu briggs  stratton dbs – in an effort to stave off japanese competition during the s briggs  stratton entered a  joint venture with the daihatsu motor company in japan located in shiga prefecture  miles  km from osaka japan construction on the thensquarefoot  m plant began in december  and was completed in april  this joint venture was notable for the manufacture of vertical and horizontal crankshaft engines from  to  hp  kw under the vanguard brand today the plant employs roughly  people on two shifts and manufactures vanguard vtwin engines ranging from  to  hp  kw the mitsubishi agreement – the vanguard line initially consisted of three singlecylinder engines and several vtwin engines the vtwins made by dbs had sold very well but the singlecylinder engine models originally produced at briggs  strattons menomonee falls wisconsin plant didnt fare so well briggs  stratton needed to solve this problem so following discussions with several japanese engine manufacturers it entered into an agreement with mitsubishi heavy industries ltd of tokyo japan briggs  stratton produced only certain parts for the engines while mitsubishi was responsible for overall production and shipping the completed singlecylinder vanguard engines were shipped directly to customers worldwide briggs  stratton had exclusive marketing rights only in north america europe and australianew zealand mhi had exclusive marketing rights under their own brand name in malaysia taiwan south korea and japan in other countries both companies competed with the same product under their own brand names which led to considerable friction and together with escalating production costs in japan caused this otherwise successful relationship to fail briggs  stratton commenced marketing alternative usmade singlecylinder engines under the vanguard brand in early  the komatsu zenoah venture – in may  briggs  stratton entered into an agreement with yet another japanese company executing a year contract with the komatsu zenoah company of tachikawa japan under the terms of the contract komatsu would manufacture a cycle  hp  kw engine in which briggs  stratton would purchase and distribute in the united states europe australia and new zealand said fred stratton this venture was not successful because the rising price of the yen made the engine too expensive in the us the toro agreement – in  briggs  stratton made a license agreement with the toro company of bloomington minnesota usa to produce the toro rtek piston ported version of their e series stroke engine aka lawnboy duraforce for use in toro snow throwers the rtek engine was a cc  cycle that produced from  hp to  hp with only the need to adjust the rpms ranging from  rpms to  rpms and ran using a gas  oil mix of  a high out put hp model was made engine model  for the use in heavier duty snow throwers such as the single stage snow commander    stage power max te  the extra  horse power was obtained using transfer ports in the piston  cylinder wall and ran at the same operating speed as the  hp engines rpms production stopped in  innovationsedit the aluminum engine – this was introduced in  as a means of having a lighterweight engine for applications such as rotary lawn mowers it was improved five years later in  with the introduction of the koolbore all aluminum and sleevebore aluminum with a cast iron cylinder liner easyspin starting – this compression release implemented as an extra hump on the intake lobe of the camshaft was introduced in  to reduce the effort required to start an engine in  a new us federal safety regulation required lawnmower blades to stop spinning within three seconds of the operator letting go of the handle the least costly most common way of complying with the new regulation was to put a flywheel brake on the mower engine to stop the engine and therefore the blade immediately when the handle was released briggs  stratton engineers found engines with the easyspin camshaft were unacceptably difficult to restart after being braked to a quick stop the easyspin lobe hump was moved to the exhaust valve but this reduced engine performance the intakeside easyspin remained in use on briggs  strattons engines larger than those used on mowers subject to the brake requirement but was discontinued in  due to tightening emission regulations the synchrobalanced engine – this  innovation was designed to attenuate vibration caused by the reciprocating mass of a singlecylinder engine the design was a series of counterweights opposing the crankpin the twin cylinder engine – this engine was introduced in  as a means of competing with briggs  strattons rivals particularly japanese firms like honda who were cutting into traditional briggs  stratton markets by producing lawn mower engines and later complete lawn mowers these first models were rated  hp  kw and displaced  cubic inches  cc but were joined in  by  cubic inch  cc models rated at  hp  kw the original price for the  hp  kw version was  lower at us than their singlecylinder castiron version bearing the same power rating industrialcommercial ic – this series of engines initially ranging from  to  hp  kw was introduced in  as briggs  strattons answer to high quality commercialduty engines produced by competitors these engines include heavyduty features such as stellite exhaust valves upgraded bearings cast iron sleeved cylinder bores and highcapacity air cleaners briggs  stratton hybrid – in  at the tail end of the energy crisis briggs  stratton developed the first gasolineelectric hybrid automobile the hybrid was designed by brooks stevens and powered by a twincylinder  hp  kw briggs  stratton engine and a large electric battery magnetron ignition – this solid state ignition system introduced by briggs  stratton in  eliminated the points and condenser system the performance of which steadily degraded between required periodic maintenance service magnetron was made available for retrofitment to briggs  stratton engines made since  competitor tecumseh had made a capacitor discharge ignition setup since  for their cast iron engine models expanding its availability and making it standard equipment on vertical
