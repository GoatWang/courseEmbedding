correct march  will be remembered as the date the disruption of america’s healthcare provider system began the experienced entrepreneur launched the app for his fledgling austinbased company medici technologies llc that day to coincide with the start of this year’s south by southwest conference and festival consumers can use the app to text physicians on call who can instantly answer concerns for a fee of  similar to an office visit copay users also have the option of adding their own doctors to the app and inviting them to participate enlarge serial entrepreneur clinton phillips seated second from right with part of his team is… more arnold wellsstaff “we’re going to be as wellknown as uber” phillips chiropractorturnedstartup guru said without averting his eyes or breaking a smile during an interview at his downtown office “health care is desperate for change we have an incredible product an amazing group of investors a very smart team and an enormous market” he also didn’t shy away from the possibility that this day period could be medici’s “twitter moment” the socialmedia site based in california mushroomed into prominence during sxsw  “we’re going to be a  billion company” predicted the south african native  whose wife jade was formerly “thunder” on the south african version of the american gladiators reality tv show “the only question is whether that happens in two years or four years this is a ginormous opportunity it’s really about building a new health care ecosystem” the startup which began operating in stealth mode in april  spent about  to introduce medici at sxsw said phillips who has founded two other health care companies that money paid for the physicians on call a branding statement with the medici name on the lanyard worn by all sxsw interactive badge holders and  people hired to roam the streets of austin to showcase the app and explain how it works by late november  the company had raised about  million from more than  investors — and had one of the biggest austinarea capital raises during  phillips doesn’t plan to raise more funds until october he said the company will move its  employees on april  to new offices on the th floor of the bank of america financial center at  congress ave from its current digs at the wework complex across the street at  congress avenue “right now we’re focused on execution” he said “we’re focused on patients and doctors using the app to solve problems we want to know what people value what they choose and how they choose then we’ll know what we have to do” sxswstyle afflictions those who download the app will have free access during the day sxsw events to  austinarea health care providers for  hours a day through the end of the festival users will be able to text any of those providers with questions for free during an initial consultation phillips chose those physicians to address what might be expected afflictions amid an event like sxsw internalmedicine specialist dr tobin lim for example will be on hand to help alleviate hangover symptoms veterinarian isaac croudep can suggest remedies to those experiencing separation anxiety from their pets dr elaine hamilton a pediatrician could talk parents through dealing with a sick child on sixth street and nutritionist carly pollack may recommend foods that provide a healthy energy boost phillips himself is available for anyone experiencing back pain “ninety percent of doctor visits we make for the rest of our lives will be this way” phillips said “we won’t be sitting around in waiting rooms filling out paperwork” no longer bound to office hours or unnecessary trips to urgent care centers or emergency rooms patients could simply may text their doctors when a problem arises the option allows the doctor to explain that the ailment can wait until the next day to be assessed in person that alone would result in significant savings to individuals families health care organizations and insurers inappropriate visits to emergency rooms are among many avoidable burdens americans place on us health care experts say the app also provides flexibility for the providers hamilton said “this is a good way to stay connected with my patients and demonstrate i value that relationship” said hamilton a veteran doctor of  years who works at westlake pediatrics in west lake hills “we can still communicate when the office is not open that’s advantageous to me and my patients they can get a hold of me and i have the flexibility to get back to them on my schedule” hipaa compliant medici’s platform is the first in hamilton’s experience to offer texting no telemedicine service she worked with had that option she said the app also provides for the sharing of photos and videos and it complies with the  health insurance portability and accountability act commonly known as hipaa that and the cybersecurity of the app made hamilton comfortable that her patients’ privacy would be protected “the direction medicine is moving in is one of more convenience to patients” hamilton said “i want to be a part of that wave” pollack the nutritionist pointed out another advantage she would no longer have to share her personal cellphone number that has become a problem occasionally when pollacks private time was invaded by client calls she said another boundary the medici app sets is a financial transaction each time someone contacts her “the app sets the expectations that each consultation will be  and for that money the client will get the highest level of care” pollack said plus if someone is suffering gastrointestinal symptoms due to a detoxification regimen or is at the grocery store and uncertain of what specific food to buy that person may contact pollack and get an instant reply “clients shouldn’t have to wait three weeks for an answer if they’re not feeling well now” she said “the app provides the ability for client support in real time” regardless of this week’s outcomes the medici team already has major events scheduled as it rolls out its expansion during the upcoming months already in the us and france medici also will be operating in brazil india mexico and south africa by the end of the year phillips said while phillips framed the future of medici in terms of what will happen he did admit to one hope he has regarding the company elon musk the founder of spacex and tesla also is from south africa phillips hasn’t met him but he would like to “he’s my hero” phillips said “a year from now it’d be nice for people to be saying that i’m the elon musk of
