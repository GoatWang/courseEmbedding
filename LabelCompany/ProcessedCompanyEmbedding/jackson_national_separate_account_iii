separate accounts the separate accounts  selected subaccounts of the separate accounts the divisions invest in underlying funds the underlying funds that are separate series structured as feeder funds the feeder funds and together with jackson and the divisions the requestors of openend management investment companies in a masterfeeder arrangement the divisions invest substantially all of their assets in the feeder funds in reliance on section de of the  act the feeder funds are managed by secregistered investment advisers that are affiliates of jackson each feeder fund also in reliance on section de invests substantially all of its assets in shares of a corresponding series of an unaffiliated registered management investment company each a master fund and collectively the master funds the contract owners interests in the divisions are registered as securities under the  act the shares of each feeder fund and the shares of each corresponding master fund also are registered under the  act each division’s assets other than cash will consist solely of shares of its corresponding underlying fund whose sole portfolio holding other than cash will be shares of the master fund in which it invests as a feeder fund the separate accounts are unit investment trusts uits registered under the  act and the feeder funds and the master funds are series of openend management investment companies registered under the  act the separate accounts feeder funds and master funds are therefore subject to section f of the  act you propose that each division and feeder fund in calculating its portion of annual share registration fees required by section f of the  act and rule f thereunder should be permitted to exclude from the aggregate sales price of its securities the aggregate net sales price of master fund shares that are in effect sold through the feeder fund to the division under circumstances where registration fees have been paid on the aggregate net sales of master fund shares to the feeder fund in accordance with rule f and form f you assert that such calculation and payment would be consistent with the purposes of section f of the  act and rule f thereunder analysis section b of the  act generally requires a registrant to pay to the commission a fee to register the securities it proposes to offer section f of the  act and the rules thereunder modify the  act registration provisions for certain registered investment companies section f of the  act in relevant part provides that an openend management company or uit shall be deemed to have registered an indefinite amount of securities upon the effective date of its registration statement and shall pay a registration fee based on the aggregate sales price for which the company’s securities were sold pursuant to a registration of an indefinite amount of securities under section f during the previous fiscal year which is then reduced by the aggregate redemption or repurchase price of the securities of the company during that year and by the aggregate redemption or repurchase price of any securities of the company that were not used in prior years rule f requires an openend management company to file a form f accompanied by a registration fee not later than  days after the end of any fiscal year during which it has publicly offered its securities the commission and its staff have consistently taken the position that share registration fees under section f of the  act need only be paid once in certain circumstances where an investment vehicle is effectively limited to a single substantive share issuance notwithstanding the fact that its structure may involve multiple share issuances in adopting form f in  the commission codified interpretive advice previously given to the american council of life insurance the acli letter that registered investment companies such as the underlying funds in which variable insurance contract premiums are invested through unmanaged insurance company separate accounts are not required to pay registration fees on securities they sell to the separate accounts in its adopting release the commission stated that the acli letter was intended    to prevent payment of registration fees under the  act for the same aggregate proceeds from investors in variable insurance products that results in ‘double counting’ of assets on which such fees are paid to that end instructions b and c to form f make clear that an underlying fund that files a notice under rule f generally is not required to include securities sold to an unmanaged separate account typically organized as a uit that issues interests that are registered under the  act and on which registration fees have been or will be paid therefore the underlying fund generally is not required to pay a registration fee for those securities provided that such an underlying fund relying on this exemption does not include shares redeemed or repurchased from such unmanaged separate accounts for purposes of netting sales under rule f in a  letter to gmo trust the gmo letter the staff stated that it would not recommend enforcement action to the commission under section b of the  act section  of the  act or rule f thereunder against funds in a masterfeeder structure if the funds excluded the net sales price of shares of each master fund sold to corresponding feeder funds when calculating aggregate sales proceeds for purposes of form f among other things the staff conditioned its noaction assurances on the representation that each feeder fund was a feeder fund in a masterfeeder structure and would invest substantially all of its assets in a corresponding master fund you assert that it would be consistent with our position in the gmo letter and section f and rule f if each division and feeder fund in calculating its respective portion of annual share registration fees excluded from the aggregate sales price of its securities the aggregate net sales price of master fund shares that are in effect sold through the feeder fund to the division under circumstances where registration fees have been paid on the aggregate net sales of master fund shares to the feeder fund in accordance with rule f and form f in particular you note that such treatment would avoid the payment in effect of triple rule f registration fees for the same aggregate proceeds from contract owners of vips that are invested in the divisions that in turn purchase feeder fund and indirectly master fund shares your request is conditioned on representations that are designed to ensure that each division and feeder fund is a conduit for investment in the corresponding master fund and that appropriate share registration fees are in fact paid based on the facts and representations in your letter we would not recommend enforcement action to the commission under section b of the  act section f of the  act or rule f thereunder against any of the requestors if rule f registration fees are calculated and paid in the manner described in your letter and summarized above our position is based particularly on your representations that the separate accounts will be registered as uits under the  act the feeder funds and the master funds will be registered as openend management investment companies under the  act all interests in the top two tiers of this threetiered structure will serve as conduits to the contract owners’ interests and benefits under the vip funded through the various entities each division will invest exclusively in a corresponding feeder fund under normal circumstances each feeder fund will invest at least  of its assets in the shares of the corresponding master fund with any remaining assets held in cash if a division or feeder fund avoids a registration fee on any sales of its securities the nonfee securities by excluding the net sales price of any master fund shares from the amount of that division’s or feeder fund’s sales that are reported in item i of form f redemptions or repurchases of such nonfee securities will not be used for purposes of determining the redemption or repurchase price reported for that division or feeder fund in items ii and iii of form f if either the division or the feeder fund incurs registration fees thereby permitting the two other entities to avoid registration fees with respect to any related securities they issue redemptions or repurchases of such nonfee securities will not be used for purposes of determining the redemption or repurchase price reported for such two other entities in items ii and iii of form f and in all cases the division the feeder fund or the master fund will pay the registration fees that the other two entities have excluded from their payments each division feeder fund and master fund shall request and obtain confirmation in writing prior to the payment deadline of the identity of the entity making the payment and of the actual payment and the entities shall remain liable for payment of the applicable rule f fees until payment has been made this response expresses our view on enforcement action only and does not represent any legal or interpretive position on the issues presented because our position is based upon all of your facts and representations any different facts or representations may require a different

there are two major types of annuities fixed and variable fixed annuities guarantee the principal and a minimum rate of interest generally interest credited and payments made from a fixed annuity are based on rates declared by the company which can change only yearly fixed annuities are considered “general account” assets in contrast variable annuity account values and payments are based on the performance of a separate investment portfolio thus their value may fluctuate daily variable annuities are considered “separate account” assets there is a variety of fixed annuities and variable annuities one example the equity indexed annuity is a hybrid of the features of fixed and variable annuities it credits a minimum rate of interest just as other fixed annuities do but its value is also based on the performance of a specified stock index—usually computed as a fraction of that index’s total return the financial services overhaul enacted into law in july  included language keeping equity indexed annuities under state regulation variable annuities are subject to both state insurance regulation and federal securities regulation annuities can be deferred or immediate deferred

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
