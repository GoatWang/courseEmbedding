restorativebridgesa bridge is a fixed dental restoration that serves to replace one or more missing teeth several different types of bridges have been used throughout the dental industry over the years but some have remained more popular than others the most traditional construction of a dental bridge involves a false tooth attached between the two crowns another type of bridge that is still in use is a resinbonded bridge that bonds metal or porcelain wings attached to a fake tooth to existing teeth on either side of the missing teethrestorative dentistryregular dental hygiene is very important but when something more serious affects our teeth we need a little extra help getting them in good condition again diseases decay and damage to our mouths and teeth can create complications that brushing and flossing alone cannot fix and for those issues restorative dentistry is the solutiondental bondingfillingsfillings are able to conceal visual evidence of cavities â the introduction and improvement of bonded tooth colored resin fillings has resulted in a product strong and stylish enough for teeth in the front areas of the mouth while people have benefited from the traditional amalgam fillings many have always felt selfconscious about the blackish silver metal that leaves a dark featureâ in the back of their mouths and which is often visible while talking or laughing therefore tooth colored resign fillings afford a preferableâ alternative to many individuals today and village dental offers this durable and indiscernible type of tooth restorationveneersrestore the
