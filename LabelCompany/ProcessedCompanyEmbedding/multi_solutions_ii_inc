inc by published june    pm et share edgar online via comtex  item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with multi solutions ii incs condensed financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this quarterly report on form q all statements in the following discussion that are not reports of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policy are forwardlooking statements please consider our forwardlooking statements in light of the factors that may affect operating results set forth herein overview our principal business objective for the next twelve months and beyond will be to achieve longterm growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate shortterm earnings our search for a business opportunity will not be limited to any particular geographical area or industry including both domestic and international companies we have negative working capital negative shareholders equity and have not earned any revenues from operations since  however we have issued an  revolving credit promissory note in favor of vector group ltd vector a majority shareholder in the principal amount of up to  as amended on june   which we believe provides us with access to sufficient capital for the next twelve months we are currently devoting our efforts to locating merger candidates our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to develop additional sources of capital locate and complete a merger with another company and ultimately achieve profitable operations our historical operating results disclosed in this form q are not meaningful to our future results we do not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow during the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to i investigating and analyzing business combinations ii filing of exchange act reports and iii consummating an acquisition we believe we will be able to meet these costs through amounts as needed to be lent by or invested in us by our shareholders management or other investors we may consider acquiring a business that has recently commenced operations a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets a company seeking to develop a new product or service or an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital in the alternative a business combination may involve the acquisition of or merger with a company that does not need substantial additional capital but desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding among other things the time delays significant expense and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering our management has not had any preliminary contact or discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth including entities without established records of sales or earnings in that event we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies in addition we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk and although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks our management anticipates that we will likely be able to effect only one business combination due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective shareholders which is likely to occur as a result of our managements plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a taxfree reorganization this lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another multi solutions ii inc we anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky because of general economic conditions rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital our management believes that there are firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include among other things facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex in order to minimize potential conflicts of interest which may arise because our directors and officers also serve as the directors and officers of multi soft ii inc an entity under common control each of our officers and directors has entered into an agreement with us and multi soft ii inc whereby they have each agreed that multi soft ii inc shall not analyze or consider any possible business combination opportunities until we have agreed to consummate a business combination if we consummate a business combination we will use our best efforts to have our stock quoted on the otc bulletin board the otcbb and anticipate that our common stock will be eligible to trade on the otcbb subsequent to such business combination in addition subsequent to such business combination we may seek the listing of our common stock on any of the several nasdaq markets or the nyse mkt either immediately after such business combination or sometime in the future however in  the nasdaq nyse and nyse mkt adopted a seasoning requirement for the listing of former reverse merger companies which includes trading in another market for an adequate period of time at certain minimum price levels with an adequate number of round lot shareholders and completing sec filings during this time although there is an exception to this requirement for firmly underwritten public offerings of at least  million we may be unable to comply with seasoning requirements for listing prior to the listing deadline and we may be unable to qualify for the  million exception which could adversely impact our ability to access us stock exchanges there can be no assurance that after we consummate a business combination we will be quoted on the otcbb or be able to meet the initial listing standards of any
