atrialonly fixation technology this novel technology is designed to eliminate the known issues of current transcatheter mitral valve replacement tmvr technologies which rely on placement and fixation in the native mitral annulus andor the left ventricle “we’re delighted with the interest in our company and our technology and we appreciate the leadership demonstrated by anges québec in this investment round” said robert thatcher president and ceo of c medical “we’re already ahead of schedule on our  targets by two quarters given how well things are going we’ve decided to get a jump on our  targets to finance our effort we announced last may that we planned to increase financing using convertible debt until we reached our usmillion goal with the support of anges québec we exceeded our goal proceeds from this round will go toward finalizing the technology to be used in our early human feasibility study in the us and perhaps japan” “the asymmetry of the native mitral annulus and the irregular shape of the valve leaflets considerably complicate the development of these technologies whose size and fixation mechanisms are tributary to unpredictable anatomical characteristics” explained dr jeffrey chambers md founder and chief medical officer of c medical millions of patients have mr and many don’t get proper treatment our mission is to develop a treatment that overcomes the problems associated with existing technologies with the support of our investors our team is entirely dedicated to this goal” mitral regurgitation mr is a common heart valve condition affecting

developing the first mr therapy that preserves the native mitral valve and left ventricle using a supraannular atrialonly fixation technology the novel design eliminates known issues of current transcatheter mitral valve replacement tmvr technologies which rely on placement and fixation in the native mitral annulus and left ventricle c medicals mitral valve is an innovative and simple solution for a very common problem and its unique mechanism will allow treatment of many patients not suitable for current tmvr devices said philippe généreux md day preclinical results are promising and demonstrate concept feasibility and safety with no hemodynamic compromise no thrombus and mildtono mr as confirmed by echocardiography dr généreux presented c medical valve a novel transcatheter mr treatment technology and facilitated subsequent roundtable discussions with audience qa he is codirector of the structural heart program at the gagnon cardiovascular institute of morristown medical center morristown nj and a practicing interventional cardiologist at hôpital du sacrécoeur de montréal montreal canada the main challenges encountered by current tmvr devices are related to the complexity of the mitral valve anatomy and the multitude of mr mechanisms said dr généreux with its supraannular position in the left atrium the c medical device preserves the native valve apparatus and avoids all issues related to the complexity and dynamism of the mitral annulus making the device suitable for patients independent of their mr mechanism this unique approach promotes healthy left ventricular remodeling and healing and eliminates the complications that are associated with current tmvr devices such as left ventricular outflow tract obstruction device embolization and early device fatigue failure we are dedicated to innovating therapies for structural heart disease through clinical research in partnership with key opinion leaders said robert thatcher ceo of c medical
