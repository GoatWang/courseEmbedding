chambers like so many powerful vocal artists can trace her love of music back to early childhood “i grew up singing in the church” she says not that she had to tell us citing the gospel influences of yolanda adams shirley caesar dottie peoples and whitney houston you can’t help but feel the spirit moving through the entire room when annika throws herself into the heart of a song but it was during her two tours of duty in the us army that chambers realized the gift she had “one of my colonels heard me singing and he said ‘why don’t you sing the anthem for one of our ceremonies’” she was an immediate hit and became their first choice for all their music events joining the gospel choir and even winning the talent show on her base from there chambers became part of a touring band making the rounds through kosovo and iraq providing a welcome lift for the troops’ morale she also planned special events concerts dances and karaoke nights always doing her part to infuse the good time

from her cds samantha fish  pm   pm main stage samantha fish spins you around with an emotional wild heart “she snarls it she spits it out and she could give a damn” goldmine produced by luther dickinson out on july th on ruf records rd studio release is filled up to the rim with staggering vocals aching guitar riffs and thunderous drums leaving you lifeless atlanta ga – on july th ruf records recording artist singerguitarist samantha fish will raise eyebrows with her third studio release wild heart produced by luther dickinson the north mississippi allstarsblack crowes having samantha on guitars and luther on various stringed instruments they rounded out the lineup with grammy awardwinning brady blade emmylou harrisbob dylan on drums special guests include lightnin malcolm guitar sharde thomas drums and memphis session singers shontelle normanbeatty and risse norman the result is a stunning representation of americana roots music wild heart was recorded in three different studios as they trekked the backroads from louisiana to mississippi in the fall of  starting at brady blade’s shreveport louisiana studio they laid the basic rhythm tracks and vocals luther and samantha then hightailed it to his zebra ranch studios in hernando mississippi where they had a traditional hill country blues session then finally all roads lead to memphis where the duo put the final touches at both willie mitchell’s royal studios and the legendary ardent studios “i fell in love with it” she told premier guitar of her growing passion for the form “and started doing my homework by listening to the old guys like son house and skip james” only into her mids she already released two cds played all over the world and shared the stage with wellestablished to the legendary artists from tab benoit and johnny lang to buddy guy label mate and sometimes touring buddy mike zito has long championed samantha produced her critically acclaimed albums runaway and black wind howlin’  samantha’s had a master’s class in a wide variety of the blues her work ethic is unquestioned and her love for performance is obvious boys will be boys it’s a powerful thing better learn how to swim or learn how to drink – bitch on the run all that ambition and passion paid off in  when samantha won a blues music award for best new artist debut for her  release runaway ruf records the wonderful critical praise winning fans at shows and all the long hours driving came to a shining moment that put more fuel into her fire this desire is now revealed with wild heart as the pivotal moment in her budding career always yearning to learn samantha soaked in this experience like a sponge from the songwriting sessions to the final background harmonies as her songs came together it was suggested for her to collaborate with another songwriter she jumped the opportunity last summer she traveled to nashville and wrote with accomplished songwriter jim mccormick whose songs have been cut by trisha yearwood and keith urban a native of new orleans jim has a flare for bluesboogie and full throttle vocalization to haunting melodies that gave samantha a chance to growl “… fish’s commanding voice holds its own against the crunching guitar riffs and driving beat” –elmore magazine samantha and jim wrote five of the  songs on the album including the title song “wild heart” that echoes led zeppelin with a whiplash of a steady guitar riff “show me” – a song that could easily be heard at some of new york city’s finest rock clubs – wreaks stale beer samantha holds her own on guitar duties on this tune as brady blade grinds the drums with a slow steady roll as the album opens she’s bashes away with “road runner“ a warning to others of this mean man that broke her heart the driving guitar sounds and thunderous beat supports her voice that is smooth as honey with a sad dash of salt left me waiting by a redlight i think about him every night road runner road runner – road runner after wrapping basic tracks it was off to dickinson’s zebra ranch studios via the back roads of mississippi seeing the culture and environment upfront got her excited for the unknown the result of that magical setting was a cover of charley patton’s “jim lee blues pt ” which fits fish’s voice it was an organic setting with fellow hill country blues artists sharde thomas and longtime friend lightnin malcolm sharde is a native mississippian fifedrum player in the same american tradition of her grandfather othar turner “this session had a whole other vibe to it the studio is out in the country no cell service no distractions you’re just surrounded by nature and guitars” beams samantha samantha’s love for the hill country blues genre started early on as her musical foundation began to build this fiery singersongwriter and guitarist met some of these players when she attended the king biscuit blues festival at age  there she met lightnin malcolm a guitarist who befriended the young gun and then a few years later at zebra ranch she got to record with him “working with malcolm was a longtime coming as i’d known him since i was a teenager hearing hill country blues made me fall in love with blues music and he was one of the first artists who let me jam with him” “one of my favorite songs on wild heart is ‘go home’ it became so powerful and we wanted girl power nofrills and those ladies delivered” samantha proudly states it’s a quiet moment of reflection of an inner self struggle that can either be destructive or productive the background singers shontelle normanbeatty and risse norman provide a soothing answer to samantha’s tearful call “maybe in a moment of clarity i’ll do what’s right maybe i’ll finally swallow a bit of my own advice” – go home oth samantha and luther wanted to make a live and honest record capturing fish’s emotional intensity and power trio integrity “she is so smart and talented it was a joy to take her under my wing and share what i’ve learned with her samantha brought her emotional energy from her performances which transcended into the record the songs are very personal and she delivered i am proud to be a part of the record” states dickinson samantha was equally satisfied with the results “i was blown away by his ability to color a song i stepped out of my comfort zone and i couldn’t be more proud of what we made” fish is an inveterate storyteller as well her songs are vivid and compelling with thick guitar lines and catchy riffs – the morning call as the album comes to a close samantha has run the gamut of emotions her fingers are tired and her voice is shaking but she is able to pull out one more gem of a performance a whispering rendition of rl burnside’s “i’m in love with you” this is samantha at her bestcaressing the melody while the guitars and a slight drum beat flickers underneath her reassuring voice samantha has dug her high heels in some rich musical soil with wild heart and is poised to reach a new level in her career she is armed with her guitar and these songs are in her back pocket for there is no doubt miss fish will aim and fire with confidence rod piazza  the mighty flyers  pm   pm main stage don’t make the mistake of thinking of rod piazza as one of the “young turks” of the blues or part of the “new generation” of blues greats at this point in his career piazza has been recording longer than his mentor george “harmonica” smith did or sonny boy williamson either of them or big walter horton he’s been making records for more years than little walter was alive piazza is a triedandtrue dyedinthewool blues veteran with credentials that are second to none from his first recordings as a leader in  fronting the dirty blues band through his multiple wc handy award winning with his current band the mighty flyers to his countless appearances both live and on record with legendary blues figures piazza has set a standard for harmonica virtuosity that has established him as one of the most influential living blues harp players he’s consistently surrounded himself with players who bring out the best he has to offer and epitomize the very best in blues fresh swinging tasteful exciting and creative the core of his band has been together for over three decades and developed the kind of musical telepathy that simply cannot exist without years of experience on the bandstand and in the studio the mighty flyers are a welloiled machine with piazza in the driver’s seat born in  piazza’s infatuation with blues began at a time when many of the masters were still in their prime years and in the mid s when the first blues revival was picking up steam he was in the thick of it by the s he’d already released five albums and was one of the leading lights of the west coast blues scene in the early ’s he joined forces with otis spann disciple honey alexander now his wife on piano and when they formed the mighty flyers over three decades ago his career really hit its stride since then piazza and the mighty flyers have won or been nominated for just about every award that can be bestowed upon a blues band played literally thousands of gigs around the world recorded over a dozen highly acclaimed releases and along the way virtually created a new style of blues – a combination of lowdown chicago grit suave west coast swing and jazz and the rhythmic drive of the best early rb and rock  roll quite simply rod piazza and the mighty flyers are one of the best most experienced and most distinctive bands in blues today kenny neal  pm   pm main stage if you

following year alligator records signed neal and reissued the debut under the title big news from baton rouge young neal was on his way neal’s sizzling guitar work sturdy harp and gravelly agedbeyondhisyears vocals served him well and he cut four albums for alligator records between  and  an acclaimed  stint on broadway in a production of mule bone found him performing acoustic versions of langston hughes’ poetry set to music by taj mahal in  neal moved from alligator to the blues division of the jazzbased telarc records releasing three albums for the label blues fallin’ down like rain  what you got  and one step closer  in the new millennium neal recorded sets for a variety of independent labels including easy meeting a  collaboration with billy branch double take  a oneshot
