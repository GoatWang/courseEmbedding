some of the most important akamantis aspelia kition khettiim makaria kryptos kypros khethima kyoforos alasia kerastis amathousia miionis sfikia kolinia tharsis aeria nea iousiniani in addition with cyprus many adjectives were closely associated like chalkoessa because of the copper veins asselia for its fishing activity iera nisos for the many saints evinos for the variety of wines eveleos for its olive oil and many olive trees dasoessa for its forest nisos eroron meaning island of love perikallis beautiful afrodisia island of aphrodite and a lot more islands name interpretation the current etymology of islands name has been portrayed variously by many specialists either ancient writers or presentday historians philologists linguists etymologists or other researchers there are five main interpretations of the origin of cyprus    from copper that was discovered on the island during the bronze period  bc  bc launching of copper mines and production represented a revolutionary and significant era in the history of cyprus  thanks to copper cyprus became a wellknown country at that time for the nearby countries the island and its strategic position at the crossroads of the mediterranean was remarkably attractive copper became a product that determined the raise of export and trade mycenean people who made their settlements in cyprus in the  th century bc were those firstly tempted by the copper trade and subsequently hellenized the island although the name kypros appeared in homeric times in  th century bc there is even an earlier evidence of the name according to knossos and pylos tablets from the  th century bc as a matter of fact cyprus belonged to the oldest copper producing countries in the near east and it is believed that this production was launched by the pregreek population as k hadjioannou asserts the word  kypros  meaning copper was a pregreek word and most likely an eteocypriot one eteocypriots were the aboriginal cypriots if this is true he concludes the name of island is justly derived from copper at present time the word copper which derived from the latin word  cuprum  has a similar form in many european languages english  copper german  kupfer french  cuivre swedish  koppar danish  kobber   from a plant called kypros henna  for a long period it was believed that cyprus acquired its name from a shrub called kypros  lawsonia alba  the plant which is native to north africa arabia persia and india has never been found in cyprus in a big number and today one can hardly find a shrub of kypros here it is rather odd that a relatively large island with such a rich history and a civilization dating back to a few millennia obtained its name from a nonnative shrub   from kypros the son or daughter of kinyras  relying on older sources evstathios claims that the name of the island is derived from kypros the son of kinyras while stephanos byzantios and k porphyrogennitos drawing from old sources as well ascribe the name to the daughter of kinyras kypros recorded by homer kinyras was a historical person but his genealogy is lost in the myths of antiquity what we learn from ancient writers including homer is that kirynas was the king of the whole cyprus not only the king of paphos as some sources declare it was a habitual matter to name the islands after the sons of kings mythological persons or some other personalities like samos mykonos paros naxos andros etc in greece  therefore it is no wonder that the son or daughter of the most renowned rich and eminent kings of cyprus is connected with the name of the island   from a town of cyprus named kypros  as claimed by onorios and isidoros the name of the island is derived from a town lying between kyrenia and akanthou now in north cyprus  however such a town has never been unearthed or historically traced and the probability of existence of such a town is minimal   from kypris a name which many of the ancient writers including homer gave to aphrodite  although a few writers believe that kypros  cyprus  owes its name to kypris aphrodite it is kypris that has derived the name from kypros  cyprus  as she was the goddess of kypros  cyprus
