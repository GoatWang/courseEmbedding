and forward contracts is determined by the various futures exchanges and reflects the settlement price for each contract as of the close of business on the last business day of the reporting period  the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of approximately  pm et of the last business day of the reporting

these contracts and the potential inability of counterparties to perform under the terms of the contracts  there are numerous factors which may significantly influence the fair value of these

determined  if an exchangetraded contract could not have been liquidated on such day due to the operation of daily limits or other rules of the exchange the settlement price will be equal to the

common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards “ifrss ”” the amendments within this asu change the wording used to describe many

of the amendments clarify the fasb’s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements and other amendments change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements the asu is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december   for public entities this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the partnership’s financial statements      income taxes no provision for income taxes has been made in the accompanying financial statements as limited partners are individually responsible for reporting income or loss based upon their respective share of the partnership’s revenues or expenses for income tax purposes  the partnership files us federal and state tax returns                      polaris futures fund lp formerly managed futures profile hv lp notes to financial statements concluded   the guidance issued by financial accounting standards board on income taxes clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the partnerships financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken  the partnership has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions that would require recognition in the financial statements as of june    if applicable the partnership recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in other expenses in the statements of income and expenses  generally the  through  tax years remain subject to examination by us federal and most state tax authorities  no income tax returns are currently under examination      subsequent events management of ceres performed its evaluation of subsequent events through the date of filing and has determined that there were no subsequent events requiring adjustment of or disclosure in the financial statements                            item   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations     liquidity   msco and its affiliates act as custodians of each trading company’s assets pursuant to customer agreements and foreign exchange customer agreement  the partnership allocates substantially all of its assets to multiple trading companies such assets are deposited in the trading companies’ trading accounts with msco or its affiliates  the funds in such accounts are available for margin and are used to engage in futures interest trading pursuant to instructions provided by the trading advisors  the assets are held in either noninterest bearing bank accounts or in securities and instruments permitted by the commodity futures trading commission for investment of customer segregated or secured funds  since the partnership’s sole purpose is to trade futures interests indirectly through the investment in the trading companies it is expected that the trading companies will continue to own such liquid assets for margin purposes   the trading companies’ investment in futures interests may from time to time be illiquid  most us futures exchanges limit fluctuations in prices during a single day by regulations referred to as “daily price fluctuation limits” or “daily limits”  trades may not be executed at prices beyond the daily limit  if the price for a particular futures or options contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit positions in that futures or options contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit  futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading  these market conditions could prevent the trading companies from promptly liquidating their futures or options contracts and result in restrictions on redemptions                      there is no limitation on daily price moves in trading forward contracts on foreign currencies  the markets for some world currencies have low trading volume and are illiquid which may prevent the trading companies from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the trading companies from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such markets subjecting them to substantial losses  either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on redemptions  for the periods covered by this report illiquidity has not materially affected the partnership’s assets   there are no known material trends demands commitments events or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to result in the partnership’s liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way   capital resources   the partnership does not have nor does it expect to have any capital assets  redemptions exchanges and sales of units in the future will affect the amount of funds available for investments in futures interests in subsequent periods  it is not possible to estimate the amount and therefore the impact of future inflows and outflows of units   there are no known material trends favorable or unfavorable that would affect nor any expected material changes to the partnership’s capital resource arrangements at the present time   results of operations general   the partnership’s results depend on the trading advisors and the ability of each trading advisor’s trading program to take advantage of price movements in the futures forward and options markets  the following presents a summary of the partnership’s operations for the three and six month periods ended                  june   and  and a general discussion of its trading activities during each period  it is important to note however that the trading advisors trade in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the trading advisors or will be profitable in the future  consequently the results of operations of the partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of the trading advisors’ trading activities on behalf of the partnership during the period in question  past performance is no guarantee of future results   the partnership’s results of operations set forth in the financial statements on pages  through  of this report are prepared in accordance with us gaap which require the use of certain accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements including the following  the contracts the trading companies trade are accounted for on a tradedate basis and marked to market on a daily basis  the difference between their original contract value and fair value is recorded on the statements of income and expenses as “net change in unrealized gain loss” for open contracts and recorded as “realized trading gain loss” when open positions are closed out  the sum of these amounts constitutes the trading company’s trading results  the fair value of a futures contract is the settlement price on the exchange on which that futures contract is traded on a particular day  the value of a foreign currency forward contract is based on the spot rate as of approximately  pm et the close of the business day   for the three and

partnership’s assets are subject to the risk of trading loss through its investments in the trading companies each of which invests substantially all of its assets in the trading program of an unaffiliated trading advisor the marketsensitive instruments held by the trading companies are acquired for speculative trading purposes and substantially all of the respective trading companies’ assets are subject to the risk of trading loss  unlike an operating company the risk of marketsensitive instruments is integral not incidental to the trading companies’ main line of business   the futures forwards and options traded by the trading companies involve varying degrees of related market risk  market risk is often dependent upon changes in the level or volatility of interest rates exchange rates and prices of financial instruments and commodities  these factors result in frequent changes in the fair value of the trading companies’ open positions and consequently in their earnings whether realized or unrealized and cash flow  gains and losses on open positions of exchangetraded futures exchangetraded forward and exchangetraded futuresstyled options contracts are settled daily through variation margin  gains and losses on offexchangetraded forward currency contracts and forward currency options contracts are settled upon termination of the contract  however the trading companies are required to meet margin requirements equal to the unrealized loss on open forward currency contracts in the trading companies’ accounts with the counterparty which is accomplished by daily maintenance of the cash balance in a custody account held at mssb for the benefit of msco                    the total market risk of the respective trading companies may increase or decrease as it is influenced by a wide variety of factors including but not limited to the diversification among the trading companies’ open positions the volatility present within the markets and the liquidity of the markets   the face value of the market sector instruments held by the trading companies is typically many times the applicable margin requirements  margin requirements generally range between  and  of contract face value  additionally the use of leverage causes the face value of the market sector instruments held by the trading companies typically to be many times the total capitalization of the trading companies   the partnership’s and the trading companies’ past performance are no guarantee of their future results  any attempt to numerically quantify the trading companies’ market risk is limited by the uncertainty of their speculative trading  the trading companies’ speculative trading and use of leverage may cause future losses and volatility  ie

provided for such statements by the private securities litigation reform act of  set forth in section a of the securities act                of  and section e of the securities exchange act of  all quantitative disclosures in this section are deemed to be forwardlooking statements for purposes of the safe harbor except for statements of historical fact   the trading companies account for open positions on the basis of mark to market accounting principles any loss in the market value of the trading companies’ open positions is directly reflected in the trading companies’ earnings and cash flow   the trading companies’ risk exposure in the market sectors traded by the trading advisors is estimated below in terms of var  var for a particular market sector is estimated by ceres using a model based upon historical simulation with a confidence level of  which involves constructing a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the value of a trading portfolio  the var model takes into account linear exposures to risks including equity and commodity prices interest rates foreign exchange rates and correlation among these variables  the hypothetical daily changes in the value of a trading company’s portfolio are based on daily percentage changes observed in key market indices or other market factors “market risk factors” to which the portfolio is sensitive the oneday  confidence level of the trading companies’ var corresponds to the reliability of the expectations that the trading company’s trading losses in one day will not exceed the maximum loss indicated by the var  the  oneday confidence level is not an indication of probability of such losses nor does var typically represent the worst case outcome  ceres uses approximately four years of daily market data

incorporating a range of varied market risks reflect risk reduction due to portfolio diversification or hedging activities and can cover a wide range of portfolio assets  however var risk measures should be viewed in light of the methodology’s limitations which include but may not be limited to the following ·   past changes in market risk factors will not always result in accurate predictions of the distributions and correlations of future market movements ·   changes in portfolio value caused by market movements may differ from those of the var model ·   var results reflect past market fluctuations applied to current  trading positions while future risk depends on future positions ·   var using a oneday time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged within one day and ·   the historical market risk factor data used for var estimation may provide only limited insight into losses that could be incurred under certain unusual market movements   in addition the var tables above as well as the past performance of the partnership and the trading companies give no indication of the partnership’s potential “risk of ruin”              the var tables provided present the results of the partnership’s var for each of the trading companies’ market risk exposures and on an aggregate basis at june   and december   and for the four quarterend reporting periods from july   through june   and from january   through december   respectively  var is not necessarily representative of the trading companies’ historic risk nor should it be used to predict the partnership or the trading companies’ future financial performance or their ability to manage or monitor risk there can be no assurance that the trading companies’ actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the var amounts indicated above or that such losses will not occur more than once in  trading days   nontrading risk the trading companies have nontrading market risk on their foreign cash balances these balances and any market risk they may represent are immaterial   the trading companies also maintain a substantial portion of their available assets in cash

approximately  of boronia i llc’s net assets ·   approximately  of ahl i llc’s net assets     a decline in shortterm interest rates would result in a decline in the trading companies’ cash management income  this cash flow risk is not considered to be material    materiality as used throughout this section is based on an assessment of reasonably possible market movements and any associated
