vietnamese vô vi english lit nondoing is an important concept in taoism that literally means nonaction or nondoing in the tao te ching lao tzu explains that beings or phenomena that are wholly in harmony with the tao behave in a completely natural uncontrived way the goal of spiritual practice for the human being is according to lao tzu the attainment of this purely natural way of behaving as when the planets revolve around the sun the planets effortlessly do this revolving without any sort of control force or attempt to revolve themselves instead engaging in effortless and spontaneous movement sinologist herrlee creel considered wu wei a distinguishing factor despite no political separation until after the early han dynasty between more purposive religious taoism having its beginnings in governmental huanglao and emphasizing a striving for immortality and the philosophical taoism of the zhuangzi which emphasizes wu wei in the sense of not striving often considering the search for immortality secondary laughable or harmful contents  definition  taoist usage  early development and political usage  see also  references  external links definitionedit sinologist herrlee creel writes that wu wei as found in the tao te ching and zhuangzi seems to denote two different things  an attitude of genuine nonaction motivated by a lack of desire to participate in human affairs and  a technique by means which the one who practices it may gain enhanced control of human affairs the first is quite in line with the contemplative taoism of the zhuangzi described as a source of serenity in taoist thought only rarely do taoist texts suggest that ordinary people could gain political power through wu wei and in the zhuangzi does not seem to indicate a definitive philosophical idea simply that the sage does not occupy himself with the affairs of the world the second sense appears to have been imported from the earlier governmental thought of legalist shen buhai  bc – c  bc as taoists became more interested in the exercise of power by the ruler called rule by nonactivity and strongly advocated by han fei during the han dynasty up until the reign of han wudi rulers confined their activity chiefly to the appointment and dismissal of his high officials a plainly legalist practice inherited from the qin dynasty this conception of the rulers role as a supreme arbiter who keeps the essential power firmly in his grasp while leaving details to ministers has a deep influence on the theory and practice of chinese monarchy only appearing three times in the first more contemplative half of the zhuangzi early taoists may have avoided the term for its association with legalism before ultimately coopting its governmental sense as well as attempted in the zhuangzis latter half thought by modern scholarship to have been written after the zhuangzi wu wei occurs as a major concept in the more purposive taoism of the tao te ching in which the taoist seeks to use his power to control and govern the world creel taoist usageedit in the taoist texts wu wei   is often associated with water and its yielding nature in illustration it can assume any form or shape it inhabits wu may be translated as not have or without wei may be translated as do act serve as govern or effort the literal meaning of wu wei is without action without effort or without control and is often included in the paradox wei wu wei action without action or effortless doing the practice of wu wei and the efficacy of wei wu wei are fundamental tenets in chinese thought and have been mostly emphasized by the taoist school one cannot actively pursue wu wei it manifests as a result of cultivation the tao is a guide there is another less commonly referenced sense of wu wei action that does not involve struggle or excessive effort in this instance wu means without and wei means effort the concept of effortless action is a part of taoist internal martial arts such as tai chi chuan baguazhang and xing yi it follows that wu wei complies with the distinguishing feature of taoism that of being natural in zen calligraphy wu wei has been represented as an ensō circle in china the calligraphic inscriptions of the words wu wei themselves resonate with old taoist storiesclarification needed several chapters of the most important taoist text the tao te ching attributed to laozi allude to diminishing doing or diminishing will as the key aspect of the sages success taoist philosophy recognizes that the universe already works harmoniously according to its own ways as a person exerts their will against or upon the world they disrupt the harmony that already exists this is not to say that a person should not exert agency and will rather it is how one acts in relation to the natural processes already existent the how the tao of intention and motivation that is key related translation from the tao tê ching by priya hemenway chapter ii  the sage is occupied with the
