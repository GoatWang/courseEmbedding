relationship and bond you get with your other coworkersconswhat isnt a con their bcbas have no clue what theyre doing they have turned away children for being too aggressive instead of helping them overcome behaviors they expect therapists to design the childrens programs when they dont have the background support or training to do so the children do not progress and their goals merely confuse them because they make no sense ex a child has no attending skills and cant attend to their own name but yet they have a goal to receptively id a picture on a table of a random item like a car it doesnt make sense the bcbas reinforce bad behaviors you dont get breaks to eat and the company only gives a few cent raises every year the new people coming in are at a much lower rate of pay than older employees because they choose quantity over quality in their employees since ive left theyre firing all the old employees and seems like its because they are tired of paying them a higher pay rate they try to come after people after they leave for the noncompete clause which is void because they didnt sign it in the first placeadvice to managementquit ruining the lives of children and

different every single day the job of working with kiddos makes everyday exciting and newconsone con of working at hopebridge is that breaks can be hard to come by depending on what kind of day your

also room to shine since last year when i joined those who do a good job appear to be awarded with more responsibilityconsthe business is growing fast which causes stress juggling dozens of tasks sometimes causes the right hand to not know for a day or two what the left hand is trying to accomplish miscommunication not awful though management tends to be pretty good about doing periodic updates or reevaluations to keep everything in focus and they dont shift blame on occasional lapsesadvice to managementnone at the moment management works hard and pays attention most inconveniences that have occurred seem linked to unusually high levels of activityworkload and the miscommunications that stem from having so many distractionsquick note my no opinion rating for the ceo is not based on anything negative  merely that my sphere of influence is too far removed from him to give a good estimation but he seems to be very competent and the business seems to be doing wellshare on

hopebridge for a year and half ive been witness to a lot of pros within the company accessibility to executive management has been incredibly beneficial both as a therapist during meet and eat meetings and as a manager within the clinic ive witnessed changes occur in response to specific feedback from current employees the company offers a very competitive wage with opportunities for multiple bonuses and full benefits paid time off is also available upon start without having to earn your time off the company has a solid business model led by individuals with a background in building successful businesses in order to provide effective therapy and continue to treat patients the doors have to stay open and i never worry about that within this company access to experts in the field helps assure effective treatment and problem solve when a patient does not exhibit the desired trajectory the consulting bcbad on staff is incredibly helpful accessible knowledgeable and encouraging offering education to the staff as a means of finding a solution to creating more effective treatment protocols he pushes the clinicians to grow their knowledge without leading them directly to the answerconsthe company is experiencing astounding growth and with growth often comes growing pains my only cons to date would be some discrepancies within the recruiting department and
