offering our management however will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply the net proceeds of this offering if an unforeseen event occurs or business conditions change we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as described in this prospectus to the extent that the net proceeds we receive from this offering are not immediately used for the above purposes we intend to invest our net proceeds in shortterm interestbearing bank deposits or debt instruments in utilizing the proceeds of this offering as an offshore holding company of our prc subsidiary we may i make loans to our prc subsidiary and affiliated entities ii make additional capital contributions to our prc subsidiary iii establish new prc subsidiaries and make capital contributions to these new prc subsidiaries and iv acquire offshore entities with business operations in china in an offshore transaction however most of these uses are subject to prc regulations and approvals for example • loans by us to our whollyowned subsidiary in china which is a foreigninvested enterprise cannot exceed statutory limit and must be registered with safe or its local counterparts the statutory limit for the total amount of foreign debt to be incurred by a foreigninvested enterprise is the difference between the amount of total investment as approved by the ministry of commerce or its local counterpart and the amount of registered capital of such foreigninvested enterprise for example the current amounts of approved total investment and registered capital of hailiang consulting are us million and us million respectively this means hailiang consulting cannot obtain loans in excess of us million from entities outside of china however we may from time to time further increase such statutory limit by making additional capital contributions and increase the total investment amount to hailiang consulting thereby increasing the statutory limit of the loans hailiang consulting may obtain in the future based on our operational needs • loans by us to our affiliated entities which are domestic prc entitiesover a certain threshold must be approved by the relevant government authorities and must also be registered with safe or its local counterparts and • capital contributions to our whollyowned subsidiary must be approved by the mofcom or its local counterparts we intend to use the majority of proceeds from this offering for acquisitions although we are not currently negotiating any acquisitions in addition to acquisitions we currently expect that a portion of the proceeds of this offering

improvements at our schools marketing to enhance our brand recruitment of additional administrative staff and enhancement of our information technology systems these uses of proceeds are for purposes within the business scope of hailiang consulting hailiang consulting received the necessary approvals from the relevant prc regulatory authority to include leasehold improvements within its business scope in october  meanwhile we believe that our affiliated entities will have adequate cash from their operations to support their own operation and expansion however if needed we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the government registrations or approvals required to transfer offering proceeds to our prc subsidiaries or affiliated entities on a timely basis if at all if we fail to satisfy these requirements on a timely basis our ability to remit the funds received from this offering to capitalize our prc operations may be negatively affected which could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business the k educational services market in china is rapidly evolving highly fragmented and competitive according to the ccid report the total number of private k schools has increased steadily from  in  to  in  the proportion of students in private k schools against the total number of students in k schools also increased from  to  during the same period however in  the top six private schools in china including our company only enrolled  of the total private school students in china according to the ccid report because the market share of private k schools is relatively small compared to that of public schools our primary competitors are public k schools in areas where we recruit our students with respect to our basic educational program currently our major competitor in zhuji is zhuji no  middle school with respect to our international program currently our major competitors are hangzhou no  middle school’s ap center the affiliated high school of hangzhou normal university international department and hangzhou foreign language school we also face competition from zhuji ronghuai school which is the secondlargest private school in zhuji where our three schools are located as we continue to grow our business through expansion and acquisitions we also expect to face competition from k schools both private and public located in other geographic regions where we will establish or acquire additional k schools we believe that the competition in the k educational services market is generally based on school brand student academic performance parent satisfaction quality of teachers campus size and tuition fees we expect competition to persist and intensify we believe that we are able to compete effectively because of our strong brand recognition and established international program however some of our existing and potential competitors especially public schools may have access to resources that we do not have some of these competitors particularly public schools have governmental support in forms of government subsidies and other payments or fee reductions these competitors may devote greater resources financial or otherwise than we can to student recruitment campus development and brand promotion and respond more quickly than we can to changes in student demands and market needs
