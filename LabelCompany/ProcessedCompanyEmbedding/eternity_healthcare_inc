health  share on facebook tweet on twitter bio x supplement review bio x is a proprietary digestive enzyme blend consisting of a in weight loss supplement that utilizes the power of probiotics as well as more inherently traditional weight loss ingredients to help you lose weight faster and more efficient who is nucific  dr amy lee bio x is manufactured by nucific inc who is located in tarzana california their entire presentation behind the nucific bio x is headed and lead by dr amy lee a certified bariatric physician whose lifetime work specializes in internal medicine and physical nutrition she is the founder and director at the integrated wellness center in los angeles ca and has prestigious degrees from the american board of internal medicine national board of physician nutrition specialists nbpns and american board of obesity medicine if you have watched the bio x video in its entirety which we strongly recommend – and has been viewed well over  times you will find her healthy weight management approach is rooted on avoiding  harmful foods that we should all stop consuming and using on a daily basis along with adding her  natural weight loss boosters and digestion helpers her first major harmful health food was sugarladen yogurt her second major harmful health food was highfructose corn syrup hfcs wheat beard her third major harmful health food was sugar and hfcs cereal bars she also gave way to her number one carbohydrate to avoid in olestraolean banned in canada china and europe which was created by proctor  gamble to be a calorie and cholesterol fat free substitute  she was quick to point out that carbs gluten and sweets are okay to eat in moderation but to completely stay away from soda pop and even diet sodas again we highly recommend you watch and review the nucific bio x video to gather all the facts and figures doctor amy expresses and warns about lets continue to discuss the details of the core message behind the video and that is digestive health and wellness and how bio x and potentially help solve these ongoing problems how does bio x work in her  harmful foods dr amy lee had a quote worth remembering in saying “your digestive system can either make you energy or it can make you fat but it cannot make you both” so what is her proactive digestion solution according to nucific there are four main ingredients in bio x which the official website says is a one of a kind revolutionary formula consisting of  proven nutrients that support digestive aid and effective weight loss management these ingredients include — digestive enzymes that “maximize the amount of nutrients you absorb out of everything you eat” —  billion “colonyforming units” of probiotics which help to rebalance your digestive gi tract with healthy bacteria in the gut which promotes regular bowel movements and immune health — caralluma fimbriata extract which acts as a natural appetite suppressant and improves your mood — egcg which is sourced from pure green tea extract to help increase your metabolism so you can burn more fat combined these four ingredients work together to help support your digestive system while simultaneously helping you lose weight each of these four ingredients was specially designed to help you with one of these two goals which is why nucific biox probiotics are so effective does bio x really work bio x’s ingredients actually do have some clinical data to back up their claims caralluma fimbriata extract for example has been clinically proven to help suppress appetite and to improve mood eccg is also one of the most well known metabolism boosters and since the ecgc found in bio x is directly extracted from green tea extract it is ultra concentrated to help give you a true boost in your metabolism we haven’t found out much documentation for the “digestive enzymes”  but we did find that many strains of probiotics found in bio x are proven to help support digestive functions and may help calm your digestive system and relieve diarrhea or constipation benefits of bio x so what exactly can bio x do for you here are the benefits that nucific claims bio x can provide you — improved digestion — decreased appetitefood cravings — faster metabolism for safe weight loss — restoration of healthy gut bacteria — improved mood — increased energy levels — plus much more side effects of bio x according to nucific bio x has no known side effects and it is made up of pure ingredients they manufacture supplements that are both glutenfree and allergenfree and their products do not contain any filler ingredients whatsoever the only warning bio x gives is that people taking antidepressants should be wary about using bio x because it contains caralluma fimbriata extract which may cause mood swings if you are taking common antidepressants if you are on an antidepressant then it’s recommended you ask your doctor whether or not bio x is right for you buying nucifics bio x probiotic supplement you can buy bio x online or directly on the nucific website there are three different packages offered for bio x that you can choose from — one bottle day supply  — three bottles day supply  – you save  — six bottles  day supply  – you save  no matter which order you purchase you are protected with a day money back guarantee and can even find it on amazoncom if for any reason you are dissatisfied with your order of bio x then you can return your bottle and receive a full refund for your purchase final thoughts on bio x there’s a lot to like about bio x not only does bio x contains ingredients that are proven to provide the benefits they claim but bio x is also dosed properly to help you maximize the benefits you experience while taking the supplement it may not be the more affordable product but bio x is arguably much more effective and safer compared to other products we’ve tested bio x is a home run we definitely think that bio x can definitely provide you with the weight loss benefits you desire   related reviewsmore from author decabolic creatine – nutracell labs anabolic testosterone boost pure testo booster – natural testosterone male

nutraglow – super lean  super b sublingual vitamins drops  comments a dr gundry is pushing prebiotics what is the difference between that and probiotic that you are handling i’ll save everyone the time of watching “dr” amy lee’s longwinded videos and wasting money on their supplements here it is eat foods from around the “outside” of the grocery store fresh produce meats and lowfat dairy in moderation and multigrain breads in moderation and avoid processedprepackaged foods from the aisles that’s it not a popular sales pitch because there’s no money to be made in it but that’s all you need to know have good day clarification when i say “meats” i mean lean meats in moderation eat all the fresh produce you can especially cruciferous and leafy greens i prefer organic for fruitsvegetables that you don’t peal organicgrass fed for meats free rangeorganic for eggs limit your intake of saturated fatscholesterol if you have high blood cholesterol to me sugar artificial sweeteners refinedsimple carbs are the  thing to avoid if i really need something sweet i go for some fruit or  juices mixed with a little water andor some other kind of juice that is really lowsugar like ‘pure’ blueberry or even pure cranberry which is only  grams of sugar per glass also eat slowly and only until you’re satisfied easy on the chip and fries substitute veggies for fries when you eat out salad over soup etc basically “make good decisions” and of course get all the physical activity you can… take the stairs walk the long way to work or to the water cooler park farther away from the store if you sit for a living set a reminder to get up once every  minutes or more do some jumping jacks in the morning and at night etc etc etc be active exactly the info she gives is worth knowing though when we know the why… it gives the solution more priority i completely agree first i question the fact that this ms lee is not reachable by phone address or email address there’s a question for you sherlock when it sounds too good to be true…you got it it probably is too good to be true how sad she gave a good presentation…good luck ms lee just don’t like folks giving me part of any information i like it all and really like to be able to contact the person making such claims ill pass hi – would anyone know if biox is available in australia and if so where can i get it thanks in advance i’m hesitant to mention my results because no one has mentioned anything even related to my experience i have taken the biox for eleven days now and starting with day two my life has changed i woke up with a start wondering what was wrong and realized i slept the entire night without getting up to take a whiz and i wasn’t needing to run to the bathroom in the past i have been experiencing some painful urination that has went away can u tell me if theres any connection with the biox or is it something else i do take two different medicines for my prostrate bob e that is an entirely plausible effect bob i am just reading through all this to see if i want to recommend this product to my clients who i council on true nutrition and using real food and superfoods to bring about health even from a disease state such as stage  cancer i recommend several of the ingredients in this product in addition to many dietary intake changes that she did not cover this product will undoubtedly decrease inflammation and aid in digestion of proteins which will increase your nutrient absorption and help your body create the substrates that make it work properly there is a lot of science that she does not cover but what she does cover is accurate as far as i can see she is long winded but it seems that there is a necessity to this as there is so much that the average person does not know i would leave you my website to check out more what i teach but i don’t know if that is allowed if you want it reply to me and i will tell you  deanna exercise physiologist clinical weight loss and nutrition specialist i called there number advertised  and recording says changed to  and its some directory research program need to speak with live person on this product anyone been able to contact customer service should not be this hard makes me thing company is a sham and shady has anyone else been able to contact customer representative and at what phone  allison it’s  not  i am sensitive to most foods and supplements but this product seems fine please consider making it without the green tea extract and clearly state the caffeine content per pill hi i’m about to order this product and i just read a bunch of comments i would like to point out that you lovely ladies need to stop looking at the scale it’s basically a liar what you need to focus on is your inches and how you’re digestionelimination is reacting apart of the product is turning your fat into muscle cells and muscle actually weighs more than fat so do not be discouraged when you see no difference on the scale throw the damn thing away and focus on your inches and your digestion i’m super excited to start using this product and i’m going to share this with my mother who’s had lots of difficulty with hormonal imbalance which i think is coming from her diet and stress wish us luck fat does not turn into muscle fat cells can shrink or be removed through liposuction but they cannot be turned into muscle muscle cells are formed by germ cells in a process known as myogenesis muscle velopment occurs through exercise not by using this product this product contains nothing that grows muscles or transforms fat into muscles furthermore hormone imbalances need to be treated by physical exercise diet and traditional medicine if the first  aren’t helping if your mother has hormonal imbalance it could be caused by something physically wrong with her body like with polycystic ovary syndrome this product will not help with a hormonal imbalance again that’s something that must be treated with diet exercise and traditional medicine if the first  aren’t working there is nothing in this product that will help with hormonal imbalances i truly hope you research items like this product before trying to treat a medical problem this comment is not fully correct candida can most definitely cause hormonal imbalance candida usually begins in the gut and can be amplified by poor diet and poor digestion parasites can also cause horrible hormonal imbalance those usually begin in the gut as well… so the statement “there is nothing in this product that will help with hormonal imbalances” is very incorrect if it helps with digestion it can help with hormonal imbalances i agree with you   robin demio 😊 i did try it and it didn’t work for me i actually gained two pounds and have had stomach cramps that i never had previously in addition don’t rely on their “moneyback guarantee” i sent them an email and they have not responded just read this i have not tried the product yet but have done my own reasearch and there is nothing in it other than a small amount of caffeine in the green tea that may cause you any problem any program that is geared at changing your body and digestive track can cause some discomfort over the first month and will sometimes take up to  months to see results that you like thats why most products and even exercise compainies always say  days second i would recommend calling them to get the refund then you can record a name and time and date that you called for help nucific’s customer service department at   in order to request a refundhere is the number that they say to call you will get your money back if you truly do not think it is working but i would recommend giving it longer than a  day trial also you do and should be making changes to what you eat along the way you can’t keep eating the same junk and expect a change you will only get the same results that you have always had nucific’s customer service department at  or email protected in order to request a refund hi everyone…i’m still going strong and sugar free…i don’t crave sweets and is not a problem and not tempted by sweets desserts and pass up all birthday party cakes… i have my  cacao and organic dates to satisfy me my weight is still going up and down and bloating is better weigh in this morning was  yet i am losing inches went from a size to a size  which was shocking since my weight doesn’t move much haven’t measured myself funny my weight loss is very slow but inches are coming off now taking the biox faithfully x’s per day being sugar free vegetarian and taking the biox one would think the pounds would be dropping but it’s true that slower is better… patience is a virtue hope to hear how everyone is doing much respect to all questions are welcomed best wishes haven’t seen any other comments from you it is now march  – what are your thoughts on biox now thanks mary ellen hi roxie it’s been about  months since your last post an update on your results is greatly appreciated thank you and god bless hello everyone… caroline have you lost any weight at all in  months or are you not checking your weight i’ve been using my bio x for just over a month started it september th last night i has a severe reaction to eating cumin i’m already deathly allergic to garlic  cilantro and now cumin i put it in my black bean dip i made i’m in hopes biox will change my allergy issue with my stomach but not holding my breath i nearly died last night was  minutes before i was found son said i stopped breathing twice he got me breathing again  was there pretty fast as of this morning my weight was  …started at  … my bloating went down first day but came right back and my weight as well kept going back up i quit sugar consumption about a month before i started the biox and also became a vegetarian… so i’m not sure which is working for me my stomach is tore up from the allergy reaction last night the attacks are extremely painful and a pain like no other i have been faithfully taking my bio x…  times a day i plan to remain sugar free and vegetarian… the only thing that keeps me from keep being a vegan is i’m eating eggs once a week i don’t eat any dairy i use almond cheese best wishes to all if youre allergic to cilantro you shouldn’t eat cumin i’m fairly certain cumin is just the dried form of cilantro best of luck thank you cori…yeah i learned it the hard way i had to do research on it coriander is the dried seed of cilantro not cumin cori i believe you are referring to coriander if you are allergic to cilantro coriander and cilantro are basically the same thing cumin has nothing to do with cilantro cumin is part of the parsley family and its “seeds” are actually the dried fruit of the plant ground cumin is the seeds in powder form the most commonly sold powder is made from amber cumin seeds as opposed to white or black coriander is the seed of the cilantro plant i have been using the biox for about  months now i am not sure if it is helping me lose weight but it has done amazing things for my digestive track i used to have many digestive issues that disappear as long as i am taking the biox if i stop taking it for a few days the problems return which is how i know the biox is the key i find that i get the advantages by taking just  or  pills a day perhaps if i took the full dose i would experience the weight loss benefits… hi everyone…was away for weekend so wasn’t able to weigh in…they say don’t weigh in often but…i do anyway friday sept th was last weigh in…keep in mind that i cook and prep my own meals that are organic vegetablesfruits best for collagenelasticity building so my body will shrink with me…just makes sense to me i drink mass amounts of water…chug  cups per day…i keep track to make sure i drink enough i consume  tablespoons of organic blackstrap molasses unfiltered…every morning…keep in mind i don’t consume any sugar…or preservatives…research it and you will learn it’s benefits not saying you have too take it too…i do for me i’m a researcher type so i research what i consume taking my biox as instructed i do find my body is lacking enough calcium so had to start taking my coral calcium to help out reminder…i’m age  ′ ″ my biox start weight was  sept th… my weigh in this morning was  sept th…hang in there everyone and remember…it can take  to  days everyone is different and eats different so…listen to your body it will give into you… so feed it right and research i eat organic vegetablesfruits best for collagen elasticity building…reminder…to drink at least  cups of water per day look forward to hearing about your journey roxie s hi everyone…well went to a fabric store and bought a tape measure yesterday…i’ve never measured myself before rather shocking seeing my size lol i’ve not been able to lose my bloat in my belly for awhile…i’ve been frustrated over it drinking mass water didn’t even help i noticed a difference when i woke up belly bloat down   inches i can breathe better even i’m so looking forward to ending my bloat situation and seems to be happening over night with the biox and supplement i’m so hoping it helps with my food allergies and rashes i’ve been getting… it seems that i’ve become sensitive to many things by the way i didn’t mention i’m ’″ and my weigh in was  on my scale this morning yesterday was  i sure didn’t expect it to see it go down overnight look forward to seeing what more happens best wishes hi everyone…very excited…i finally received my biox it also has a supplement with it which i didn’t understand came with it it didn’t come with any instructions so i had to call and ask from what the representative told me on the phone i take  biox  times per day and  per day of the supplement wash them down with  cups of water about me…i’m  and weigh  at my scale this morning i do understand it can take  to  days before i may notice… i am the most patient person you’ll ever meet i stopped eating sugar a while back and i feel so much better now i have gave up my organic honey as well…i used it in my coffee i seemed to be packing on the pounds… i had made it my sugar substitute and found out that was a mistake by my scale going up it didn’t take me long to stop craving sugar but i am human and i do love my  cacao dark chocolate and eat it with a bite of organic dates to keep my sanity… after all i am human i also follow a diet that contains what i need to gain back my collagen and elasticity which are certain fruits and vegetables which is good to research which i feel is clever for me to gain back my collagen and elasticity look forward to following your journey as well best wishes i love your review and comments thank you john s hi john s thank you…will post more hopefully soon have you started the the biox as well would love to follow your story support is always a good thing roxie s hi everyone i’ve been doing a lot of research and i really like all i’ve read on biox i’ve ordered my supply and exited to start and see what it does for me i finally got my willpower and no longer use sugar and eating lots of portabella mushrooms…lost  pounds in  weeks just with that change i’m deathly allergic to garlic and cilentro and i have to do my own cooking which is a plus keeping me away from garlic and deadly preservatives i’m hoping it will fix my issues and be lucky enough to rid of all my allergies…time will tell…i ordered a big supply so just waiting on the delivery i will be honest and state my age…weight and have you follow me here if you like when i start…so i look forward to this journey and your journey as well i take fluvoxamine is that okay with bio x i have taken the bio x since december  at first i noticed the loss of appetite and feeling like i didn’t enjoy eating however i believe my body became resistant to the supplement and  pills a day was not enough just eat less and enjoy life i started taking it beginning of may and wasn’t really paying much attention to the results because to be honest i haven’t had much luck with anything up until now and didn’t expect the miracle it was promising i do believe in probiotics and have been taking them off and on for at least years so i figured it couldn’t hurt since i was already spending cash towards similar products for the benefits they give to my digestive system well about in the middle of june i started to realize i was losing weight my pants were actually falling down and i had to get a smaller size out which i haven’t been in for a long time i have been under a lot of stress because of my sister losing her battle with aggressive ms and my need to be with her almost daily also the fact that we got “rats” in our house and have been fighting to get rid of them for over three months still have one left…the mother and we are hoping that we got the male before she was pregnant again i know sickening and i never thought i would have this problem anyway the reason i shared that is because i wanted to make the point that usually i gain when i am stressed out not this time i actually went from my size ’s and some  pants… down to size  and some ’s  excites me a lot i had done all the things it suggests before the drinking of more water and not eating the foods that are the no no’s but i would not lose weight i messed my metabolism up in my early ’s going on a very low calorie diet just to get back to  lbs for my husband… from my “enormously gross”  when i come off the  calorie diet i found i could not hardly eat anything extra without gaining add to the situation i was unable to exercise the way i had because of some medical problems i still cannot exercise the way i would love to and i haven’t changed that either while i have been taking biox i have no other explanation except that with god’s help and this product i have now lost a good many pounds i am not sure what i was when i started but i had been up to  and i am pretty sure i was close that number i got on the scales for the first time in months and was close  i haven’t been able to get below  for years i mean years usually i don’t share just because i am embarrassed or not really impressed with the product i have to share knowing that this may help someone like me… who had literally given up on ever losing any amount of weight again listen to her video about how it works and see if it sounds like the solutions may work for you… if you have trouble with sweets i rarely do my problem was chips… i prayed and asked god to help me with my cravings because i wanted to be good to my body and i found myself being able to put them on my husbands plate without eating any and even being able to let them go stale and throwing them out well i guess that is about it… by now you either think i am a nut or wonder if i am being paid i’m neither just a happy older woman who is thankful to have found something that is helping me to get into some nicer clothes and feel like going out again thank you for your story…can we get an update wondering how things are going now that it has been   day linda thanks for your share looking forward to receiving my product i have inquiriesi’m a female and i currently take nutrilite’s double x before meals i take  or red clover  in addition i take a detox lily of the desertaloe herbal detox formula prior to meals in the morning and noni juice in the evening prior to a meal will there be any conflicts also i’ve been a lifelong narcoleptichypoglycemic… although not a diabetic my physician said i was quotemorbidly obese  ie  pounds overweight with a body index in excess of the norm much can be contributed to injuries incurred from two car accidents which drastically altered my lifestyle from highly active to sedentary now at age  retired yrs’″ and recovered about  i have gained weight and have been a steady lbs over the past decade getting back into an exercise regimen is not easy despite being a former athlete judo instructor rc lifeguard dancer lastly i need to know about excess skin when weight loss incurs will there be shrinkage naturally where are all the promised follow ups exactly right i’m looking for some one with a real testimony as far as bio x working or not i’m not interested in anyone’s personal infestations i love this product it significantly reduced my cravings for food and i am absolutely taking in less foodcalories i’ve dramatically cut my sugar intake stopped the sugary yogurt that i used to eat every morning just a rare cookie or piece of birthday cake now and then i seriously feel like a new person lost almost  pounds i’m also walking every day now because i feel like doing it not because i think i ‘should’ go walking i’m about to order more i started with a  month supply and it’s only been  weeks but i’ve given so much away to friends so they can try for themselves everyone’s remarks do not really give a big endorsement of this product regarding weight loss which is the thing that the long video touted the long video re this product and others i’ve viewed drives me crazy why do they have to go on and on am interested in this product but skeptical until i see a bunch of responses from those who have used this product for  months and give a positive review i’m with you mary just ordered this product mostly for the digestive health as i have had some problems with dairy in the last year and i’m wondering if this will allow me to eat foods without having to be dairy free all the other benefits seem to be a bonus fingers crossed me i ordered it today cant wait until it gets here i hope to keep you all updated just got my  bottles a couple days ago  already noticed more regularity  days in a row which is huge for me since i don’t “go” everyday will try to update later i have ordered a monthly bottle of biox i have a few reservations one is that i take  mgs of celexa per day antidepressant so will talk to my doctor before starting biox i now take an excellent probiotic product made by schiff called “digestive advantage” and am very happy with it as it has brought about regularity consisting of from  to  bms daily this result assures me that it is having positive effects on my digestive system in that it is cleaning out lots of the bad bacteria i’ve never had bms more than x per day and sometimes went for  days inbetween – very irregular because of craving blocking i am really hoping that this product will work for me and i will definitely return to report progress i also take celexa and am worried about interaction did your doctor say you could take it or not hi everyone i was excited to see this page and hope that i can track my progress as well i was hooked when i watched the presentation i am not normally one to go in for something like this but the marketing was very scientific and i am drawn to that even though i didn’t research at all i am very irregular i am sensitive to gluten and dairy although never willing to truly give them up i have had the lap band surgery in  and not a success but took off thirty pounds and kept it off so not a totally waste i am very interested to see how i do on this product whis me luck its day one can i get the biox in canada is a there sissified i am direct take a lot of malediction i had a stoke before now my water is hard to maine feal weak complicate most of the time a large stumic wetting my bed some times i have husserl to the bath room b fore i go an harder carl i have noticed very smelly gas and irregularities in my bm’s over the period of a week i have started taking this product i have not lost any weight but have noticed my stomach feeling flatter i wonder if this is normal i have always noticed that when i start taking a probiotic i always thought it was all that harmful bacteria finally leaving my digestive system i’ve got no problems with that i’m more focus on the digestive system since i suffer from ulcerative colitis anyone under this situation see any improvement or rcend this product please write your comment hello i promised to come back in  days and let you know how it has gone i have not lost weight but my clothes are looser my stomach bloat is gone and i feel a ton better and more comfortable i do have energy a little to much as i have a difficult time going to sleep at night the only real complain i have is that i used to be very regular and now i am super gassy and irregular i am  of the way through my second bottle i will report again in a month this product really does work my start weight was  i started on  today  im down to  hard to believe i know my waist is shrinking as well as my stomach ive tried alot of different things and this is the best by far kim along with this product what diet are you on or what are you doing besides i’ve been on weight watchers which had worked for me in the past but the scale isn’t moving… very frustrating how’s it going with the product any weight loss much too expensive i’m diagnosed with colitis as well so i would be interested in knowing the answer to your question before i purchase i have taken biox for  days now x a day the first few days i had bowel movement  times a day it was great my digestive system is improving after a few days later it has lessened i get more hungry from it rather than my appetite is being suppressed i craved sweets too i’m thinking it was probably because i was pmsing that time i noticed my weight has not decreased nor did it increased so i’m not sure if i noticed anything different anymore i feel great though but i don’t have that energy it says we will have if we’re to take it i don’t know if i should continue it or not because my body is diff from others i found out that the only way to suppress the appetite is to really drink the whole  cups of water  minute before eating then i really feel full before i even start eating and cannot eat as much if i don’t drink enough water or if i drink it after i start eating it doesn’t help… about the energy i really felt it in the first week or  but now i think by body got used to it so i don’t feel any more energetic than the usual however i do feel good overall emailonline hi i’d suggest that you research further about my comments i understand you are smart enough to decide for yourself maybe you need to choose wearing out your kidney’s for now since this filling youraelf w water is a means to an end for now um if we drink more than  oz of liquid before eating then we are diluting the digestive juices which is needed for digestion the older we become we already have less enzymes beceause we produce less enzymes so ergo” the importance of the  enzymes which are in this product for digestion back to the water consumption our kidney’s are only designed to at one time to process oz of liquid max a well read dietician expert tells me if someone has gone without water for far too long then catching up all at once is a waste your kidney’s will overwork and you will water down electrolytes fyi  off topic catching up on dehydration oz wait  minutes then  oz ect dr wylie md a well reknowned hololistic optometrist in spokane wa agrees to not overload the body w water “wearing out your kidneys” is not a thing dehydration causes kidney problems and your stomach continues to produce “digestive juices” all the time not sure about your references…  basic biology class would show you that water is included in every process in the body and is  of your bodies weight science please dont spread the bunk info some people might believe it agree…asians don’t drink water before or after meal at least  min window no wonder they are skinner and have less digestive system problem how do i place my order is there anyone here who has actually lost weight  or is this pill just helps u feel less bloated i lost  pounds in the first  weeks but i believe it was mostly water retention anytime a person starts a new diet and drinks more water they lose water retention weight after that it kind of stabilised they send you an email to know what to expect every few weeks and they say weight loss is around weeks  i’m starting week  now i’ll update if i see any major weight loss… i started taking about  weeks ago but i have to be honest because i don’t eat half as much as i used to before taking the bio x i have been eating everything i should not be eating everything from pizza burgerspasta sweets etc i have not put on one pound but i have not lost one pound either i feel pretty good i don’t feel bloated swollen or inflamed i can truly tell the difference between bio x and all the other crap i have taken i have tried everything under the sun so today saturday  i have started a eat better regime i put nothing but healthy food into my system and do some light workouts nothing crazy i currently weight  and my goal is  i will be back on  to share any results i have achieved so far any the true amount of effort i really gave great recipe  can ea black beans  corn drained fresh chopped sweet peppers half onion or whole chives tomato celery cilantro to taste lime  or lemon juice avocado works as well i only add the avo  cilantro to bowl when dishing it up it will keep  days in fridge if you do lots of other options radishes ect fresh cabbage sprouts best with fresh lime juice add quiona i started this  weekends ago i took as directed and started eating less at meal time and my cravings were reduced my stomach also felt great and not bloated the only thing is that exactly after  week i started getting really bloated all the time it’s been  days straight now that i feel like i have a water balloon for a belly and waiting to see if it’ll get better after more research i discovered that it’s the probiotics that could cause the bloating it depends on the person and people with weaker immune system are more affected also there are different strains of probiotics so if you’re uncomfortable with one it does not mean that you will have the same reaction to all probiotics the body could get used to it eventually or if not the best option would to discontinue the product i will continue using it for a while and see if the discomfort continues or not update all bloating is now gone and i’m back to feeling greatlike i did in the first week i don’t expect any immediate weight loss with the current decrease in appetite however i will definitely be losing a few pounds same here felt great at first then bloated gassy etc i’m going to try to take in more fluids especially water see if that makes a difference been taking them for about  weeks now i take a low dose of thyroid will this pill effect this thyroid medication or my thyroid in general why hasn’t anyone replied with their findings hopefully not dead i kid i’m thinking it didn’t work so they just never came back idk i really wish people did come back positive or negative just tell me what’s going on a couplefew months in… i have been on biox for  days now i take  capsule with breakfast and  with lunch i am on antidepressants so i am not taking  a day it gives me stomach pains if i take  a day so far in the  days i have lost lbs bm’s are not as regular as most have stated i am having about  a day so it’s not too bad i have also increased my water consumption to  oz water bottles compared to barely one a day nothing else in my diet has been changed i have been taking this product for  days and so far i have experienced a much better digestive system which for me is fantastic prior to this i did not have regular bowel movements so the fact that i can go once or twice in one day is life changing for this reason alone i will continue to use this product i can’t speak on the weight loss effects yet as its too early to tell as far as cravings i don’t know if it’s made that much of a difference all in all i would recommend this product especially people with irregular bowels i started my first month  days ago and so far well underwhelming i have actually gained a pound but to be fair i have also eaten things that would have tipped the scale either way maybe more so i am doing the three tablets a day route and started on a weekend to see how my body would adapt everything seems fine and at first i was a little concerned about the bm’s but i am only having them every other day not one per meal as some are having but i think everyone will have a different experience with them depending on your meals the only thing i have noticed about bm’s is that when you have them you better bring a can of air freshener i am keeping a log of what i eat when i eat and my daily weight for each day so i will come back on the weekends while i am still taking biox and let you know how things are going very interesting and a little troubling that not one of the people who promised to come back in  days to report their results has come back to report anything i have been on this product for  days now i take  with lunch and  with dinner i don’t eat breakfast hardly i have notice a big change in my appetite i don’t eat as much and get full faster i am still getting bloated after i eat but it is not nearly as bad i have  movements after each meal and before i would go days without one right now i feel like i am sort of detoxing getting rid of all that crap in my gut other than that it is too early to tell i will keep you posted why are you taking  capsules at a time instead of  at lunch and  with dinner you are only suppose to take  capsules a day not  the bottle states that you can take up to  tablets a day two with each meal but suggests  with each meal she’s still being safe calm down they bottle says that you can take  with each meal and not to exceed  capsules per day take it correctly like stated  with each meal  times daily i just started mine today super excited to see how it works and will update after  days just ordered and cant wait to get i hope this helps i will remember this site and post results i promise i used this product faithfully for  months  times a day with meals i’ve never used anything like this before and was a bit wary still am about what i put in my body but it felt as if my digestion needed some help the positive things that happened for me were that my stomach got flatter my whole lower abdomen felt lighter gas and bloating were just about gone all my cravings stopped i needed less food to feel full and i actually lost a few pounds just to be sure about the results when the pills ran out i deliberately went for a week to see what would happen well all my old symptoms came back–so i decided to order more however when i went on the website i could not figure out how to access the lower price i had paid previously which i thought was guaranteed for life i also could not figure out to access the  discount touted on a current ad i have sent a complaint to their customer service and am awaiting a reply will keep you posted please let us know thank you hey have you ever gotten a response what did they say i watched the video and it stated that it was a one time discount… try amazon how do i order on line is it sold locally yuba city ca i’m a teacher and can’t run to the bathroom any time i need to how long after taking the supplement does a bm occur it’s unfortunate that this may be what keeps me from trying it… i have not been taking this very long but i have not had any issues with having to run to the bathroom after taking biox and my husband hasn’t either so i wouldn’t let that worry stop you from trying this… does anyone have any results after day use did anyone get a full refund with no hassle my father and i both bought a  day supply he notices he’s not as hungry and only eats about half of the food he normally ate so far he is impressed i started these  days ago my craving have gone down a lot previous binge eater and i have  bowel movements post meal they only thing if i dug it up was just that my stomach kinda hurts after any food but feel better after bm so far i don’t know about the numbers on the scale but i was developing tightening of the skin from rapid weight gain prior to these pills and now my skin doesn’t feel like it’s tearing anymore i just ordered a  bottle supply it will be cool to see because my girlfriend will be trying them also we have already started a diet of avoiding fastfood most high fructose corn syrup products and sugary bevarges intend to start as directed and hoping it will go well i’ll let you know when i reicieve my product is there anyone who tried this procduct in  and have results i do have a friend at work that is taking this and a digestive enzymes to lose weight she has lost  pounds so far i am starting mine soonside effects of bio x according to nucific bio x has no known side effects and it is made up of pure ingredients they manufacture supplements that are both glutenfree and allergenfree and their products do not contain any filler ingredients whatsoever the only warning bio x gives is that people taking antidepressants should be wary about using bio x because it contains caralluma fimbriata extract which may cause mood swings if you are taking common antidepressants if you are on an antidepressant then it’s recommended you ask your doctor whether or not bio x is right for you i just started today…i will definitely keep you guys posted i am just as curious as everyone else wish me luck this is my  day and i see better improvement with regularly definitely a plus for me i’ve noticed that my stomach has went down some only been
