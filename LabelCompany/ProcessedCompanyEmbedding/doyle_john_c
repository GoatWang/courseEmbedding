facebook john c doyle jr smallwood was always on the lookout for entrepreneurs and advisors who could help bring about his dream of economic diversification and prosperity perhaps the most colourful was john c doyle born in chicago in  doyle went to western canada as a coal salesman moving east in  he purchased canadian javelin foundries and machine works a joliette québec stovemaking operation the business was reorganized in  as canadian javelin limited which doyle used as a holding company for his subsequent ventures industrial development opportunity iron ore around wabush lake doyle first became interested in newfoundland’s resources in  on his way to the province to collect a large coal debt he met the provincial geologist the latter told doyle that a strip of ironore rich land around wabush lake in labrador was about to revert to the government – or more accurately to the newfoundland and labrador corporation nalco a development company created by the provincial government and alfred valdmanis in  the area originally belonged to the labrador mining and exploration company which shed it under an agreement that stipulated that  percent of the company’s concessions had to be relinquished every year in july  nalco granted concessions to doyle and javelin which included the rights to a large area of western labrador containing ironore rich deposits from this point on the story is confused but it appears that in september  doyle and javelin acquired a controlling interest in nalco with six seats on the board valdmanis did his best to block javelin taking over nalco completely but failed – even though doyle was in financial difficulties and javelin shares had been delisted from the montreal stock exchange in the end smallwood sided with doyle against valdmanis and in march  the former received  square miles of prime nalco holdings in central labrador nalco was reorganized in such a way that most directors were to be provincial government nominees doyle spent approximately  million surveying and drilling the area around lake wabush he also commissioned american engineering expertise to improve the ore benefaction process and brought about the consortium of international mining interests known as wabush mines before the opening of the mines the sunday times supplement optimistically gushed “after javelin neither newfoundland nor the international steel industry will be quite the same again” ore  in the mid s doyle also built a railway connecting wabush to the québec north shore and the labrador railway but not without the newfoundland government guaranteeing a  million bond issue enabling him to do so the bond was never called in but it was an issue that raised some strenuous objections in the house of assembly smallwood was clearly impressed by doyle’s ability to promote industrial development and overlooked his shady financial manoeuvres – indeed the government continued to put money into javelin projects and memorial university awarded him an honorary doctorate in  – linked no doubt to his donation of  for a student residence newfoundland and labradors greatest white collar criminal doyle faced income tax investigations in the early s and canadian javelin continued to be delisted from the stock exchanges for securities violations throughout the mid s and into the s in  the united states securities and exchange commission sec became involved because canadian javelin stocks were trading vigorously in the united states the stocks were not registered in the united states and in order to do so the vendor doyle needed to provide detailed financial information about the company doyle was never forthcoming with financial information about his companies in  he was arraigned in montréal on charges of theft conspiracy and fraud involving  in mining stock though the charges ware ultimately dismissed by  the sec caught up with him again and the lead investigator laid eleven charges against doyle involving fraud and stock manipulation as well as a technical violation resulting from sending unregistered stock through the mail to an investor he was fined  for this offence and sentenced to serve a reduced term of three months doyle jumped bail and skipped the country on july   he later claimed that he plead guilty in an effort to get the ordeal over with a move he would never have made if he had suspected jail time was imminent by the end of the s canadian tax collectors also began to hound doyle for claims going back two decades he managed to have the amounts reduced through appeals from  million in back taxes to  million doyle had a sketchy financial past long before he came to newfoundland but his disastrous foray into the paper business is what he is mainly remembered for smallwood always had aspirations for a third pulp and paper mill in the province and some of the literature claims doyle did too however in an interview in the evening telegram in  doyle claimed he never wanted anything to do with the paper business “we only got into it the linerboard project because smallwood insisted he couldn’t find anyone else…we wanted to develop our ore body we made no bones about the fact that we weren’t paper people” the evening telegram april   eventually smallwood and doyle did agree on a joint venture for a linerboard mill in stephenville utilizing wood from labrador in  a subsidiary of javelin the melville pulp and paper company began cutting pulpwood in goose bay for the stephenville mill the linerboard mill proved to be a disastrous project the estimated cost of the entire project including the woodcutting facilities in labrador the transportation costs involved and the linerboard mill was approximately  million the federal government committed  million toward harbour improvements waterworks and incentive grants for the project other capital was guaranteed through some british banks the british government and an american financial house doyle’s initial investment was only  million borrowed from a pension fund controlled by jimmy hoffa’s teamsters union he eventually came up with  million working capital of his own but only after the canadian government expressed concern about doyle’s meagre financial commitment the provincial government initially committed  million to the project but made a fatal error in judgement by including an “openended” clause in the  melville pulp and paper ltd authorization of agreement act or bill  this allowed the government to exceed initial funding projections and provide whatever monies were necessary for the completion of the project in  the government guaranteed an additional  as associated costs continued to rise the provincial government continued to rescue the project in november  when a consulting firm warned of the suspension of construction due to lack of finances the newfoundland government infused  million on june   and another  million four months later by  the linerboard venture had cost the newfoundland government approximately  million and the mill had not yet opened its doors frank moores’ progressive conservative government moved in purchased the mill from doyle and turned the business into a crown corporation the scandal caused by john doyle and the stephenville linerboard mill may have been the biggest whitecollar crime in newfoundland and labrador’s history doyle manipulated javelin stocks so that the bulk of the profit would go to the melville pulp and paper company and canadian javelin but not to the newfoundland government the majority javelin shareholder the “privileged” stocks he created for the government paid no dividends and were redeemable at  cents each totalling  – independent of how much javelin common stock became worth this ultimately gave doyle power over the company stockholders seeking to get rid of him while providing no financial benefit for the government it was reported that doyle paid his lawyers  million yearly to keep him out of trouble nevertheless he was charged in the newfoundland supreme court in  by the rcmp with  counts of fraud and breach of trust stemming from the linerboard scheme and he was brought forcibly to st johns the mill had been built on the former site of the united states air force base which included two buildings valued by the provincial government at  million it was alleged that doyle purchased them for a mere  through oliver vardy the deputy minister of economic development who was rumoured to be heavily involved in doyle’s schemes doyle was also investigated for a suspicious land purchase product for the linerboard mill was to be harvested within two blocks of land totalling  square miles in labrador around  square miles belonged to nalco then a canadian javelin subsidiary and the other  square miles had been purchased by doyle for  million from a “…curious company called société transshipping owned in liechtenstein…” macleans  doyle had been previously accused of funnelling  million dollars worth of canadian javelin stock to liechtenstein it was thrown out of court but suspicions were aroused and the rcmp became interested in the authenticity of doyle’s purchase of timber rights according to the province’s then conservative finance minister john crosbie société transshipping had received the timber rights free of charge based on a march  letter from then liberal premier joseph smallwood the whole deal was more than a little dubious by the mids doyle’s name was also linked to the “l’affaire des six” bribery scandal in québec no evidence was ever found meanwhile smallwood was enamoured with doyle even after his  arrest time magazine quipped “joey smallwood once boasted that he wished the province had  john c doyles if so newfoundland would have been hard put for courtrooms to accommodate them” time  a master manipulator how was doyle able to get away with so much for so long smallwood’s obsession with job creation was one of the biggest reasons which essentially made newfoundland an easy target to exploit crosbie nicknamed doyle an “evil genius” a “seductive slug” and characterized the relationship between the american and premier smallwood as “one of the most tawdry stories in twentiethcentury politics” globe and mail  but besides smallwoods complicity doyle himself was a master manipulator when two fbi agents came to question him concerning violations of american securities laws doyle turned on his “easy charm” and sold them stock in canadian javelin doyle left a legacy of convoluted government loans and international transactions tainting the newfoundland government and the stephenville linerboard mill that have never been entirely unravelled his history with the law is one of skilful escapes and evasions doyle became active in south america through canadian javelin and made news headlines well into the eighties the federal corporations branch of the ministry of corporate and consumer affairs filed a claim to nullify his  holding in javelin in  but he continued to draw a salary from javelin up to  doyle died in his panama home a fugitive from justice at the age of

in  in english and held by  worldcat member library worldwide contrasting views of complexity and their implications for networkcentric infrastructures book  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member library worldwide there exists a widely recognized need to better understand and manage complex systems of systems ranging from biology ecology and medicine to networkcentric technologies this is motivating the search for universal laws of highly evolved systems and driving demand for new mathematics and methods that are consistent integrative and predictive however the theoretical frameworks available today are not merely fragmented but sometimes contradictory and incompatible we argue that complexity arises in highly evolved biological and technological systems primarily to provide mechanisms to create robustness however this complexity itself can be a source of new fragility leading to robust yet fragile tradeoffs in system design we focus on the role of robustness and architecture in networked infrastructures and we highlight recent advances in the theory of distributed control driven by network technologies this view of complexity in highly organized technological and biological systems is fundamentally different from the dominant perspective in the mainstream sciences which downplays function constraints and tradeoffs and tends to minimize the role of organization and design finite time horizon robust performance by jorge e tierno  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member library worldwide canadian javelin

stabilization of linear systems with structured perturbations  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide the problem of stabilization of linear systems with bounded structured uncertainties are considered in this paper two notions of stability denoted quadratic stability qstability and stability are considered and corresponding notions of stabilizability and detectability are defined in both cases the output feedback stabilization problem is reduced via a separation argument to two simpler problems full information i and full control fc the set of all stabilizing controllers can be parametrized as a linear fractional transformation lft on a free stable parameter for qstability stabilizability and detectability can in turn be characterized by linear matrix inequalities lmis and the fi and fc qstabilization problems can be solved using the corresponding lmis in the standard onedimensional case the results in this paper reduce to wellknown results on controller parametrization using statespace methods although the development here relies more heavily on elegant lft machinery and avoids the need for coprime factorizations robust control of uncertain nonlinear systems  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide several new results were obtained extending standard analysis techniques to linear fractional transformations lft using structured singular value micron and linear matrix inequalities lmi in solving lft problems lfts and lmis play a very important role in postmodern control theory by providing a framework that unifies many concepts and generalizes transfer functions and their statespace realizations to include uncertainty doyle zhou and packard  reviews known results on robust

fundamental tools for automating the system design system identification controller synthesis and various aspects of analysis and simulation mathematics and the internet a source of enormous confusion and great potential  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide for many mathematicians and physicists the internet has become a popular realworld domain for the application andor development of new theories related to the organization and behavior of largescale complex and dynamic systems in some cases the internet has served both as inspiration and justification for the popularization of new models and mathematics within the scientific enterprise for example scalefree network models of the preferential attachment type  have been claimed to describe the internets connectivity structure resulting in surprisingly general and strong claims about the networks resilience to random failures of its components and its vulnerability to targeted attacks against its infrastructure  these models have as their trademark powerlaw type node degree distributions that drastically distinguish them from the classical erdosrenyi type random graph models  these scalefree network models have attracted significant attention within the scientific community and have been partly responsible for launching and fueling the new field of network science   can complexity science support the engineering of critical network infrastructures  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide considerable attention is now being devoted to the study of complexity science with the intent of discovering and applying universal laws of highly interconnected and evolved systems this paper considers several issues related to the use of these theories in the context of critical infrastructures particularly the internet specifically we revisit the notion of organized complexity and suggest that it is fundamental to our ability to understand operate and design nextgeneration infrastructure networks we comment on the role of engineering in defining an architecture to support networked infrastructures and highlight
