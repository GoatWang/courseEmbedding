that making the company – then known as the owens bottle company – among the first to offer containers of a consistent shape and size owens bottle company merged with illinois glass company in  and the resulting company was named owensillinois glass company it wasn’t long before the company began manufacturing plastics – owensillinois made its first plastic closure in  – and in  company leaders decided to change its name to the more inclusive owensillinois inc the company’s name changed again in  when owensillinois changed its trade name to oi to consolidate its operations under one brand name that would work in any language the company is still legally known as owensillinois however for decades owensillinois’ plastics division manufactured containers closures trigger sprayers prescription containers and other plastic products but in  the company sold that division and today it focuses exclusively on glass a fortune  company owensillinois had revenues of  billion in  products manufactured by owensillinois that contained asbestos for a short time in the s and s owensillinois manufactured a line of hightemperature calciumsilicate pipe and boiler insulation under the product name “kaylo” the company manufactured kaylo at least from  to  at which point owensillinois sold its kaylo division to owenscorning an ohiobased fiberglass company in fact owenscorning got its start in the s when researchers at owensillinois decided to experiment with glass fiber products like many insulation products at the time kaylo contained asbestos a naturally occurring mineral that can be broken down into long stringy fibers in the late s the united states’ growing industrial sector realized those fibers could be very useful – they were strong durable versatile they were excellent insulators and helped prevent the spread of fire before long asbestos was being mined around the world and shipped in massive quantities to us soil where it was added to everything from cigarette filters to car brakes to spackle of course asbestos didn’t magically get into these products by itself millions of workers handled the substance daily on assembly lines laboratories and construction sites never realizing that by doing so they were irreparably damaging their health now we know that exposure to asbestos causes respiratory diseases like asbestosis a chronic inflammation of the lungs and mesothelioma a formerly rare type of cancer caused only by asbestos exposure diseases like these are caused when asbestos particles become released into the air and are inhaled into a person’s lungs this happens most often during the manufacturing process when raw asbestos fibers can easily become airborne or when asbestos products age and deteriorate releasing dust into the environment products manufactured by owensillinois that contained asbestos include but are not limited to kaylo insulation manufactured by owensillinois from  later manufactured by owenscorning until  occupations at risk of asbestos exposure anyone who worked with or near kaylo insulation products between  and  may be at risk of being diagnosed with mesothelioma or another asbestosrelated disease those most likely to be affected are insulation contractors construction workers boilermakers roofers plumbers or others who came into contact with asbestoscontaining insulation on a job site – especially during the oftendusty installation or demolition processes factory workers who manufactured kaylo products in owensillinois or owenscorning factories were also at a high risk of exposure but the reach of these products goes farther still churches factories apartment buildings – any building that utilized kaylo insulation on their pipes or in their boiler rooms could have posed a risk to the people inside and unfortunately there is evidence that asbestos exposure risk can travel that is workers who brought home asbestos dust at the end of the day on their clothing shoes or hair could have put their loved ones at risk by secondhand contact recent news as of may  owensillinois has been named in thousands of lawsuits by plaintiffs who say their health suffered after they were exposed to asbestos in the company’s products as of december   the company reported that it had  asbestos claims pending and had resolved approximately  claims the previous year alone share tweet

a result they are now at risk to develop mesothelioma in this section learn about the history of asbestos use about the products that contained asbestos and about the companies that manufactured them find out which occupations and trades are at higher risk for asbestos exposure learn which job sites across the united states were contaminated with asbestos containing materials and about the risks associated with handling asbestos what is asbestos long considered a miracle material asbestos boasts excellent fire and heat resistant properties this naturallyoccurring mineral now known to be a human carcinogen cancercausing agent has a history that dates back to ancient greece asbestos was used as a building material even as far back as during the roman empire asbestos was a component of fabric that would be used in clothing and a variety of other textiles during the industrial revolution asbestos use grew in factories and other heavy industries throughout the united states asbestos was used not only in factories but also in oil refineries chemical plants on railroad cars and in shipyards asbestos materials were used to insulate pipes and boilers in steam locomotives to line tanks and ovens in refineries and could be found literally everywhere aboard the nation’s ships from engine rooms to galleys as the twentieth century progressed more uses for asbestos were found it was used in the brakes and clutches of automobiles insulated america’s new skyscrapers and was used extensively in the construction industry where it was used in asbestos products like joint compounds cements roofing shingles ceiling and floor tiles siding stucco plaster and much more those workers at risk included any that worked in an asbestosheavy industry or frequently handled asbestos products by the middle of the twentieth century it became apparent that asbestos was causing health problems asbestos exposure is now known to cause mesothelioma this asbestosrelated cancer can occur when asbestos is inhaled and the microscopic fibers become lodged within the outer lung tissue layer known as the mesothelium this thin layer of cells protects and lubricates the chest cavity asbestos causes a sustained inflammation of these cells resulting in harmful scar tissue forming on the surface this scar tissue lays the foundation for cancerous cells to develop despite knowledge of the health risks posed by asbestos historical records indicate that many companies who used asbestos in their facilities knew that the material was dangerous yet continued to allow its use over time as stories of sick employees became commonplace the american government began to consider imposing laws about regulating the use of asbestos asbestos exposure in the united states exposure usually occurred at major construction jobsites in shipyards aboard navy vessels and during construction or renovation of commercial buildings people working in the vicinity of boilers and insulated piping often are at risk in addition teachers students and other staff members who work in older school buildings may be at risk of exposure to asbestos products such as ceiling or floor tiles equally at risk are families of these workers as asbestos often was carried home on clothing asbestos exposure across the united states alabama alaska arizona arkansas california colorado connecticut delaware

south dakota tennessee texas utah vermont virginia washington washington dc west virginia wisconsin wyoming if you worked at a jobsite where asbestos or asbestos containing products were used you may be at risk to develop mesothelioma different types of asbestos exposure military exposure asbestos was used across all branches of the military for many years navy veterans were exposed to high levels of asbestos while serving on ships aircraft carriers destroyers submarines battleships warships etc in the naval fleet as well as in naval shipyards across the country army veterans were exposed to asbestos in buildings on military installations and while working on military vehicles air force veterans were exposed while working with military aircraft marine corps veterans that spent time at sea aboard navy ships were exposed to asbestos all veterans exposed to asbestos have an increased risk of developing mesothelioma commercial and industrial exposure many workers and maintenance contractors at industrial and commercial job sites were subjected to dangerous levels of asbestos on the job asbestos is a known carcinogen and the primary cause of mesothelioma cancer the types of jobsites where asbestos exposure occurred include oil refineries power plants steel mills and chemical plants to name a few they all have “high heat” environments where the use of fire and heat resistant materials was required be it in the construction of the plants or machinery or in the protective clothing that workers were required to wear in designated areas ie fireproof gloves and aprons today even though the use of asbestos has been banned in the united states many existing industrial and commercial structures may still contain a certain level of asbestos it is important that appropriate safety precautions be taken where necessary to prevent harmful exposure and to mitigate the risk of developing mesothelioma commercial product exposure doityourself home renovation enthusiasts as well as those who worked in the construction trade may have been exposed to asbestos while working with popular building and construction products many of these products were made with asbestos through the late ’s as the projects they were to be used in required that they be heat and fire resistant they included insulation roofing material siding joint compound ceiling tiles flooring and more unfortunately when any of these products were cut sawed filed or sanded asbestos fibers were released into the air in the majority of cases those working with the products did not use appropriate safety precautions because asbestos companies withheld information about the health hazards of asbestos for many years today as a result construction workers and doityourselfers are at risk for developing mesothelioma or other asbestosrelated diseases second hand exposure direct onthejob asbestos exposure did not affect american workers alone their family members were also at risk of developing an asbestosrelated disease as a result of second hand asbestos exposure this type of exposure occurred when workers brought asbestos fibers home on their hair clothing or shoes at the end of the work day those responsible for laundering their work clothes day in and day out were most commonly affected but even small children who spent time with their parent before they had a chance to “clean up” from work were unknowingly placed at risk of developing an asbestosrelated illness talc exposure talc is a naturally occurring silicate mineral most commonly used in cosmetics and toiletries talc mineral on its own is believed to be safe but talc deposits are often found near and among asbestos deposits due to this some talc deposits are contaminated with asbestos fibers causing talc miners to be unknowingly exposed to asbestos while talc miners are at the greatest risk of asbestos exposure some consumer products namely baby powder and more recently children’s art supplies have been found to contain asbestos and cause regular users mostly women to be exposed to asbestos today products using talc are tested for asbestos but that was not always the case because mesothelioma has a long latency period miners and consumers are being diagnosed with mesothelioma decades later from their job and use of the asbestoscontaining talc products unions protect workers from asbestos exposure throughout the united states and across the world hundreds of labor and trade unions are in place to protect individuals who work in myriad industries from steel workers to plumbers to electricians unions have for a long time played a significant role in protecting workers right when it comes to asbestos exposure on the job unions have organized witnesses for court cases have stepped forward to financially aid widows and children of those diagnosed with mesothelioma and have fought against inadequate trust funds proposed by megacompanies to compensate asbestos victims compensation for workers exposed to asbestos if you have developed health problems associated with asbestos exposure you may be entitled to compensation each state has its own deadlines called statutes of limitations which allow victims of asbestos exposure to file lawsuits dont wait until it is too late to protect your rights request a free evaluation now if you or someone you love has

to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump
