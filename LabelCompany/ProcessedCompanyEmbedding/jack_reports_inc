rainfall in california jack in the box® system samestore sales improved to positive territory as these transitory issues passed and we pivoted our advertising towards value messages however samestore sales at qdoba® company restaurants worsened in the latter two months of the quarter as we lapped more aggressive discounting in last years second quarter while margins at qdoba were still disappointing they improved to over  percent in the final month of the quarter as we were able to manage labor and food costs more effectively than in the first quarter despite the larger decline in samestore sales we are also encouraged that qdoba company samestore sales have improved thus far in the third quarter “at our investor meeting last may we said one of the factors that would cause us to reconsider our strategy with respect to qdoba was valuation it has become more apparent since then that the overall valuation of the company is being impacted by having two different business models as a result weve retained morgan stanley  co llc to assist the board in its evaluation of potential alternatives with respect to qdoba as well as other ways to enhance shareholder value “lastly
