recorder vedr designed to provide liability protection as well as insurance and operational savings through proof in vehicular accidents and against fraudulent claims inspiring safe and professional behavior incident review for training purposes monitoring blind spots or separate vehicle compartments etc digital ally is a leading provider of fleet video systems which are used by thousands of companies and governmental departments and agencies in all  states and around the world in addition to the initial insurance and long term savings usually associated with installing vedrs digital allys video event data recorders provide additional savings opportunities by providing software at no cost and not requiring ongoing contracts or additional equipment digital ally’s dvm and dvmplus model vedrs record and store video audio and detailed information from vehicle involved incidents recordings may be set to automatically start by reaching specific speeds driving within specified gps corridors or ranges and numerous other customizable options including violent maneuvers shifting the vehicle into reverse emergency lights door sensors etc recordings may also be started manually such as to record criminal actions of passengers or events transpiring outside a stopped vehicle to capture the actions that led up to an incident as well as to allow for manual recording delay from human reaction time  seconds prior to the moment a recording is triggered is also captured which is referred to as “preevent recording” for instance an abrupt change in accelerationdeceleration such as during a vehicular accident or sudden stop can be set to automatically trigger a recording however if another person caused the incident such as illegally turning in front of the vedrequipped vehicle it will also be recorded providing valuable protection to the driver and their employer digital ally’s vedrs are integrated into a rearview mirror so that they do not interfere with the driver’s line of site or take up valuable space their design allows for easy installation into any type of vehicle including those that did not previously include a rearview mirror integrated cameras and a microphone inside the rearview mirror capture video in front of the vehicle as well as video and audio inside the vehicle an optional third camera and monitor hidden behind the mirror glass are often used when backing the vehicle up or monitoring a vehicle compartment the specialized oneway mirror glass allows this optional monitor to remain invisible while not in use digital ally’s vedrs record in d x high resolution video with customizable frame rates and record times the systems utilize solid state memory the most durable vibrationproof and reliable medium for mobile video documentation recordings are saved onto gb of internal solid state memory with optional redundancy onto gbgb removable sd memory cards when using sd memory cards the internal memory will loop automatically overwriting the oldest recordings recordings may be downloaded from the sd memory cards through usb or with optional wireless download attempts to tamper with recordings can be detected with authenticity verification and additional security is available through disabling the usb port when using wireless download and locking the sd card access door the systems come with the gps receiverantenna microphone and cameras etc as well as back office software for more information contact digital ally at  email protected or visit wwwdigitalallyinccom  tags digital ally video event

and markets advanced video surveillance products for law enforcement homeland security and commercial applications today announced its operating results for the first quarter of  an investor conference call is scheduled for  am edt on may   see details belowhighlights for quarter ended march   total revenue increased  to approximately  million in the first quarter  compared with approximately  million in the quarter ended march   this increase was primarily due to the large commercial order received in the first quarter  from american medical response amr for dvm event recorders with fleetvu and asset tracking service the amr contract was for  dvm systems as well as fleetvu manager cloud storage and system implementation most of which were delivered in first quarter  and had a positive impact on revenues recurring service revenues will start in second quarter  on a sequential basis total revenue increased  to approximately  million in the first quarter  compared with approximately  million in the quarter ended december   gross profit margin improved to  of total revenue in the first quarter  compared with  in the yearearlier quarter on a sequential basis gross margin improved to  of total revenue in the first quarter  compared with  in the quarter ended december   during the first quarter of  we shipped more than  units of our mirror based products including shipments to law enforcement and commercial customers this represents our highest number of mirror based units shipped during any quarter since  this demonstrates the traction in our commercial dvm business as well as our dvm and dvm hd products service and other revenues increased  during the three months ended march   compared with the yearearlier quarter we have recently introduced several new cloudbased and other recurring service offerings to our product suite including our revamped vuvaultcom cloud storage service to law enforcement customers and the fleetvu manager our driver management training and asset tracking cloud systems for nonlaw enforcement customers our fleetvu manager users are able to manage and monitor their fleet drivers using their own customized and defined feedback parameters such as speed hard braking geofencing and erratic turns all of which are automatically uploaded to fleetvumanagercom without having to manually sort through hours of recorded video events these recurring revenue services generate more predictable and stable revenue streams for us  we recently released our new dvm hd incar video system which provides the first full hd quality incar video system available on the market the dvm hd is the new standard in high definition p incar video systems for law enforcement and is gaining the attention of our customers and potential customers because of its advanced features at an attractive price point  during  we filed patent infringement lawsuits against two competitors axon enterprise inc formerly taser international inc and enforcement video llc dba as watchguard video we have alleged that these competitors are infringing on our patented autoactivation feature embodied in our vulink product we believe that our patented auto activation feature is becoming an industry standard required in a majority of competitive bids to supply body cameras to law enforcement customers law enforcement agencies across the country have recognized the groundbreaking nature of our autoactivation patents and are demanding this technology we believe that axon and watchguard have grown their market shares on the back of our innovations because they were unable to develop their own solutions we will continue to aggressively pursue our claims that axon and watchguard have willfully infringed our patents further we believe that the outcome of this litigation will generally set the competitive landscape for bodyworn cameras utilized by law enforcement agencies for the foreseeable future the company reported an operating loss of  for the three months ended march   compared with an operating loss of  in the yearearlier quarter on a sequential basis our operating loss improved to  in the first quarter  compared with an operating loss of  in the quarter ended december   a net loss of  or  per share was recorded in the three months ended march   compared with a net loss of  or  per share in the three months ended march   on a nongaap basis the company recorded an adjusted net loss of  or  per share for the three months ended march   compared with a nongaap adjusted net loss of  or  per share in the yearearlier quarter management commentswe are excited to report that first quarter revenues were up  from prioryear levels and  on a sequential basis stated stanton e ross chief executive officer of digital ally inc we shipped more mirrors in first quarter  than any quarter since  and our service revenues were up  in the three months ended march   compared to yearearlier levels our strategy of expanding our recurring servicebased revenue to help stabilize and grow our revenues on a quarterly basis is apparent in our first quarter  resultswe are pursuing several new market channels that do not involve our traditional law enforcement and private security customers and utilize our core technology of mobile audiovideo recording equipment together with our cloud storage and archiving services these new market channels do not effectively utilize the power of audiovideo recordings which could represent very large untapped addressable markets for our products and services if successful we believe that these new market channels could yield increased recurring service revenues for us in  and beyond mr ross continued we are promoting a new revenue model that bundles our product offerings including the longterm lease of our bodyworn andor incar audiovideo hardware together with a monthly subscription for our cloud storage search and archiving services for the underlying audio and video material we believe this revenue service model may appeal to our customers in particular our commercial and other nonlaw enforcement customers because it reduces the capital outlay up front and eliminates repairs and maintenance in exchange for level monthly payments for the utilization of the equipment data storage and management services we recently announced the launch of the dvm hd incar video system which we believe will be disruptive in the market and will lead to an expansion of our overall market share in the law enforcement channel the dvm hd system provides full p high definition video at a costeffective price point which we believe is a competitive market advantage for usour international revenues decreased to  in first quarter  compared to  during  our first quarter  international revenues were disappointing after several positive quarters however the international sales cycle generally takes longer than domestic business and we have a number of bids outstanding to international customerswe had approximately  million in net working capital available at march   including  million of accounts receivable and  million of inventory we raised  million through the issuance of  secured convertible debentures in december  these mature in march  unless converted by their holders at  per share before such date the debentures represent a current liability as of march   our goal is to reduce inventory levels during  to provide additional working capital and improve our operating results to generate the funds to retire the debentures we may also pursue the raise of additional capital if required concluded rossfirst quarter operating resultsfor the three months ended march   our total revenue increased by  to approximately  million compared with revenue of approximately  million for the three months march   this increase was primarily due to the large commercial order received in the first quarter  from amr for dvm event recorders with fleetvu and asset tracking service the amr contract was for  dvm systems as well as fleetvu manager cloud storage and system implementation most of which were delivered in first quarter  and had a positive impact on revenues international revenue decreased to  during first quarter  versus  during first quarter  gross profit increased  to  for the three months ended march   versus  in  read moreour gross margin increase is commensurate with the  increase in revenues for the three months ended march   and the cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreasing to  from  for the three months ended march   we expect that gross margins will continue to improve in  because we believe we have corrected the quality control and other warranty related issues affecting our firstvu hd product during recent quarters our goal is to improve our margins to  over the longer term based on the expected margins of our newer products in particular the dvm dvm hd and firstvu hd as they continue to gain traction in the marketplace and we increase our commercial market penetration in  in addition as revenues from these products increase we will seek to further improve our margins from them through economies of scale and more efficiently utilizing fixed manufacturing overhead components we plan to continue our initiative on more efficient management of our supply chain through outsourcing production quantity purchases and more effective purchasing practicesselling general and administrative sga expenses decreased approximately  to  in the three months ended march   versus  a year earlier we reported an operating loss of  for the three months ended march   compared with an operating loss of  in the previous yearinterest income decreased to  in first quarter  from  in  noncash charges totaled  in first quarter  compared with noncash income of  in the yearearlier quarter such noncash income charges reflect changes in the fair value of the secured convertible debentures and warrant derivatives we elected to record the  million secured convertible debentures issued in december  on their fair value basis and recorded a loss of  due to the change in their fair value as of march   warrants to purchase  common shares remain unexercised at march   and  which are treated as derivative liabilities and we recorded income of  due to the change in their fair value as of march  interest expense totaled  in the three months ended march   compared to  in the three months ended march   we issued an aggregate of  million principal amount of secured convertible debentures on december   which bore interest at the rate of  per annum and remained outstanding at march   no similar interest bearing debt was outstanding during the  period we reported a net loss of  or  per share in the first quarter of  compared with a prioryear net loss of  or  per share no income tax provision or benefit was recorded in the first quarter of either  or  we expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets including net operating loss carry forwards until we determine that we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize such assets during first quarter  we increased our valuation reserve on deferred tax assets by approximately  as of march   we had approximately  million of net operating loss carryforwards and  million of research and development tax credit carryforwards available to offset future net taxable income on a nongaap basis we reported an adjusted net loss before depreciation amortization net interest expense change in derivative liabilities change in the fair value of secured convertible notes secured convertible debentures issuance expense and stockbased compensation of  or  per share for the quarter ended march   versus a nongaap adjusted net loss of  or  per diluted share in the first quarter of  nongaap adjusted net loss is described in greater detail in a table at

ksmarketwired  mar    digital ally inc  nasdaq  dgly  which develops manufactures and markets advanced video surveillance products for law enforcement homeland security and commercial applications today announced its operating results for the quarter and full year ended december   an investor conference call is scheduled for  am edt tomorrow march   see details belowhighlights for year ended december   we expanded our addressable market outside of law enforcement with the award of several large orders involving our incar event recorder and body camera products to nonlaw enforcement customers during  these orders demonstrate the importance of our solution to meet customer demands and our flexibility to adapt our hardware and software to handle unique requirements for a variety of industries and applications we introduced several new cloudbased and other recurring service offerings to our product suite including our revamped vuvaultcom cloud storage service to law enforcement customers and the fleetvu manager our driver management training and asset tracking cloud systems for nonlaw enforcement customers our fleetvu manager users are able to manage and monitor their fleet drivers using their own customized and defined feedback parameters such as speed hard braking geofencing and erratic turns all of which are automatically uploaded to fleetvumanagercom without having to manually sort through hours of recorded video events these recurring revenue services generate more predictable and stable revenue streams for us service and other revenues increased  during  compared with  we recently released our new dvm hd incar video system which provides the first full hd quality incar video system available on the market the dvm hd is the new standard in high definition p incar video systems for law enforcement and is gaining the attention of our customers and potential customers because of its advanced features at an attractive price point  during  we were awarded a contract for the sale of firstvu hd bodyworn cameras to a nonlaw enforcement international customer the threeyear supply contract includes our firstvu hd bodyworn cameras storage systems and an extended service agreement the revenue from the initial orders delivered in  exceeded  with additional service revenues of  expected for  through  our international revenues increased to  representing  of total revenues during the year ended december   compared with  representing  of total revenues during the year ended december   in december  we completed a private placement of  million in principal amount of  secured convertible debentures and warrants exercisable to purchase  shares of common stock at  per share to two institutional investors this private placement resulted in gross proceeds of  million before placement agent fees and other expenses associated with the transaction which totaled  we are using the net proceeds for general working capital purposes and to continue to execute our business plan during  we filed patent infringement lawsuits against two competitors taser international inc and enforcement video llc dba as watchguard video we have alleged that these competitors are infringing on our patented autoactivation feature embodied in our vulink product we believe that our patented auto activation feature is becoming an industry standard required in a majority of competitive bids to supply body cameras to law enforcement customers law enforcement agencies across the country have recognized the groundbreaking nature of our autoactivation patents and are demanding this technology we believe that taser and watchguard have grown their market shares on the back of our innovations because they were unable to develop their own solutions we will continue to aggressively pursue our claims that taser and watchguard have willfully infringed our patents further we believe that the outcome of this litigation will generally set the competitive landscape for bodyworn cameras utilized by law enforcement agencies for the foreseeable future during  we encountered excessive rework costs for our products due to nonrecurring supply chain issues with certain of our contract manufacturers the supply chain issues have been corrected however the effects of these issues impacted our revenues and gross margins for  total revenue decreased by  to approximately  million in  compared with approximately  million in the year ended december   gross profit margin decreased to  of total revenue in  compared with  in  the company reported an operating loss of  for the full year of  compared with an operating loss of  in the previous year operating loss in the fourth quarter of  was  compared with  in the prioryear period a net loss of  or  per share was recorded in the year ended december   compared with a net loss of  or  per share in  on a nongaap basis the company recorded an adjusted net loss of  or  per share in  compared with a nongaap adjusted net loss of  or  per share in the year ended december   management commentswe were disappointed to report revenues for the year ended  that decreased  from the year prior even though we saw an increase in our servicebased revenues in  stated stanton e ross chief executive officer of digital ally inc we are concentrating on expanding our recurring servicebased revenue to help stabilize and grow our revenues on a quarterly basis we are pursuing several new market channels that do not involve our traditional law enforcement and private security customers if successful we believe that these new market channels could yield increased recurring service revenues for us in  and beyond we are testing a new revenue model that bundles our product offerings including the longterm lease of our bodyworn andor incar audiovideo hardware together with a monthly subscription for our cloud storage search and archiving services for the underlying audio and video material we believe this revenue service model may appeal to our customers in particular our commercial and other nonlaw enforcement customers because it reduces the capital outlay up front and eliminates repairs and maintenance in exchange for level monthly payments for the utilization of the equipment data storage and management services we recently announced the launch of the dvm hd incar video system which we believe will be disruptive in the market and will lead to an expansion of our overall market share in the law enforcement channel the dvm hd system provides full p high definition video at a cost effective price point which is a competitive market advantage for usour international revenues increased to  in  compared to  during  and were aided by approximately  of revenue from the sale our firstvu hd body worn cameras storage systems and extended service agreement to a nonlaw enforcement international customer that will continue for three years this order demonstrates the possibilities of deploying our firstvu hd body cameras globally across various industries and applications in addition to the traditional law enforcement marketwe entered  with a strong balance sheet and liquidity which should be able to support a higher level of product sales and shipments if anticipated orders are forthcoming added ross unrestricted cash and equivalents totaled  million at december   and we had approximately  million in net working capital available at the end of  including  million of accounts receivable and  million of inventory our goal is to reduce inventory levels during  to provide additional funding for operations concluded ross operating results for the year ended december   our total revenue decreased by  to approximately  million compared with revenue of approximately  million in the year ended december   we attribute the decrease to ongoing confusion caused by tasers misleading press release regarding our patents the reexamination of our patent commenced by taser with the uspto and our product quality control issues with our firstvu hd product in addition we believe that taser conspired to keep us out of the marketplace by engaging in improper unethical and unfair competition we expect firstvu hd sales to recover during  as we prosecute the patent lawsuits against taser watchguard and others and resolve our product quality issues we believe the vulink product differentiates our product offerings from our competitors and customers will become more familiar with our patented autoactivation technologyinternational revenue increased to  in  versus  in  our  revenues were aided by approximately  of revenue generated by an order from a nonlaw enforcement international customer for our firstvu hd body worn cameras storage systems and extended service agreement gross profit declined  to  in  versus  in  our gross margin decline is commensurate with the  decline in revenues for the year ended december   and the cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increasing to  from  for the year ended december   we believe that gross margins will improve in  because we have corrected the workmanship and other issues affecting our firstvu hd product during recent quarters including the pcb contamination issue addressed in the second and third quarters  our goal is to improve our margins to  over the longer term based on the expected margins of our newer products in particular the dvm dvm hd and firstvu hd as they continue to gain traction in the marketplace and we increase commercial market penetration in  in addition as revenues increase from these products we will seek to further improve our margins from them through economies of scale and more efficiently utilizing fixed manufacturing overhead components we plan to continue our initiative on more efficient management of our supply chain through outsourcing production quantity purchases and more effective purchasing practicesread moreselling general and administrative sga expenses increased approximately  to  in  versus  a year earlier research and development costs increased  to  in  compared with  in  we are increasing our engineering staff of webbased developers as we expand our offerings to include among other items cloudbased evidence storage and management for our law enforcement customers vuvaultnet and our webbased commercial fleet driver monitoring and management tool fleetvu manager we have several active new projects in development along with multiple upgrades to our existing products selling advertising and promotional expense rose  to  compared with  in  the increase is primarily attributable to our becoming the title sponsor in  of the webcom tour golf tournament held annually in the kansas city metropolitan area our net promotional expense related to the  tournament was  compared with  for the  tournament an increase of  professional fees and related expenses rose  to  last year compared with  a year earlier the increase in professional fees and expenses is primarily attributable to higher litigation expenses related to the utility taser and watchguard lawsuits we expect litigation expense to trend higher during  as we commence the jury trial in the utility lawsuit and discovery activities in the taser and watchguard lawsuits we intend to pursue recovery from utility taser watchguard their insurers and other responsible parties as appropriate executive support and administrative staff payroll expenses increased to  in the most recent year compared with  a year earlier this increase is attributable to hiring additional technical support staff to handle field inquiries and installation matters because our installed customer base has expanded further we required additional technical and marketing support for our newer products such as the dvm hd vulink and firstvu hd and in particular the new cloudbased vuvaultnet and fleetvu manager servicebased products executive payroll increased over prior year levels as key employees and certain executives received raises or bonuses after several years of salaries being frozenwe
