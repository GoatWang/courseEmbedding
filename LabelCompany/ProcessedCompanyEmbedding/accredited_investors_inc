insights  news ross levin in the wall street journal on cybercrime and identity theft ross levin ceo  founder of accredited investors wealth management recently spoke with the wall street journal on the topic of cybercrime and identity theft levin recounted a recent incident in which a hacker had accessed a client’s email account and requested a  wire transfer the request itself claiming that the money was needed for a down payment on an investment property was entirely plausible the client’s spouse is a real estate developer and such an investment would not be unusual however the fact that the request was received via email raised a red flag tags identity theft accredited investors wealth management named to  financial times  top registered investment advisers accredited investors

country click here for details tags firm news ft accredited expands parental leave policy as reported by bloomberg news and the washington post a recent study concluded that parental leave benefits have decreased on average throughout much of the country in recent years after undertaking a comprehensive review of its own policies however accredited investors wealth management recently announced a broad expansion of its parental leave benefits for both primary and nonprimary parents providing up to  weeks of fully paid leave and placing the firm at the forefront of its industry with its approach to parental time off tags firm news the upside of uncertainty today’s inauguration of donald trump as president of the united states serves as proof positive that yes  really did happen a year full of improbabilities becoming realities served as a good reminder that since the future is inherently unknowable a sound investment strategy should never be based simply on attempts to predict shortterm events in the investment world january is sometimes referred to as the “silly season” when market prognosticators emerge from their dens to enlighten the world with their predictions of how the market will perform in the coming year we’ve never placed any value in such prophecies and we are not alone in his  shareholder letter warren buffett noted that he and his business partner had “long felt that the only value of stock forecasters is to make fortune tellers look good” tags commentary jake stancyzk joins accredited investors wealth management accredited investors wealth management™ is pleased to welcome jake stanczyk cfp® to the firm’s wealth management team “jake is an exciting addition to our growing firm” said becky krieger senior director for wealth management teams “jake’s experience and ability to multitask will be greatly appreciated by the team” tags press release levin tax cuts appear likely here’s how that affects you what do we know will happen in  actually very little we know that there is going to be a new us president we know that there is a supreme court opening we know that there are going to be several elections taking place in europe there are many more things that we expect but don’t know when evaluating what decisions to make though we are better off looking at scenarios that are more likely than not and appropriately weighing them rather than assuming changes will occur based on expectations from candidate statements tags gains  losses levin this year skip the resolutions and try designing your life rather than spending new year’s eve on resolutions what if you decided you were going to spend january designing your life prof dave evans and prof bill burnett of stanford write in their book “designing your life how to build a welllived joyful life” “your life is not a thing it’s an experience the fun comes from designing and enjoying the experience” tags spend your life wisely dow  technically not “fake news” but about as useful in the spring of  after years of a hardcharging bull market the dow jones industrial average first hit  it was a momentous occasion and the many traders on the floor of the new york stock exchange celebrated with “dow ” hats little did they know that sadly those hats would again become relevant more than  years later when the dow would once again climb back to that notable level after plunging southward during the global financial crisis in  more than seven years on from that point the dow now stands poised to eclipse the  level while its doubtful that many dow  hats will be donned at the nyse – only partly due to the fact that there just aren’t that many human traders left on the floor of the exchange – it is a significant milestone or at least it will be treated as such in reality the dow index is a nonsensical measure that tells us virtually nothing of value about the market and it is cited purely out of entrenched habit at this point tags commentary levin to
