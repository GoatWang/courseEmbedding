discretion in determining whether the feeder fund should repurchase units the board will consider a variety of operational business and economic factors the adviser anticipates that it will recommend to the board that the feeder fund repurchase units from investors on a quarterly basis commencing with the first fiscal quarter after two full years of fund operations with the repurchases to occur as of the last day of march june september and december or if any such date is not a business day on the immediately preceding business day the feeder fund generally will not repurchase units unless the

consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the  act and the extent to which the participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants � v discussion � � a background in its  study entitled protecting investors a half century of investment company regulation �protecting investors� the commission�s division of investment management recognized that the  act imposes a rigid classification system that dictates many important regulatory consequences for example the characterization of a management company as �openend� or �closedend� has historically been crucial to the determination of the degree of liquidity the fund�s shareholders will have and thus the liquidity required of the fund�s investments historically except as noted below there has been no middle ground between the two extremes of the openend and the closedend forms openend funds have offered complete liquidity to their shareholders and thus required a high degree of liquidity of the underlying investment portfolio while closedend funds have been subject to requirements that in fact restrict the liquidity they are permitted to offer their investors under this bipolar system of regulation neither form has provided the best vehicle for offering portfolios that have �  securities and exchange commission staff report protecting investors may  at  �  table of contents significant but not complete liquidity in protecting investors the staff of the commission determined that given the changes in the securities market since  � in particular the emergence of semiliquid investment opportunities � it was appropriate to reexamine the classification system and its regulatory requirements and that it would be appropriate to provide the opportunity for investment companies to �chart new territory� between the two extremes of the openend and the closedend forms consistent with investor protection one exception to the openendclosedend dichotomy cited in protecting investors has been the socalled �prime rate fund� many of these funds first introduced in  invest in adjustable rate senior loans and provide shareholders liquidity through quarterly repurchases �closedend tender offer funds� shortly after protecting investors was published the commission proposed rule c under the  act which provided flexibility to increase shareholder liquidity through periodic tender offers under simplified procedures rule c was adopted in april  prime rate funds were cited in both protecting investors and the rule c proposing release as the prototype for the closedend interval fund concept developments since the initial closedend interval funds make further innovation appropriate many funds either cannot or choose not to rely on rule c therefore there exist a large number of closedend tender offer funds which fall between openend and closedend designations in regard to their operations but are not interval funds moreover a number of precedents exist for the implementation of a multipleclass system and the imposition �  id at   inv co act rel no� july   the �rule c proposing release�  inv co act rel no� april   the commission also had

voting provisions of section�i of the  act a registered closedend investment company may have only one class of stock that is a senior security in particular section�c of the  act provides in relevant part that it shall be unlawful for any registered closedend investment company    to issue or sell any senior security which is a stock if immediately thereafter such company will have outstanding more than one class of senior security which is a stock except that  �  table of contents any such class of    stock may be issued in one or more series provided that no such series shall have a preference or priority over any other series upon the distribution of the assets of such registered closedend company or in respect of the payment of interest or dividends� section�i of the  act provides in relevant part that except as provided in subsection a�of this section or as otherwise required by law every share of stock hereafter issued by a registered management company�shall be a voting stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding voting stock provided that this subsection shall not apply�to shares issued in accordance with any rules regulations or orders which the commission may make permitting such issue the multiple class system proposed herein the �multiple class system� may result in units of a class having �priority over another class as to�payment of�dividends� and having unequal voting rights because under the multiple class system �unitholders of different classes may pay different distribution fees different shareholder service fees and any other expenses as described above in section iic that should be properly allocated to a particular class and �each class would be entitled to exclusive voting rights with respect to matters solely related to that class applicants state that the creation of multiple classes of units of the feeder fund may thus be prohibited by section�c and may violate section�i of the  act applicants believe that the implementation of the multiple class system will provide the applicants with the flexibility to create new classes of units without having to create new feeder funds applicants believe that current and future unitholders will benefit if new classes of units with different pricing structures are created providing investors with enhanced investment options under the multiple class system an investor will be able to choose the method of purchasing units that the investor deems most beneficial based on factors applicable to the �  table of contents investor such as the amount of the purchase the length of time the investor expects to hold the units the use of a financial intermediary through which the units will be purchased and other relevant factors the proposed system would permit the feeder fund to facilitate the distribution of units and provide investors with a broader choice of unitholder options by contrast if the applicants were required to create new separate feeder funds rather than new classes of units the creation of the new separate feeder funds would involve increased costs and administrative burdens borne by unitholders as compared to the creation of additional classes of units of the feeder fund under the multiple class system holders of each class of units may be relieved of a portion of the fixed costs normally associated with investing in investment companies because these costs potentially would be spread over a greater number of units than they would be if the classes were separate funds or portfolios as the feeder fund grows in volume of assets it is expected that investors will derive benefits from economies of scale that might not be available at smaller volumes the commission has long recognized that multiple class arrangements can be structured so that the concerns underlying the  act�s �senior security� provisions are satisfied after having granted numerous exemptive orders �multiple class exemptive orders� to openend management investment companies permitting those funds to issue two or more classes of shares representing interests in the same portfolio in  the commission adopted rule f under the  act which now permits openend funds to maintain or create multiple classes without seeking individual multiple class exemptive orders as long as certain conditions are met �  see inv co act rel no� february   as adopted rule f under the  act creates an exemption for openend funds that issue multiple classes of shares with varying arrangements for the distribution of securities and the provision of services to shareholders in connection with the adoption of rule f the commission also amended rule b under the  act to clarify that each class of shares must have separate b plan provisions moreover any action on the b plan ie director or shareholder approval must take place separately for each class the commission has adopted amendments to rule f that expand and clarify the methods by which a multiple class fund may allocate income gains and losses and expenses and that clarify the shareholder voting provisions of the rule �  table of contents applicants believe that the proposed multiple class system does not raise the concerns underlying section� of the  act to any greater degree than openend investment companies� multiple class structures the multiple class system does not relate to borrowings and will not adversely affect the feeder fund�s assets in addition the proposed system will not increase the speculative character of the feeder fund�s units applicants also believe that the proposed allocation of expenses relating to distribution and voting rights is equitable and will not discriminate against any group or class of unitholders applicants believe that the rationale for and the conditions contained in rule f are as applicable to a closedend investment company seeking to offer multiple classes of shares with varying distribution and service arrangements in a single portfolio as they are to openend investment companies the feeder fund will comply with the provisions of rule f as if it were an openend investment company including among others the rule�s provisions relating to differences in expenses special allocations of other expenses voting rights conversion features exchange privileges and disclosure in fact the feeder fund will in many ways resemble an openend investment company in its manner of operation and in the distribution of units except for differences related to repurchases in particular the feeder fund proposes to offer units continuously at net asset value it is anticipated that differences among classes will as detailed above relate largely to differences in placementdistribution and service arrangements and whether a frontend sales charge applies applicants note that openend and closedend funds are subject to different technical provisions governing the issuance of senior securities however those technical differences do not appear �  table of contents relevant here while closedend funds may not issue multiple classes of shares without exemptive relief the commission has granted specific exemptive relief to numerous similarlysituated closedend funds provisions regulating the issuance by closedend funds of debt or preferred stock should have no bearing on an application by a closedend fund for an exemptive order permitting the issuance of multiple classes of shares therefore applicants propose to base the conditions under which the feeder fund would issue multiple classes of units on those contained in rule f applicants believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights relating to the assetbased distribution andor service fees applicable to classes of the feeder fund in the manner required by rule f is equitable and will not discriminate against any group of unitholders the feeder fund is also aware of the need for full disclosure of the proposed multiple class system in its confidential memorandum or prospectus and of the differences among the various classes and the different expenses of each class of units offered applicants represent that these distribution andor service fees will comply with the provisions of nasd conduct rule  applicants also represent that the feeder fund will disclose in its confidential memorandum or prospectus

tender offers for a portion of their shares to implement multipleclass structures accordingly applicants believe that there is ample precedent for the implementation of a multipleclass system by the feeder fund � � c assetbased distribution andor service fees applicants also request an order pursuant to section�d of the  act and rule d thereunder to the extent necessary to permit the feeder fund to impose assetbased distribution andor service fees in a manner similar to rule b fees for an openend investment company section�b of the  act and rule b thereunder do not apply to closedend investment companies accordingly no provisions of the  act or the rules thereunder explicitly limit the ability of a closedend fund to impose an assetbased distribution andor service fee section�d of the  act prohibits an affiliated person of or a principal underwriter for a registered investment company or an affiliated person of such a person or principal underwriter acting as principal from effecting any transaction in which such registered company or a company controlled by such registered company is a joint or a joint and several participant in contravention of commission regulations rule d provides that no joint �  see supra n  applicants do not concede that section�d applies to the multiple class system or to the assetbased distribution andor service fees discussed herein but request this order to eliminate any uncertainty �  table of contents transaction covered by the rule may be consummated unless the commission issues an order upon application permitting the transaction in reviewing applications pursuant to section�d and rule d the commission considers whether an investment company�s participation in a joint enterprise or joint arrangement is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the  act and the extent to which the participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants section�d of the  act is intended to prevent or limit abuses arising from conflicts of interest however section�d itself does not prohibit any specific activities but instead authorizes the commission to approve rules to limit or prevent an investment company from being a joint participant on a different or less advantageous basis than other participants under rule d it is unlawful for an affiliated person of or a principal underwriter for a registered investment company acting as principal to participate in or effect any transaction in connection with a joint enterprise or other joint arrangement in which the investment company is a participant without prior commission approval the protections provided for in section�d essentially allow the commission to set standards for all transactions concerning an investment company and an affiliate which could be construed as selfdealing or overreaching by the affiliate to the detriment of the investment company the feeder fund will comply with the protections for openend investment companies developed and approved by the commission in rule b in connection with its distribution and service plans if any with respect to each class as if the feeder fund were an openend investment company therefore the feeder fund will participate in substantially the same way and under substantially the same conditions as would be the case with an openend investment company imposing assetbased distribution andor service fees under rule b applicants �  table of contents note that at the same time the commission adopted rule b it also adopted rule d to provide an exemption from section�d and rule d to the extent necessary for arrangements between openend funds and their affiliated persons or principal underwriters or affiliated persons of such persons or principal underwriters whereby payments are made by the openend fund with respect to distribution if such agreements are entered into in compliance with rule b in its adopting release the commission stated the commission wishes to emphasize that it has no intention of categorizing certain transactions as raising the applicability of section�d and rule d of the  act the commission�s only comment is that to the extent that arrangements in which a fund pays for its distribution costs could involve the fund in a �joint enterprise� with an affiliated person and if such arrangements were entered into in compliance with rule b the commission sees no need for prior commission review and approval of the arrangements applicants believe that any section�d concerns the commission might have in connection with the feeder fund�s financing the distribution of its units should be resolved by the feeder fund�s undertakings to comply with the provisions of rule b and rule d as if those rules applied to closedend investment companies accordingly applicants undertake to comply and undertake that the feeder fund�s distribution fee if any will comply with the provisions of rule b and rule d as if those rules applied to closedend investment companies applicants believe that the requested relief meets the standards of section�c of the  act rule c under the  act permits openend investment companies to impose cdscs subject to certain conditions although the feeder fund does not anticipate imposing cdscs applicants would only do so in compliance with rule c as if that rule applied to �

scheduled variations of the cdscs uniformly to all unitholders of a given class and consistently with the requirements of rule d under the  act finally to the extent the feeder fund determines to waive impose scheduled variations of or eliminate the early withdrawal fee it will do so consistently with the requirements of rule d under the  act and the feeder fund�s waiver of scheduled variation in or elimination of the early withdrawal fee will apply uniformly to all unitholders of the feeder fund � vi applicants� condition the applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief

� vii corporate action the feeder fund�s limited liability company agreement empowers the board of the feeder fund to establish different classes of units and to take such other action with respect to
