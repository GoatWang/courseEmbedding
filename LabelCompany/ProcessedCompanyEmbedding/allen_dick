there are still thousands of chopper enthusiasts who dont know who dick allen was this little section of the site will hopefully help to give this man the credit he richly deserves and educate newcomers in some of the historical information that surrounds our shared interests dick allen was truly a legend in his own time and you cant say this about to many people note that most of the images embedded in this article came from darcy allen dicks daughter the shamrock fabrication site by irish rich from his applied machete blog and the motorcycleart webzine motorcycleartblogspotcom owned by chris kallas darcy came down to california this year  and managed to meet a lot of people that worked with her father shes shown below sitting on joe hursts chrome bike formerly dicks wheeler dealer unfortunately i was in texas so we only communicated by telephone needless to say i was surprised as hell that dick had a daughter as all i remembered were his two boys it was an honor to talk with her especially since she plans on continuing to explore her fathers legacy in whatever way she can     darcy met the current owner of dicks locomotion frame and is in the process of trying to buy it back so it stays in the family at least they let her hold the old repainted gas tank for a few minutes     after talking with darcey i began calling everybody i knew who had contact with dick over the years im going to give her the old fork set her dad built for me in  they are in horrible shape so i called irish rich to see if he can find time to schedule them in for refurbishing darcy rides her own harley on a regular basis and spends most of her time doing volunteer work for veterans groups hopefully someday shell be riding her fathers old bike and spreading the allen gospel around the country dick allen was born in rockford illinois in  like a lot of young guys he was drawn towards anything that rolled and it wasnt unusual that he ended up working in a cycle shop when he was only  years old the old shop was at  kishwaukee in rockford and there still is a shop there but it specializes in imports unlike a lot of young guys dicks interest however went beyond just wanting to go fast in a car or on a bike he was fascinated by the mechanical aspects of virtually anything that you could possibly imagine basically he was a selftaught engineer and mechanic with unusual creative talents some say that he verged on being a genius with respect to machines of any kind the first time i met him we ended up having a hour conversation that encompassed a whole range of subjects starting with cars and bikes but extending into speed boats airplanes and shopbuilt tools dick was married for the first time around  and had two children richard jr and drew who as far as i know still live in rockford there is a myth that allen came to california in  as an outsider from illinois but in reality he was well entrenched in the california bike culture since enlisting in the navy nobody knows for sure what he did for the military his first post was in panama but it appears that he was later stationed at some remote site between the el centro air base and what eventually became vincent naval air base near yuma dick was honorably discharged in  and lived near the base in the small town of winter haven where he met and married mary benton in  his second wife dick perfected his machine trades in the military and coincidentally mary was also a machinist and they met while working for the same shop they had two children tracy and darcy  dick worked on bikes in a shop behind their house and was quickly developing a reputation as a good builder mechanic and pretty radical biker for those folks not to familiar with southern california interstate  that runs from san diego to just south of phoenix was originally state highway  started in  to connect the old yuma marine base to the modern world since the highway basically paralleled the mexican border its no wonder that its a stretch of road very popular with biker gangs going all the way back into the fifties most of the land north of road belongs to the military and most of land south of the road is basically uninhabited desert this is where dick allen started his career there have been major bike runs on this stretch of highway going way back into the fifties i think the yuma prison run still happens every year back in the old days there was a notorious house of ill repute that some say was sanctioned by the military but it was the only biker hangout north of the border im not sure but if i remember right it was called imperial gables dick and mary moved to bakersfield around  and then later moved to winnebago illinois around  and divorced the next year dick then married his third wife marge and they and their two children clinton and lee moved to lawndale california in  this is the point for most people where dicks history as one of the south bay builders begins  very few people know that allen was as much into cars as he was into bikes and in fact almost all of his early frame fabrication work involved dragsters a lot of that work took place when he was living in rockford heres a rare picture of him at the oswego drag strip in  hes driving the black chevy     at first glance allen was a pretty intimidating looking guy he was far from being handsome as theyd say in gentlemans quarterly and was well over sixfeet tall and probably weighed around  when i first met him he didnt take kindly to strangers but if you bothered to introduce yourself youd soon get a big smile and a firm handshake you immediately knew that you were meeting somebody who had no veneers what you saw is what you got and it was all genuine with no ego involved i dont want to sound to emo here but he was about as close as ive ever come to meeting somebody who had an almost zen like quality in their personality dick was only around years old when i first met him but he already looked like he was forty ive been told that he had a hard life but i think maybe it was more like a fast life as a lot of us had back in those days some folks have faulted him for personality quirks because dick basically lived his life for himself he didnt care what others thought and for this reason he was often seen as being somewhat aloof or distant and uncaring maybe even selfish or selfcentered but i never saw that aspect in the man if anything it was the reverse he was passionate about everything and everybody he was especially passionate about bike runs and parties if he had any faults more than what most of us have it was that he compartmentalized virtually everything this is not an uncommon trait seen in people that are consider gifted or eccentric dick had a compartment for everything and i think this let him organize his life as he saw it he had several extended families but they were always separated and compartmentalized and it wasnt until long after his death that a lot of these people finally found each other   darcy sent the snapshot above that shows her dad in bakersfield back in  and this may be the oldest photograph anybody has ever seen of mr allen sitting one one of his bikes this is the original chrome bike a  pan many people have told me that this bike was the one that eventually evolved into wheeler dealer many years later   this is the same bike in its later incarnation with sportster forks as it existed around  the photo was taken by dicks close friend chuck pilkington this is a magazine scan from a article about dick published shortly after his death     the image above is the same bike in its third iteration named wheeler dealer by roth for the magazine article in  dick didnt really do much different to the bike except install the extended indian girder sissy bar and pipes the original pan motor was swapped for a shovel the tank remained the same throughout the bikes history just a note to the reader about roth i think he must have been related in some way to george bush as he had a habit maybe a compulsion to give everything and everybody around him a nickname if you showed roth a picture hed name it if you showed up in his shop hed give you a nickname if he liked you if you brought in a car or a bike hed give it a name he called me smiley because he never saw me smile he called mike vils fass mikey mike thought he got the name because of his fast bike but roth told me it was because of his hair that looked like it was going fast standing still believe it or not the old wheeler dealer frame still exists after having been bought and sold about five times over the years joe hurst is currently rebuilding the bike having owned it two times himself see the first picture on this page for the current configuration this is a shot of dicks house on th street in lawndale the bikes are white bear owned by joe hurst and dicks locomotion rumor has it that this place was basically a home away from home for dozens of bikers and several of dicks friends lived here on and off for several years   the house is still there today but it looks like somebody subdivided the lot and built apartments in the back where the old garage used to be thats dicks two boys clinton and lee by his third wife marge from rockford seen in the background if youve done much reading about chopper history youre probably already familiar with the parts and components that allen became famous for hes credited with developing the  into  exhaust system first using disk brakes on bikes first using automotive mag and aluminum  rims on bikes and developing improvements in beltdrive systems many people credit him with being the first guy to run a primary belt drive made by using belts from the old  dragster blowers on his own machined pulleys while living in rockford in  ive also been told that he was modifying car wheels and tires to get that widetire look back in  he actually came up with a lot more than these few items and invented countless small innovations for bikes that have become almost commonplace today in general most historians also credit him with being a significant contributor to what became known as the south bay chopper style this shouldnt be confused with the other south bay style that originated up in frisco what were talking about here is a style of bike that first started to appear between  and  in that area of southern california bounded on the north by segundo beach on the south by redondo beach and on the east by the  freeway this area was literally the birthplace of the classic longbike as most of us know it today the region includes the communities of maywood gardenia redondo and manhattan beach compton bellflower lawndale lakewood torrance and hawthorne if you extend the imaginary northern boundary by about  two miles it also encompasses the shop owned by ben hardy and the old shop owned by ed roth this is where chopper history gets interesting because a lot of the legends only lived a few blocks apart from each other there was a continual exchange of ideas between these people and an almost communal sharing of resources parts materials labor services and even complete bikes it was a lot easier to get things done back in those times in that environment than it is today where every shop and every builder almost seem to be odds most of the time i first found dick allen in  because i needed somebody to extend a set of old indian  scout girder forks and his name came up as the guy who did this type of work i lived in kansas at the time and he was a little far away things didnt come together at the time and it wasnt until a few years later that i finally managed to hook up with him this time i came with an introduction from ed roth and had no problem actually finding the man who wasnt all that easy to find in the first place since he didnt really have a shop at the time and worked out of about three different places in lawndale like a lot of us he held down a real job during the day and did his own work after hours i showed him my forks and told him what i needed done he took the forks over to a bandsaw and chopped them into six pieces and handed them back along with some tubing while he made a sketch on the back of some takeout menu he told me to just follow the instructions and weld everything back together per the dimensions he provided and then id be good to go no charge needless to say it didnt work out to well for me once i got back home and i ended up butchering those forks from lack of talent on my end of the equation years later i did rebuild those forks once i learned a little more and as far as i know somebody is still using them on some bike out there somewhere a few months later i needed to have a stock harley springer narrowed and dick allen was again the man to see in fact dicks main claim to fame was in narrowing old stock springers this isnt a simple job and basically involves completely debrazing all the fittings in the stock forks and then cutting bending modifying and rewelding everything back together again dick allen literally became famous for doing this chore but few people realize how significant this simple fact is ten hours and two cases of beer later plus a twenty dollar bill and i had a nice set of narrowed forks and a ton of new knowledge the picture below is dicks first houseshop behind what used to be kens transway transmission shop where he worked from  to around early  when they moved down the street to new digs     keep in mind that back in   and nobody had yet come up with the idea of building narrow forks from scratch at  least nobody but dick allen while he was working on my forks he was telling me how we could be doing this easier and cheaper if we just shitcanned the old forks and started from scratch and built a springer from tubing just using the old rockers springs and spring perch from the stock forks i had no idea what he was talking about but it sure sounded good in  i had a chance to see his first set of tube forks based upon this concept and i was immediately sold on the whole deal and bought parts for two forks sets to take back to las vegas plus some sketches he made so i could build more of my own we used these sketches to make some of the drawings for what we call the rude and crude old school springer plans ironically dick didnt bother to actually put his own plans into action until around  the ad below from  in roths little magazine is the first ad dick ever ran for any of his products the forks are his early version of the straightleg idea and utilized the stock harley spring perch and upper tree     fast forward to  and dick allen publicly announces the first ever completely custom built narrow springer forks   this might not seem like a big deal now but his offering of these forks literally changed the entire concept of building a custom bike for the average guy on the street who prior to this invention had to either extend a stock springer or modify their old hydraulic forks dick advertised the forks as being  as seen in the  ad above but in reality if you went by the shop before he went public you could pick up a set in the raw for  this might seem unrealistically cheap but keep in mind that you could buy a fairly decent used big twin for  at the time ironically even though dick invented the massproduced custom chopper springer in the mid sixties by the time he started to run ads several other companies were already selling forks of similar designs based upon his prototypes which he didnt bother to keep secret this really didnt bother him since virtually everybody still knew that an allen springer was the best you could buy so he never wanted for business in fact he had to much business most of the time and routinely sold off parts to other builders i bought his parts and i know that al myer sugar bear also bought components from him im sure other local builders did the same there was plenty of work to go around and dick didnt have an ego problem to stand in his way its worth pointing out at this point that there was back then and still is today an entire chopper industry made up of individuals and small shops who never bother to advertise their products or services yet theyre all overloaded with work the business model is simple its called supporting your local craftsmen stop by the shop bring some beer and lay out your specifications for what you need made or better yet make it yourself if you have the skills it just kills me to see people talking about building a custom bike but they buy everything on the internet with a credit card they end up with what i call a bolton special almost all my contact with dick revolved around frontends either girders or springers so thats what i want to talk about here because i dont know anything about the other aspects of his work we did compare notes on frame building and we had some agreement on certain aspects but a lot of disagreements on other aspects at one time i had a copy of my old frame blueprints that he markedup to show me how to run what was called a raised transmission but i lost those a long time ago  with respect to springer history i do think that dick allen was without a doubt the definitive originator of what most of us call the california ultranarrow springer we even have to go a little beyond that statement because the allen springers in any of their various configurations actually worked and worked exceedingly well he really didnt have any competition in this field at all and no matter how many companies sprang up making forks the allen products fork set was never equaled the main reason for this wasnt because he made nice hardware in fact his forks from a quality standpoint were about average the big difference was that he understood springer geometry and tuning and nobody else realized the importance of this simple fact even the factory mechanics didnt understand how to properly tune springers if you do a lot of reading youve no doubt seen where many of allens ideas were pirated and marketed by other companies and some of this is true and some of it is false dick had a lot of irons in the fire and a lot of friends so he often developed an idea made the pass and then let somebody else carry the ball his exhaust systems were made and marketed by eme and this was all on the up and up he let several people build springers virtually identical to his own without asking for royalties his attitude was basically that whoever actually fabricated something got the pay for it thats not to say that he wasnt rippedoff every time he was in jail and then again after the bike accident his shops were pretty much clearedout sometimes he was forced to sell parts and tools to cover legal and medical expenses but a lot of people took advantage of these situations he never cried over spiltmilk and just keep moving ahead before we switch to the second page of this article id like to just post some photographs from other sites that weve mentioned earlier please visit these sites as they have a ton of good worthwhile info about dick allen for those interested in the man the first shot is from the chris kallas blog and it shows dick on the right on a typical ride but whats interesting is that he riding twoup with a guy nobody but dick allen could get away with doing this and to top it off that guy looks to me like bruce parrish maybe im mistaken but it sure looks like him could also possibly be david mann if this pic is of a hangmen ride if anybody knows the particulars on this snapshot call or email me as im sure there is a ton of history behind this particular run one of dicks business problems was that he liked to ride more than he liked to build in fact he preferred to build and work on what we call rider bikes far more than fancy show bikes and this inclination alienated a lot of the socalled custom builders and potential customers that were his peers update i did receive some info about the photo above and it was taken at a funeral in santa cruz and is actually a still taken from a movie made by gary partlow and john carney dick and some of his friends would occasionally ride up to searchlight nevada on friday nights back in the early sixties for a little party time at the casino vegas was not a bikerfriendly town so if you wanted some of the freedom of nevada but you rode a bike you usually stopped short of town at searchlight and visited the el ray for a little action     the el ray and a lot of the other clubs were officially closed somewhere around  when searchlight was suckedup into clark county but all they really did was go underground i actually moved way out on blue diamond road south of vegas proper just so id be closer to searchlight since this is where most of the bikers would congregate on weekends i met my first wife there but at a burger drivein and not the el ray actually the ride up from los angles to vegas is a truly incredible bike trip and one that can typically made at full speed so that stretch of highway was basically a race track for guys with hot bikes back in the day once you crossed over into nevada there was no speed limit so it was ballstothewall may the fastest iron horse win dicks regular crew on some of these runs was mike vils chuckie buzzard foot and tiny i dont want to break away from writing about dick allen but but when i was contacted by darcy i broke open some old boxes that had stored since the early seventies and the memories started to flow back into my mind sometimes we get dulled by the passage of time and forget what the old days were really like looking back now that period of time for me as a babyboomer from  to  was an almost perfect time to be alive there was nothing that we couldnt do and the man pretty much turned a blind eye to it all things started to change in late  or early  and paranoia started to set in everywhere if your were a biker in  you were cool if you were a biker in  you were meat for the political grist mill in  the city of hermosa beach actually tried to introduce a complete ban on motorcycles within the city limits it only got worse as time moved forward by  if you rode a modified bike you literally became a moving target for law enforcement by  i personally believe that most bikers were routinely stopped just because they rode motorcycles if you just so happened to also have long hair you were shitupa creek i was almost beaten to death by a cop in  just for parking in the wrong spot but a few angels helped me out otherwise i wouldnt be here today i wasnt even riding a chopped bike as all i had then was my commuter a small triumph a lot of people mostly the chopper magazine folks still today try to smoothover the issues between the law and bikers that existed between  and  the younger guys today have no idea of how lucky they are to have missed all of that drama we had cops bust into one of our camps in big sur and burn our bikes with the excuse that there must have been a fuel leak that got into the campfire the men were taken to court charged with violating the ancient mann act of trafficking young women for prostitution across state lines the women we had with us were charged with prostitution fortunately all charges were dropped in court and our gang was dropped at the state line with no bikes and no money this wasnt an unusual situation for bikers back then and im sure almost everybody who lived through those times have similar horror stories they can recount allen was trying to do business right in the middle of this period of socalled social transition and dick allen was not what youd call a politically correct type of guy by any stretch of the imagination so he had his ups and downs with law enforcement over the course of several years probably the worse runin occurred in  when he was busted for riding around on one of his cobra trikes than had a pot leaf laminated in under the clearcoat he ended up serving sixmonths of a five year sentence for possession that kind of gives you an idea of how bad things were back then between the law and bikers this next shot is a classic and its been spread all around the web i suppose the guys at the boutique discussion boards would call this grunge style so it could be properly classified im still not to sure i understand some of these various boards as they seem to be caught up in styles and fashions more so than in building or riding bikes but i guess im just behind the times   as you can see dick did not have a big ego and he wasnt much of what wed call a fashionista for folks that never knew dick in person you can get a slight inkling of how big this guy was when you look at the size of his hand over that grip handle and size of his boot joe hurst used to call this iteration of dicks putt as seen above the rat fuck bike this has to be a relatively late photo as it clearly shows the fullydeveloped concept of his early production version of the mass produced springer im guessing this is from  or  somebody has to know the history behind this snapshot and i hope that theyll send me an email this is probably the first version of the bike that came to be known as locomotion one telltale is the swastika clutch pedal even though this is a black and white photo you can easily see that the chips on this frame match the chips seen in other pictures of what people call the red frame bike there is the big headlamp the z bars the band where the tiewrap used to be located and biggest telltale are the cheap aluminum foot pegs this this next photo was taken in the shop around  and clearly shows one of the cobra trikes being mockedup about a year before it supposedly existed whats interesting is the bike frame sitting on top of the trike frame this particular trike was never finished and i havent run across anybody who knows what happened to the motor the bike on the right is one of the various incarnations of locomotion ii still wearing the old tank paint from nasty nezs nez nesbit of phase iii original locomotion fortunately this is an old polaroid so we have a date stamp of november  there is some controversy over this particular frame some have said this frame actually became white bear owned by joe hurst while others have told me it became locomotion im inclined to believe that the later story is true since joes bike had the sidecar hoops cut and molded while dick left them stock on his frame whatever happened we know that both joe and dick road this bike as seen here on several occasions i think ive seen joe quoted as saying that it was basically a shop bike heres a shot taken from another web site and credited with being joe hurst jamming on the rat bike and its pretty easy to see that its the red frame bike   but heres another picture of a bike that people also called dicks rat bike and its the cradle frame bike with the black tank seen sitting on top of the trike frame     the redframed bike with nezs old tank on it was dicks research  development bike and it went through a bunch of evolutions over time the picture below shows it with a vincent motor installed for fans of dick allen there remains some controversy about locomotion and white bear with respect to one another since joe was quoted at some website as saying that dick liked white bear so much that he copied it i seriously doubt that joe actually made that statement since its fairly obvious from the record that locomotion was being ridden by dick before white bear came into existence at one web site joe is quoted as saying that they stopped along the way during one of their cross country trips to give some guy a deposit for building the frame for white bear this is another story that gets changed around depending on who youre talking with as several people have told me that the frame for white bear was the same frame that joe used on his older hustler bike what a lot of people dont realize nowadays is that most builders back then took in almost any type of fab or welding jobs that came in the front door just so they could do this kind of stuff at the backdoor even the best fabricators could not make a living just by building bikes and if you were lucky enough to get a job at one of these shops youd likely be welding bumperhitches or making bbq grilles to pay the rent the good work usually happened after hours dicks sign outside his first two shops simply said  dick allen choppers and welding allen never saw a bike as being a barhopper for him riding was serious business and long distance riding was one of his passions he invented the auxiliary fuel tank for longhaul runs and the well circulated photo below shows his rig on locomotion sitting out front of the shop in gardena around  at one time allen and some of his friends started riding to sturgis via rockford which a pretty long detour but it became an annual run and eventually one of  the cycle magazines teamed up with him and they officially called this the dick allen dash which became a fairly significant long distance endurance run dick actually missed the start of the first run and had to play catchup with the rest of the pack only to end up having his bike stolen in denver dick even invented a whole bunch of specialized tools but he actually tried to commercially sell his version of an enginetranny work fixture like everything else he did it was copied and made and sold cheaper by dozens of other people as far as i know dick was never a member of any official club but if anybody organized a club ride dick allen was usually invited he was one of the few lonewolves who was seldom alone on the road from what i gather he had some close friends in the hangmen and el forastero clubs i know several of the hangmen had his front ends on their bikes of course looking back now i suppose anybody who was serious about riding back then had one of his forks sets dick allens memory seems close to most of us builders today who knew him as a friend but we need to keep in mind that most of us who knew him those of us who are still living werent actually part of his original peer group allen was a product of the bobber and chopper builders of the fifties not the sixties as we normally associate him he started building bikes in  this is a fact a lot of us tend to forget by the time the sixties rolled around he already had a lot of experience and by the seventies he had firmly established his own unique style for many of us boomers allen was a living legend a mentor and a friend who always had time to give you some of his own time which is a rare thing this is one reason that dick seemed to attract a huge following of up and comers way back in the old days a lot of these youngsters would eventually become legends themselves thanks in part to some of dicks wisdom  heres a great picture of dick taken around      the guy with his back to the camera is randy smith when he was working for custom chopper magazine under the pseudonym of bud wiser thats randys press camera that dicks holding dicks wearing another shop shirt i dont think i ever saw him in a civilian shirt but he seemed to have an endless supply of uniforms from a variety of businesses for some reason while were on the subject of dick allen and the media i think that folks need to understand once and for all that chopper magazines exist for only one purpose and thats to make money from advertising the mags dont care one bit about the content that goes into the rag so long as each issues sells more advertising revenue thats just a fact of life when it came to dick allen however many if not all of the stringers photographers staff writers and even some of the publishers were drawn to him like a magnet even though he usually refused to do any significant advertising of his products his shop became a hangout for media types over the years because they got to see the socalled biker lifestyle lived out before their very eyes keep in mind that the vast majority of magazine people back in the day didnt even ride bikes i think i remember about tree staff writers who actually owned a motorcycle i know of several articles written about some of dicks products and related work that have never been published simply because he wouldnt pay for advertising space in some magazine from day one dick always felt that the best advertising was via word of mouth and he stayed with that concept to the very end one exmagazine guy i talked with said his old outfit probably had over a hundred dick allen related pictures in the archives that will never be published or released to the public another interesting thing about dick allen was that he never really promoted his own business at least not within the time period i knew him i never saw any dick allen bling like decals shirts or hats in fact he seldom ran any magazine ads beyond the few other people have posted at various sites on the other hand he was pretty active in promoting other businesses owned by his friends and even had their shop decals on a lot of his builds youll never find a dick allen products decal anywhere because he never made any you wont find any dick allen shirts or hats anywhere because he never made any the vintage ones you find today were made by people who did so without dicks endorsement as far as i know nobody making some of this dick allen bling nowadays has even asked the family permission to do so most if not all of dicks original group of friends are long gone and those of us who remain and had a chance to ride with him were his second tier of friends the younger guys who hung around the shops in the late sixties and early seventies while he worked on our projects this is one reason that there are two different levels of old stories about dick one level almost mythic are the stories handed down from the old guys and then there is the second level that a lot of us can recount from first hand experiences interesting is the fact that you can ask a single question to a group of his surviving friends and get numerous completely different answers some of this dichotomy can be laid directly at the doorstep of the chopper rags back in the day who literally madeup many of the stories they published these mags also stirred up the shit when they could and a good example of this was an article about dick allen challenging anybody anywhere with any type of bike to race him cross country from la to chicago needless to say this stirred up the pot in the motorcycle industry and a lot of people were just looking to get some good publicity from beating dick at his own game i need to inject some preamble here as dick had a reputation for decades of having the fastest bikes on the planet so he was always a big target of the socalled performance crowd in the industry i can say from personal experience that he did have some incredibly fast bikes but it was actually his riding style that won him races against much faster bikes to put it simply he just ran flatout ballstothewall on any and all roads and in the twisters he usually beat his competition by shear guts alone i have no idea who actually won that race as it eventually disintegrated into just a big party but by mid point dick was already a full day ahead of the rest of the pack despite getting started a day late   you can click on the picture to see a larger image of the magazine article even today for his friends its sometimes hard to separate myth and legend from fact largely because dicks life was almost mythic even while he was still alive this is in stark contrast to what you see today concerning other famous builders who will probably never be remembered for doing much of anything except building a couple of show bikes on some television program what is somewhat ironic is that a couple of people ive called to gather more information about dick actually want to be paid to tell their stories i seriously doubt that these types of people could have really been his friends darcy summed it up perfectly when she told me that dick experimented improved and then built choppers so that other people could ride and enjoy having a properly modified bike and not some monstrosity built by a celebrity he cared not for fame or fortune and sought out neither during his lifetime he didnt run a shop that sold glitz and bling for inflated prices he didnt rip people off for services and basically he lived by the golden rule of do unto others as you would have them do unto you dick was into bikes for the pure joy and excitement of the ride and this is probably the real reason he became a legend somebody in the industry was once quoted as saying that dicks word was better than any printed legal guarantee offered by any manufacturer anywhere at anytime     after a wild and exciting life dick allen died peacefully in his sleep at chuck pilkingtons house on august   as the result of a brain injury received in an auto accident and then aggravated by his cycle accident he is missed by literally hundreds of people darcy has started a nonprofit organization called the dick allen memorial foundation and funds raised by the group will go towards helping bikers and families of bikers who have had an accident or other bad runs of luck if youd like to donate anything to the group contact darcy via email at darcyallenaolcom donations can be in any form including cash goods or services and will be tax deductible darcy is also putting together a book about her father so anybody who knew dick and has a story to tell should contact her the objective is to prepare a biography where each of his friends will have a separate chapter so the final work will be a testimony to dicks life and the lives of those who rode with him follow the links below to other pages go to the dick allen picture pages go to the dick allen

“the history of the chopper” jesse did on the discovery channel it brought back memories of dick allen back in the day i was fresh out of the marine corps in  i bought a hd three wheeler and chopped it up saw the dick allen springer frontend around the south bay and had to have one but i could not find dick allen he must have been in jail again i did find out about a machine shop on artesia blvd in south redondo beach where dick worked in his early years it turned out to be true pops at  rivers run bob t in background i went in and asked the old machinist for a dick allen springer frontend he said “go ask dick allen” my response “dick is nowhere to be found heard he was in jail” he yells back “sound’s about right” i came back the next day and went over the build for the new springer a few weeks went by when i got the call and the frontend was done it still was a dick allen springer because this old guy worked hand ‘n hand with dick at the beginnings of the front end the springer was in the corner of the shop going over to it i yelled “where’s the chrome” his come back was “does this look like a chrome shop” off to find a chrome shop i go then i mounted it on the old trike dick allen narrow springer front end side view—a classic eights months later i sold the trike for enough money to buy my new shovelhead as time rolled on i met dick allen with some of the south bay guys i was riding with going to his shop was always an adventure i learned always bring beer or other party favors with you this was a good trade for work dick allen collector i picked up a  spoke inch mag magnesium rim off drag cars for the rear of the rigid shovel all of us knew him as “pop” he was the only one at the time who adapted the car wheel for a motorcycle being a inch wheel there was no motorcycle tires on the market so we ran a car tire a  or  i ran a  pirelli radial with low psi for better handling dick was the first to introduce large tires this was a car radial  dick was definitely ahead of his time he developed the belt drive disc brakes the long narrow springer frontend that worked stainless steel one piece oil lines into exhaust collector and many other items which he never got credit for pop lived the life to the fullest each day  spoke mag with a  pirelli i am still running the  spoke mag today except with  inch avon tire his shop was a cool place to hang once in awhile we never knew what he would come up with next once he took a chevy  and put it in a hd trike rolled out and hit the throttle it had so much torque it twisted and threw the trike into a telephone pole just another day at the shop  spoke mag with an avon one thing that stands out was about  we left the south bay for the kern river run on memorial day weekend meeting up with a bunch of the so cal guys we stayed a day at kern river and than split to three rivers up north where there was a party on someone’s property can’t quite remember a band was playing and there were lots of party favors everyone was loaded to the sky at night a barn fire was blazing i remember everyone was dancing in the blaze of the fire including pop it was one hell of a weekend run one of many monday night it was homeward bound for all running in the holiday traffic i missed the turnoff for fuel and ended riding by myself in this madness home but then in my rear view mirror i noticed a light flicking in the distance moving fast down the white line of traffic it was pop he slowed that old knucklehead down looked over at me said “hey kid lets go” classic pan from the era i was in my early s then off we went down the white line so fast the cars looked blurred i swear it was the twilight zone i guess i was as loaded as pop i will never forget this dick allen was a pioneer for the industry he was a true biker and rebel rest in peace bob t dick allen tribute girl from sam dixon loading… share this story tweet back to profiles special reports reader comments there is a guy named fat lou aka

your browser doesnt support them mc artmotorcycle art dick allen chopper hero skip to main  skip to sidebar friday june   dick allen chopper hero as a kid buying chopper magazines certain individuals took on rock star status one of those guys was dick allen any time a magazine featured something related to dick you knew it would be cooldicks bike as featured in choppers magazine oct  here you can see how the secondary sissy bar bolts to the fender and at the bar up toptake note of the art and also that skinny  front wheelduring this period not too many ran a stock bobbed harley fender on this style of chopperreally tall stacks a slight crackits interesting how time changes things at that time many guys dumped their panheads in a flash for the better performance of a shovel so why did dick go from a pan to a shovel then latter a knuckle some say knucks are the bestan earlier photo of what appears to be the same bike forks are early sportster that look to be fitted with slugs for extension check the area between trees the trees look raked and the lower one still has the fork boot mounts attached the antique  front rim and spokes was still black at this timea later shot of dick on his knuckle locomotion sporting some of his trademark features  spoke mag with car radial tire swooping sissy bar support long narrow springer  to  collector exhaust cobra seat tall zbars and sportster headlight these features became almost a standard for the south bay beach cities laed newtons art for roths tshirts and decals tall pipes indian forks tall skinny front wheel and a crazy bearded rider was this inspired by the wheelie incident or drawn before and later modified for the article this could have been dick as newtons california chopper art also seems to be a depiction of beautiful buzzardthe engine here is a shovel and the tanks match dicks paint only ed newton would know the back story posted by chris k at  am labels chopper history choppers magazine dick allen ed roth magazine cover others art  comments mike d said the pan with the sportster front end is one of my favorite bikes of all timethanks for posting pic june   at  am drewallen said ditto i plan on building a replica of that bike love the chrome frame june   at  am pat said great writeup on a great builder and innovator question is the tank on locomotion that is attached to the sissy bar an aux fuel tank august   at  pm chris k said thanks yes thats an aux tank its another feature that some south bay bikes ran im not sure of the origins of this one but ive seen several made from stainless steel fire extinguishers my neighbor who had one said it was because they wouldnt spark if you went down august   at  am pat said fascinating ive looked at hundreds of chopper pics over the years and dont recall seeing an aux tank it really makes sense for a biker who wants to run a small tank and not have to be in range of a gas station every  minutes of riding the reinforced sissy bars on dicks bikes come would be necessary to support the weight of a full aux tank plus gear from what i have been able to gather dick rode the hell out of his bikes they all look bitchin but are total functional at the same time necessary when one actually rides thousands of miles across deserts mountains etc i think that mindset has been missing from the bike scene since dick passed thanks again for the great writeup im hungry for every scrap of info i can get on dick and his bikes august   at  pm chris k said ill try to get some shots of bikes with aux tanks and dig up what i can on mr allen august

baseball with an authority philadelphia fans had not seen since chuck klein and jimmie foxx phillies scout john ogden convinced the phillies to sign allen in  for a  bonus john ogden played for the international league baltimore orioles from  to  under jack dunn the discoverer of babe ruth and later pitched against ruth in the american league ogden stated in a philadelphia bulletin story printed on july   that dick allen was the only player he ever saw who hit a ball as hard as babe ruth allens playing career got off to a turbulent start as he faced racial harassment while playing for the phillies minor league affiliate in little rock residents staged protest parades against allen the local teams first black player nevertheless he led the league in total bases his first season in the majors  ranks among the greatest rookie seasons ever he led the league in runs  triples  extra base hits  and total bases  he finished in the top five in batting average  slugging average  hits  and

phillies lost the first game of the streak to the cincinnati reds when chico ruiz stole home with frank robinson batting for the games only run in allens autobiography written with tim whitaker crash the life and times of dick allen allen stated that the play broke our humps despite the phillies collapse allen hit  with  doubles  triples  home runs and  rbi in those last  games allen hit a home run off the cardinals ray washburn in  which he cleared connie mack stadiums left center field roof coke sign that home run an estimated footer inspired willie stargell to say now i know why they the phillies fans boo richie all the time when he hits a home run theres no souvenir while playing for philadelphia allen appeared on several allstar teams including the – teams in the latter of these three games he hit a home run off dean chance he led the league in slugging  ops  and extra base hits  in  nonbaseball incidents soon marred allens philadelphia career in july  he got into a fistfight with fellow phillie frank thomas according to two teammates who witnessed the fight thomas swung a bat at allen hitting him in the shoulder johnny callison said thomas got himself fired when he swung that bat at richie in baseball you dont swing a bat at another player—ever pat corrales confirmed that thomas hit allen with a bat and added that thomas was a bully known for making racially divisive remarks allen and his teammates were not permitted to give their side of the story under threat of a heavy fine the phillies released thomas the next day that not only made the fans and local sports writers see allen as costing a white player his job but freed thomas to give his version of the fight in an hourlong interview aired december   on the mlb networks studio  with bob costas allen asserted that he and thomas are in fact good friends now allens name was a source of controversy he had been known since his youth as dick to family and friends but for reasons which are still somewhat obscure the media referred to him upon his arrival in philadelphia as richie possibly a conflation with the longtime phillies star richie ashburncitation needed after leaving the phillies he asked to be called dick saying richie was a little boys name in his dual career as an rb singer the label on his records with the groovy grooves firm slated him as rich allen some of the phillies own fans known for being tough on hometown players even in the best of times exacerbated allens problems initially the abuse was verbal with obscenities and racial epithets eventually allen was greeted with showers of fruit ice refuse and even flashlight batteries as he took the field he began wearing his batting helmet even while playing his position in the field which gave rise to another nickname crash helmet shortened to crashcitation needed he almost ended his career in  after mangling his throwing hand by pushing it through a car headlight allen was fined  and suspended indefinitely in

detroits tiger stadium he lined a homer off the roof facade in deep leftcenter field at a linear distance of approximately  feet  m and an altitude of  feet  m anecdotal and mathematical evidence agreed that allens clout wouldve easily surpassed  ft  m on the fly the sox were favored by many to make the playoffs in  but those hopes were dashed due in large measure to the fractured fibula that allen suffered in june he tried to return five weeks after injuring the leg in a collision with mike epstein of the as but the pain ended his season after just one game in which he batted for in  despite his making the al allstar team in each of the three years with the sox allens stay in chicago ended in controversy when he left the team on september  with two weeks left in the season in his

his voice has drawn comparisons to harptones lead singer willie winfield during allens time with the sixtiesera phillies he sang lead with a doowop group called the ebonistics dick allen and the ebonistics sang professionally at philadelphia night clubs he once entertained during halftime of an nba philadelphia ers game the philadelphia inquirer printed a review of his performance here came rich allen flowered shirt tie sixinches  mm wide hiphugger bellbottomed pants a microphone in his hands rich allen the most booed man in philadelphia from april to october when eagles coach joe kuharich takes over walked out in front of  people at the spectrum last night to sing with his group the ebonistics and a most predictable thing happened he was booed two songs later though a most unpredictable thing happened they cheered rich allen they cheered him as warmly as they have ever cheered him for a gamewinning home run although his music career was not as substantial or longlasting as that of milwaukee braves outfielder arthur lee maye allen gained lasting praise for a recording on the groovy grooves label titled echoes of november the song is featured in the philles official hundredyear anniversary video and the novel  intruder in  brazilian pop star ana volans rerecorded echoes of november her rendition sold briskly in brazil the cds jacket contains a dedication to dick allen and his hall of fame candidacy hall of fame candidacyedit nearly forty years after retiring allen remains a much discussed and still controversial ballplayer an increasing number of baseball historians regard him as the best player not inducted into the baseball hall of fame allen appeared on the hall of fames  golden era committee ballot the committee votes every three years since  when ron santo was elected by the committee of  selected candidates selected by a committee of the baseball writers association of america from the  to  era for consideration of hall of fame enshrinement in  allen and tony oliva were both one vote short of the required  votes by the committee which elected none of the candidates sabermetrician bill james rated dick allen as the secondmost controversial player in baseball history behind rogers hornsby james called allens autobiography crash one of the best baseball books in recent years for many years allen held the distinction of the highest slugging percentage among players eligible for but not in the national baseball hall of fame this only ended in  when albert belle became eligible but was not elected allen barra wrote in his wall street journal sports column that a growing body of baseball historians think that dick allen is the best player eligible for the hall of fame  the arguments usually center around his very high career averages batting  slugging  and onbase  they also point out that he began his career during the mids a period so dominated by pitchers that it is sometimes called the second dead ball era  of the major league batters with  or more career home runs whose play intersected dick allens career at the beginning or end only mickey mantles lifetime ops of  topped dick allens lifetime  ops  his career ops is the second highest of any retired player not in the hall of fame only topped by mark mcgwire allen also played some of his career in pitcherfriendly parks such as busch memorial stadium dodger stadium and comiskey park in addition to hitting for high offensive percentages allen displayed prodigious power before scientific weight training musclebuilding dietary supplements and anabolic steroids allen boasted a powerful and muscular physique along the lines of mickey mantle and jimmie foxx indeed baseball historian bill jenkinson ranks allen with foxx and mantle and just a notch below babe ruth as the four top longdistance sluggers ever to wield a baseball bat a segment of mlb networks prime  concurred with jenkinsons findings on that same broadcast willie mays stated that allen hit a ball harder than any player he had ever seen dick allen like babe ruth hit with a rather heavy bat allens ouncer bucked the ted williamsinspired trend of using a light bat for increased bat speed allen combined massive strength and body torque to produce bat speed and drive the ball two of his drives cleared connie mack stadiums foothigh left field grandstand twice allen cleared that parks foothigh right center field scoreboard a feat considered virtually impossible for a righthanded hitter detractors of allens hall of fame credentials argue that his career was not as long as most hall of famers so he does not have the career cumulative numbers that others do they further argue that the controversies surrounding him negatively impacted his teams hall of fame player willie stargell countered with a historical perspective of dick allens time dick allen played the game in the most conservative era in baseball history it was a time of change and protest in the country and baseball reacted against all that they saw it as a threat to the game the sportswriters were reactionary too they didnt like seeing a man of such extraordinary skills doing it his way it made them nervous dick allen was ahead of his time his views and way of doing things would go unnoticed today if i had been manager of the phillies back when he was playing i would have found a way to make dick allen comfortable i would have told him to blow off the writers it was my observation that when dick allen was comfortable balls left the park the two managers for whom allen played the longest—gene mauch of the phillies and chuck tanner of the white sox—agreed with willie stargell that allen was not a clubhouse lawyer who harmed team chemistry asked if allens behavior ever had a negative influence on the team mauch said never dicks teammates always liked him id take him in a minute according to tanner dick was the leader of our team the captain the manager on the field he took care of the young kids took them under his wing and he played every game as if it was his last day on earth hall of fame player orlando cepeda agreed saying to author tim whitaker dick allen played with fire in his eyes  hall of fame teammate rich gossage also confirmed tanners view in an interview with usa today sports gossage said ive been around the game a long time and hes the greatest player ive ever seen play in my life he had the most amazing season  ive ever seen hes the smartest baseball man ive ever been around in my life he taught me how to pitch from a hitters prospective and taught me how to play the game right theres no telling the numbers this guy could have put up if all he worried about was stats the guy belongs in the hall of fame  another of allens exwhite sox teammates pitcher stan bahnsen said i actually thought that dick was better than his stats every time we needed a clutch hit he got it he got along great with his teammates and he was very knowledgeable about the game he was the ultimate team guy another hall of fame teammate mike schmidt credited dick allen in his book clearing the bases as his mentor in schmidts biography written by historian william c kashatus schmidt fondly recalls allen mentoring him before a game in chicago in  saying to him mike youve got to relax youve got to have some fun remember when you were just a kid and youd skip supper to play ball you were having fun hey with all the talent youve got baseball ought to be fun enjoy it be a kid again schmidt responded by hitting four home runs in that game mike schmidt is quoted in the same book the baseball writers used to claim that dick would divide the clubhouse along racial lines that was a lie the truth is that dick never divided any clubhouse see

in baseball you dont swing a bat at another player—ever pat corrales confirmed that thomas hit allen with a bat and added that thomas was a bully known for making racially divisive remarks allen and his teammates were not permitted to give their side of the story under threat of a heavy fine the phillies released thomas the next day that not only made the fans and local sports writers see allen as costing a white player his job but freed thomas to give his version of the fight in an hourlong interview aired december   on the mlb networks studio  with bob costas allen asserted that he and thomas are in fact good friends now allens name was a source of controversy he had been known since his youth as dick to family and friends but for reasons which are still somewhat obscure the media referred to him upon his arrival in philadelphia as richie possibly a conflation with the longtime phillies star richie ashburncitation needed after leaving the phillies he asked to be called dick saying richie was a little boys name in his dual career as an rb singer the label on his records with the groovy grooves firm slated him as rich allen some of the phillies own fans known for being

unpredictable thing happened they cheered rich allen they cheered him as warmly as they have ever cheered him for a gamewinning home run although his music career was not as substantial or longlasting as that of milwaukee braves outfielder arthur lee maye allen gained lasting praise for a recording on the groovy grooves label titled echoes of november the song is featured in the philles official hundredyear anniversary video and the novel  intruder in  brazilian pop star ana volans rerecorded echoes of november her rendition sold briskly in brazil the cds jacket contains a dedication to dick allen and his hall of fame candidacy hall of fame candidacyedit nearly forty years after retiring allen remains a much discussed and still controversial ballplayer an increasing number of baseball historians regard him as the best player not inducted into the baseball hall of fame allen appeared on the hall of fames  golden era committee ballot the committee votes every three years since  when ron santo was elected by the committee of  selected candidates selected by a committee of the baseball writers association of america from the  to  era for consideration of hall of fame enshrinement in  allen and tony oliva were both one vote short of the required  votes by the committee which elected none of the candidates sabermetrician bill james rated dick allen as the secondmost controversial player in baseball history behind rogers hornsby james called allens autobiography crash one of the best baseball books in recent years for many years allen held the distinction of the highest slugging percentage among players eligible for but not in the national baseball hall of fame this only ended in  when albert belle became eligible but was not elected allen barra wrote in his wall street journal sports column that a growing body of baseball historians think that dick allen is the best player eligible for the hall of fame  the arguments usually center around his very high career averages batting  slugging  and onbase  they also point out that he began his career during the mids a period so dominated by pitchers that it is sometimes called the second dead ball era  of the major league batters with  or more career home runs whose play intersected dick allens career at the beginning or end only mickey mantles lifetime ops of  topped dick allens lifetime  ops  his career ops is the second highest of any retired player not in the hall of fame only topped by mark mcgwire allen also played some of his career in pitcherfriendly parks such as busch memorial stadium dodger stadium and comiskey park in addition to hitting for high offensive percentages allen displayed prodigious power before scientific weight training musclebuilding dietary supplements and anabolic steroids allen boasted a powerful and muscular physique along the lines of mickey mantle and jimmie foxx indeed baseball historian bill jenkinson ranks allen with foxx and mantle and just a notch below babe ruth as the four top longdistance sluggers ever to wield a baseball bat a segment of mlb networks prime  concurred with jenkinsons findings on that same broadcast willie mays stated that allen hit a ball harder than any player he had ever seen dick allen like babe ruth hit with a rather heavy bat allens ouncer bucked the ted williamsinspired trend of using a light bat for increased bat speed allen combined massive strength and body torque to produce bat speed and drive the ball two of his drives cleared connie mack stadiums foothigh left field grandstand twice allen cleared that parks foothigh right center field scoreboard a feat considered virtually impossible for a righthanded hitter detractors of allens hall of fame credentials argue that his career was not as long as most hall of famers so he does not have the career cumulative numbers that others do they further argue that the controversies surrounding him negatively impacted his teams hall of fame player willie stargell countered with a historical perspective of dick allens time dick allen played the game in the most conservative era in baseball history it was a time of change and protest in the country and baseball reacted against all that they saw it as a threat to the game the sportswriters were reactionary too they didnt like seeing a man of such extraordinary skills doing it his way it made them nervous dick allen was ahead of his time his views and way of doing things would go unnoticed today if i had been manager of the phillies back when he was playing i would have found a way to make dick allen comfortable i would have told him to blow off the writers it was my observation that when dick allen was comfortable balls left the park the two managers for whom allen played the longest—gene mauch of the phillies and chuck tanner of the white sox—agreed with willie stargell that allen was not a clubhouse lawyer who harmed team chemistry asked if allens behavior ever had a negative influence on the team mauch said never dicks teammates always liked him id take him in a minute according to tanner dick was the leader of our team the captain the manager on the field he took care of the young kids took them under his wing and he played every game as if it was his last day on earth hall of fame player orlando cepeda agreed saying to author tim whitaker dick allen played with fire in his eyes  hall of fame teammate rich gossage also confirmed tanners view in an interview with usa today sports gossage said ive been around the game a long time and hes the greatest player ive ever seen play in my life he had the most amazing season  ive ever seen hes the smartest baseball man ive ever been around in my life he taught me how to pitch from a hitters prospective and taught me how to play the game right theres no telling the numbers this guy could have put up if all he worried about was stats the guy belongs in the hall of fame  another of allens exwhite sox teammates pitcher stan bahnsen said i actually thought that dick was better than his stats every time we needed a clutch hit he got it he got along great with his teammates and he was very knowledgeable about the game he was the ultimate team guy another hall of fame teammate mike schmidt credited dick allen in his book clearing the bases as his mentor in schmidts biography written by historian william c kashatus schmidt fondly recalls allen mentoring him before a game in chicago in  saying to him mike youve got to relax youve got to have some fun remember when you were just a kid and youd skip supper to play ball you were having fun hey with all the talent youve got baseball ought to be fun enjoy it be a kid again schmidt responded by hitting four home runs in that game mike schmidt is quoted in the same book the baseball writers used to claim that dick would divide the clubhouse along racial lines that was a lie the truth is that dick never divided any clubhouse see

baltimore orioles from  to  under jack dunn the discoverer of babe ruth and later pitched against ruth in the american league ogden stated in a philadelphia bulletin story printed on july   that dick allen was the only player he ever saw who hit a ball as hard as babe ruth allens playing career got off to a turbulent start as he faced racial harassment while playing for the phillies minor league

richie all the time when he hits a home run theres no souvenir while playing for philadelphia allen appeared on several allstar teams including the – teams in the latter of these three games he hit a home run off dean chance he led the league in slugging  ops  and extra base hits  in  nonbaseball incidents soon marred allens philadelphia career in july  he got into a fistfight with fellow phillie frank thomas according to two teammates who witnessed the fight thomas swung a bat at allen hitting him in the shoulder johnny callison said thomas got himself fired when he swung that bat at richie in baseball you dont swing a bat at another player—ever pat corrales confirmed that thomas hit allen with a bat and added that thomas was a bully known for making racially divisive remarks allen and his teammates were not permitted to give their side of the story under threat of a heavy fine the phillies released thomas the next day that not only made the fans and local sports writers see allen as costing a white player his job but freed thomas to give his version of the fight in an hourlong interview aired december   on the mlb networks studio  with bob costas allen asserted that he and thomas are in fact good friends now allens name was a source of controversy he had been known since his youth as dick to family and friends but for reasons which are still somewhat obscure the media referred to him upon his arrival in philadelphia as richie possibly a conflation with the longtime phillies star richie ashburncitation needed after leaving the phillies he asked to be called dick saying richie was a little boys name in his dual career as an rb singer the label on his records with the groovy grooves firm slated him as rich allen some of the phillies own fans known for being tough on hometown players even in the best of times exacerbated allens problems initially the abuse was verbal with obscenities and racial epithets eventually allen was greeted with showers of fruit ice refuse and even flashlight batteries as he took the field he began wearing his batting helmet even while playing his position in the field which gave rise to another nickname crash helmet shortened to crashcitation needed he almost ended his career in  after mangling his throwing hand by pushing it through a car headlight allen was fined  and suspended indefinitely in  when he failed to appear for the phillies twinight doubleheader game with the new york mets allen had gone to new jersey in the morning to see a horse race and got caught in traffic trying to return he was reinstated but wanted to be traded due to problems in having a trade made right then he agreed to finish the  season with the philliescitation needed st louis cardinals and los angeles dodgersedit allen finally had enough and demanded the phillies trade him they sent him to the cardinals in a trade before the  season even this deal caused controversy though not of allens making since cardinals outfielder curt flood refused to report to the phillies as part of the trade flood then sued baseball in an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the reserve clause and to be declared a free agent coincidentally the player the phillies received as compensation for flood not reporting willie montañez hit  home runs as a  rookie to eclipse dick allens phillies rookie home run record of  set in  allen earned another allstar berth in st louis and his personal problems seemed to abate the cardinals even acceded to his wishes regarding his name as cardinals broadcaster jack buck made a point from game one of calling him dick allen decades before mark mcgwire dick allen entertained the st louis fans with some long home runs at least one of them landing in the seats above the club level in left field as jack buck said at the time some of the folks in the stadium club might have choked on a chicken leg when they saw that one comingcitation needed nevertheless the cardinals traded allen to the los angeles dodgers before the  season for  nl rookie of the year ted sizemore and catcher bob stinson the la dodgers  first round draft pick allen had a relatively quiet season in  although he hit  for the dodgers chicago white soxedit the dodgers traded allen to the white sox for pitcher tommy john prior to the  season for various reasons allens previous managers had shuffled him around on defense playing him at first base third base and the outfield in no particular order—a practice which almost certainly weakened his defensive play and which may have contributed to his frequent injuries not to mention his perceived bad attitude sox manager chuck tanners lowkey style of handling ballplayers made it possible for allen to thrive for a while on the south side he decided to play allen exclusively at first base which allowed him to concentrate on hitting that first year his first in the american league allen almost singlehandedly lifted the entire team to second place in the

agreed that allens clout wouldve easily surpassed  ft  m on the fly the sox were favored by many to make the playoffs in  but those hopes were dashed due in large measure to the fractured fibula that

unpredictable thing happened they cheered rich allen they cheered him as warmly as they have ever cheered him for a gamewinning home run although his music career was not as substantial or longlasting

allen and his hall of fame candidacy hall of fame candidacyedit nearly forty years after retiring allen remains a much discussed and still controversial ballplayer an increasing number of baseball historians regard him as the best player not inducted into the baseball hall of fame allen appeared on the hall of fames  golden era committee ballot the committee votes every three years since  when ron santo was elected by the committee of  selected candidates selected by a committee of the baseball writers association of america from the  to  era for consideration of hall of fame enshrinement in  allen and tony oliva were both one vote short of the required  votes by the committee which elected none of the candidates sabermetrician bill james rated dick allen as the secondmost controversial player in baseball history behind rogers hornsby james called allens autobiography crash one of the best baseball books in recent years for many years allen held the distinction of the highest slugging percentage among players eligible for but not in the national baseball hall of fame this only ended in  when albert belle became eligible but was not elected allen barra wrote in his wall street journal sports column that a growing body of baseball historians think that dick allen is the best player eligible for the hall of fame  the arguments usually center around his very high career averages batting  slugging  and onbase  they also point out that he began his career during the mids a period so dominated by pitchers that it is sometimes called the second dead ball era  of the major league batters with  or more career home runs whose play intersected dick allens career at the beginning or end only mickey mantles lifetime ops of  topped dick allens lifetime  ops  his career ops is the second highest of any retired player not in the hall of fame only topped by mark mcgwire allen also played some of his career in pitcherfriendly parks such as busch memorial stadium dodger stadium and comiskey park in addition to hitting for high offensive percentages allen displayed prodigious power before scientific weight training musclebuilding dietary supplements and anabolic steroids allen boasted a powerful and muscular physique along the lines of mickey mantle and jimmie foxx indeed baseball historian bill jenkinson ranks allen with foxx and mantle and just a notch below babe ruth as the four top longdistance sluggers ever to wield a baseball bat a segment of mlb networks prime  concurred with jenkinsons findings on that same broadcast willie mays stated that allen hit a ball harder than any player he had ever seen dick allen like babe ruth hit with a rather heavy bat allens ouncer bucked the ted williamsinspired trend of using a light bat for increased bat speed allen combined massive strength and body torque to produce bat speed and drive the ball two of his drives cleared connie mack stadiums foothigh left field grandstand twice allen cleared that parks foothigh right center field scoreboard a feat considered virtually impossible for a righthanded hitter detractors of allens hall of fame credentials argue that his career was not as long as most hall of famers so he does not have the career cumulative numbers that others do they further argue that the controversies surrounding him negatively impacted his teams hall of fame player willie stargell countered with a historical perspective of dick allens time dick allen played the game in the most conservative era in baseball history it was a time of change and protest in the country and baseball reacted against all that they saw it as a threat to the game the sportswriters were reactionary too they didnt like seeing a man of such extraordinary skills doing it his way it made them nervous dick allen was ahead of his time his views and way of doing things would go unnoticed today if i had been manager of the phillies back when he was playing i would have found a way to make dick allen comfortable i would have told him to blow off the writers it was my observation that when dick allen was comfortable balls left the park the two managers for whom allen played the longest—gene mauch of the phillies and chuck tanner of the white sox—agreed with willie stargell that allen was not a clubhouse lawyer who harmed team chemistry asked if allens behavior ever had a negative influence on the team mauch said never dicks teammates always liked him id take him in a minute according to tanner dick was the leader of our team the captain the manager on the field he took care of the young kids took them under his wing and he played every game as if it was his last day on earth hall of fame player orlando cepeda agreed saying to author tim whitaker dick allen played with fire in his eyes  hall of fame teammate rich gossage also confirmed tanners view in an interview with usa today sports gossage said ive been around the game a long time and hes the greatest player ive ever seen play in my life he had the most amazing season  ive ever seen hes the smartest baseball man ive ever been around in my life he taught me how to pitch from a hitters prospective and taught me how to play the game right theres no telling the numbers this guy could have put up if all he worried about was stats the guy belongs in the hall of fame  another of allens exwhite sox teammates pitcher stan bahnsen said i actually thought that dick was better than his stats every time we needed a clutch hit he got it he got along great with his teammates and he was very knowledgeable about the game he was the ultimate team guy another hall of fame teammate mike schmidt credited dick allen in his book clearing the bases as his mentor in schmidts biography written by historian william c kashatus schmidt fondly recalls allen mentoring him before a game in chicago in  saying to him mike youve got to relax youve got to have some fun remember when you were just a kid and youd skip supper to play ball you were having fun hey with all the talent youve got baseball ought to be fun enjoy it be a kid again schmidt responded by hitting four home runs in that game mike schmidt is quoted in the same book the baseball writers used to claim that dick would divide the clubhouse along racial lines that was a lie the truth is that dick never divided any clubhouse see

philadelphia fans had not seen since chuck klein and jimmie foxx phillies scout john ogden convinced the phillies to sign allen in  for a  bonus john ogden played for the international league baltimore orioles from  to  under jack dunn the discoverer of babe ruth and later pitched against ruth in the american league ogden stated in a philadelphia bulletin story printed on july   that dick allen was the only player he ever saw who hit a ball as hard as babe ruth allens playing career got off to a turbulent start as he faced racial harassment while playing for the phillies minor league affiliate in little rock residents staged protest parades against allen the local teams first black player nevertheless he led the league in total bases his first season in the majors  ranks among the greatest rookie seasons ever he led the league in runs  triples  extra base hits  and total bases  he finished in the top five in batting average  slugging average  hits  and doubles  and won rookie

first game of the streak to the cincinnati reds when chico ruiz stole home with frank robinson batting for the games only run in allens autobiography written with tim whitaker crash the life and times

ray washburn in  which he cleared connie mack stadiums left center field roof coke sign that home run an estimated footer inspired willie stargell to say now i know why they the phillies fans boo richie all the time when he hits a home run theres no souvenir while playing for philadelphia allen appeared on several allstar teams including the – teams in the latter of these three games he hit a home run off dean chance he led the league in slugging  ops  and extra base hits  in  nonbaseball incidents soon marred allens philadelphia career in july  he got into a fistfight with fellow phillie frank thomas according to two teammates who witnessed the fight thomas swung a bat at allen hitting him in the shoulder johnny callison said thomas got himself fired when he swung that bat at richie in baseball you dont swing a bat at another player—ever pat corrales confirmed that thomas hit allen with a bat and added that thomas was a bully known for making racially divisive remarks allen and his teammates were not permitted to give their side of the story under threat of a heavy fine the phillies released thomas the next day that not only made the fans and local sports writers see allen as costing a white player his job but freed thomas to give his version of the fight in an hourlong interview aired december   on the mlb networks studio  with bob costas allen asserted that he and thomas are in fact good friends now allens name was a source of controversy he had been known since his youth as dick to family and friends but for reasons which are still somewhat obscure the media referred to him upon his arrival in philadelphia as richie possibly a conflation with the longtime phillies star richie ashburncitation needed after leaving the phillies he asked to be called dick saying richie was a little boys name in his dual career as an rb singer the label on his records with the groovy grooves firm slated him as rich allen some of the phillies own fans known for being tough on hometown players even in the best of times exacerbated allens problems initially the abuse was verbal with obscenities and racial epithets eventually allen was greeted with showers of fruit ice refuse and even flashlight batteries as he took the field he began wearing his batting helmet even while playing his position in the field which gave rise to another nickname crash helmet shortened to crashcitation needed he almost ended his career in  after mangling his throwing hand by pushing it through a car headlight allen was fined  and suspended indefinitely in  when he failed to appear for the phillies twinight doubleheader game with the new york mets allen had gone to new jersey in the morning to see a horse race and got caught in traffic trying to return he was reinstated but wanted to be traded due to problems in having a trade made right then he agreed to finish the  season with the philliescitation needed st louis cardinals and los angeles dodgersedit allen finally had enough and demanded the phillies trade him they sent him to the cardinals in a trade before the  season even this deal caused controversy though not of allens making since cardinals outfielder curt flood refused to report to the phillies as part of the trade flood then sued baseball in an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the reserve clause and to be declared a free agent coincidentally the player the phillies received as compensation for flood not reporting willie montañez hit  home runs as a  rookie to eclipse dick allens phillies rookie home run record of  set in  allen earned another allstar berth in st louis and his personal problems seemed to abate the cardinals even acceded to his wishes regarding his name as cardinals broadcaster jack buck made a point from game one of calling him dick allen decades before mark mcgwire dick allen entertained the st louis fans with some long home runs at least one of them landing in the seats above the club level in left field as jack buck said at the time some of the folks in the stadium club might have choked on a chicken leg when they saw that one comingcitation needed nevertheless the cardinals traded allen to the los angeles dodgers before the  season for  nl rookie of the year ted sizemore and catcher bob stinson the la dodgers  first round draft pick allen had a relatively quiet season in  although he hit  for the dodgers chicago white soxedit the dodgers traded allen to the white sox for pitcher tommy john prior to the  season for various reasons allens previous managers had shuffled him around on defense playing him at first base third base and the outfield in no particular order—a practice which almost certainly weakened his defensive play and which may have contributed to his frequent injuries not to mention his perceived bad attitude sox manager chuck tanners lowkey style of handling ballplayers made it possible for allen to thrive for a while on the south side he decided to play allen exclusively at first base which allowed him to concentrate on hitting that first year his first in the american league allen almost singlehandedly lifted the entire team to second place in the

who credit him with saving the franchise for chicago it was rumored to be bound for st petersburg or seattle at the time his powerful swing sent home runs deep into some of cavernous old comiskey parks farthest reaches including the roof and even the distant  ft center field bleachers a rare feat at one of baseballs most pitcherfriendly stadiums on july   allen became the first player in baseballs modern era to hit two insidethepark home runs in one game both homers were hit off bert blyleven in the white sox  victory over the minnesota twins at metropolitan stadium on july   at detroits tiger stadium he lined a homer off the roof facade in deep leftcenter field at a linear distance of approximately  feet  m and an altitude of  feet  m anecdotal and mathematical evidence agreed that allens clout wouldve easily surpassed  ft  m on the fly the sox were favored by many to make the playoffs in  but those hopes were dashed due in large measure to the fractured fibula that allen suffered in june he tried to return five weeks after injuring the leg in a collision with mike epstein of the as but the pain ended his season after just one game in which he batted for in  despite his making the al allstar team in each of the three years with the sox allens stay in chicago ended in controversy when he left the team on september  with two weeks left in the season in his autobiography allen blamed his feud with thirdbaseman ron santo who was playing a final undistinguished season with the white sox after leaving the crosstown chicago cubs with allens intention to continue playing baseball uncertain the white sox reluctantly sold his contract to the atlanta braves for only  despite the fact that he had led the league in home runs slugging  and ops  allen refused to report to the braves and announced his retirement return to the philliesedit the phillies managed to coax allen out of retirement for the  season the layoff and nagging effects of his  broken leg hampered his play his numbers improved in  a phillies division winner as he hit  home runs and batted  in  games he continued his tape measure legacy during his second goround with the

dodger stadium and comiskey park in addition to hitting for high offensive percentages allen displayed prodigious power before scientific weight training musclebuilding dietary supplements and anabolic steroids allen boasted a powerful and muscular physique along the lines of mickey mantle and jimmie foxx indeed baseball historian bill jenkinson ranks allen with foxx and mantle and just a notch below babe ruth as the four top longdistance sluggers ever to wield a baseball bat a segment of mlb networks prime  concurred with jenkinsons findings on that same broadcast willie mays stated that allen hit a ball harder than any player he had ever seen dick allen like babe ruth hit with a rather heavy bat allens ouncer bucked the ted williamsinspired trend of using a light bat for increased bat speed allen combined massive strength and body torque to produce bat speed and drive the ball two of his drives cleared connie mack stadiums foothigh left field grandstand twice allen cleared that parks foothigh right center field scoreboard a feat considered virtually impossible for a righthanded hitter detractors of allens hall of fame credentials argue that his career was not as long as most hall of famers so he does not have the career cumulative numbers that others do they further argue that the controversies surrounding him negatively impacted his teams hall of fame player willie stargell countered with a historical perspective of dick allens time dick allen played the game in the most conservative era in baseball history it was a time of change and protest in the country and baseball reacted against all that they saw it as a threat to the game the sportswriters were reactionary too they didnt like seeing a man of such extraordinary skills doing it his way it made them nervous dick allen was ahead of his time his views and way of doing things would go unnoticed today if i had been manager of the phillies back when he was playing i would have found a way to make dick allen comfortable i would have told him to blow off the writers it was my observation that when dick allen was comfortable balls left the park the two managers for whom allen played the longest—gene mauch of the phillies and chuck tanner of the white sox—agreed with willie stargell that allen was not a clubhouse lawyer who harmed team chemistry asked if allens behavior ever had a negative influence on the team mauch said never dicks teammates always liked him id take him in a minute according to tanner dick was the leader of our team the captain the manager on the field he took care of the young kids took them under his wing and he played every game as if it was his last day on earth hall of fame player orlando cepeda agreed saying to author tim whitaker dick allen played with fire in his eyes  hall of fame teammate rich gossage also confirmed tanners view in an interview with usa today sports gossage said ive been around the game a long time and hes the greatest player ive ever seen play in my life he had the most amazing season  ive ever seen hes the smartest baseball man ive ever been around in my life he taught me how to pitch from a hitters prospective and taught me how to play the game right theres no telling the numbers this guy could have put up if all he worried about was stats the guy belongs in the hall of fame  another of allens exwhite sox teammates pitcher stan bahnsen said i actually thought that dick was better than his stats every time we needed a clutch hit he got it he got along great with his teammates and he was very knowledgeable about the game he was the ultimate team guy another hall of fame teammate mike schmidt credited dick allen in his book clearing the bases as his mentor in schmidts biography written by historian william c kashatus schmidt fondly recalls allen mentoring him before a game in chicago in  saying to him mike youve got to relax youve got to have some fun remember when you were just a kid and youd skip supper to play ball you were having fun hey with all the talent youve got baseball ought to be fun enjoy it be a kid again schmidt responded by hitting four home runs in that game mike schmidt is quoted in the same book the baseball writers used to claim that dick would divide the clubhouse along racial lines that was a lie the truth is that dick never divided any clubhouse see
