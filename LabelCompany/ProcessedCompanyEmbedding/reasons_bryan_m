reasons why by thegrok home about us bryan eisenberg jeffrey eisenberg publications speaking coaching archives contact us twitter rss linkedin facebook email bryan  jeffrey eisenbergprofessional speakers best selling authors online marketing pioneersoctober   by bryan eisenberg  comments what makes people buy  reasons why our mentor roy williams described shoppers as operating in either one of two modes transactional or relational a few years ago at that time some of us loafed around virtually exchanging emails with friends trying to complete a list of reasons that motivate people to buy things thank you tom g  brett f more recently we returned to compiling the list with the rest of my colleagues trying to understand these types of things is what drives us it also benefits our clients what follows below is what we came up with albeit likely incomplete as you read this list can you identify which of these motivations is relational and which are transactional can you see where they each fit within maslow’s hierarchy of needs define will you help us find additional motivations some of these are selfexplanatory the forces that influence whether people buy include basic needs – we buy things to fulfill what maslow describes as the bottom of his hierarchy things like food and shelter convenience – you need something now and will take the easiest or fastest path to get it think about the last time you were running out of gas or were thirsty and found the nearest beverage of choice this could also be choosing the safe vendor no one ever gets fired for hiring ibm purchasing something to increase comfort or efficiency replacement – sometimes you buy because you need to replace old things you have eg clothes that don’t fit or are outofdate this could be moving from a vcr to a dvd player scarcity – this could be around collectibles or a perceived need that something may run out or have limited availability in the future additionally there’s a hope to gain a return on investment such as collectible or antiques anything that accrues value over time prestige or aspirational purchase – something is purchased for an esteemrelated reason or for personal enrichment emotional vacuum – sometimes you just buy to try to replace things you cannot have and never will lower prices – something you identified earlier as a want is now a lower price than before maybe you were browsing for a particular large screen tv and you saw a great summer special great value – when the perceived value substantially exceeds the price of a product or service this is something you don’t particularly need you just feel it’s too good a deal to pass up like the stuff they place near the end caps or checkout counters of stores name recognition – when purchasing a category you’re unfamiliar with branding plays a big role maybe you had to buy diapers for a family member and you reach for pampers because of you’re familiarity with the brand even though you don’t have children yourself fad or innovation – everybody wants the latest and greatest iphone mania this could also be when someone mimics their favorite celebrity compulsory purchase – some external force like school books uniforms or something your boss asked you to do makes it mandatory this often happens in emergencies such as when you need a plumber ego stroking – sometimes you make a purchase to impressattract the opposite sex to have something biggerbetter than others friends etc to look like an expertaficionado to meet a standard of social status often exceeding what’s realistically affordable to make it at least seem like you operate at a higher level niche identity – something that helps bond you to a cultural religious or community affiliation maybe you’re a harvard alumni and yankee fan who keeps kosher you can also find antiniche identity by rebellion assuming you’re pretty comfortable with irony peer pressure – something is purchased because your friends want you to you may need to think back to your teen years to think of an example the “girl scout cookie effect” – people feel better about themselves by feeling as though they’re giving to others almost especially when they’re promised something in return purchasing things they don’t need–or wouldn’t normally purchase–because it will help another person or make the world a better place incrementally is essential certain buying decision reciprocity or guilt – this happens when somebody–usually an acquaintance or someone rarely giftworthy–buys you a gift or does something exceptionally nice andor unnecessary now it’s your turn to return the favor at the next opportunity examples event – when the social decorum of an event eg wedding bar mitzvah etc dictates buying something or another holiday – ‘nuff said empathy – sometimes people buy from other people because they listened and cared about them even if they had the lesser value alternative addiction – this is outside the range of the normal human operating system but it certainly exists and accounts for more sales than any of us can fathom can you think back to the last time you bought something and fully explain the reason why fear – from pink taser™ stun guns to oversized suv’s to backyard bomb shelters–and even stuff so basic as a tire pressure gauge–are bought out of fear so before you go knocking “fear” as a motivator ask yourself are you yk compliant indulgence – who doesn’t deserve a bit of luxury now and then so long as you can afford it sometimes there’s no better justification for that hourlong massage that pint of cherry garcia ice cream or that  bottle of year single malt scotch other than “you’re worth it” best when said to self in front of mirror with a wink andor head tilt these are the things we’ve helped clients think about we hope this list at least gets you started and let us know if you need help understanding your customers motivations it’s what we do but in the meantime… what do you feel
