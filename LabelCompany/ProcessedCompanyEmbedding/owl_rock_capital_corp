company a maryland corporation is organized as a closedend management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a bdc under section a of the act applicants state that the company seeks to generate current income and to a lesser extent capital appreciation by targeting investment opportunities with favorable risk adjusted returns  bdc ii a maryland corporation was organized on october   for the purpose of operating as an externally managed closedend management investment company which will elect to be regulated as a bdc under section a of the act applicants state that bdc ii seeks to

investment adviser to bdc ii  applicants seek an order “order” to permit one or more regulated funds  andor one or more affiliated funds  to participate in the same investment opportunities through a proposed coinvestment program the “coinvestment program” where such participation would otherwise be prohibited under section a and rule d by a coinvesting with each other in securities issued by issuers in private placement transactions in which an adviser negotiates terms in addition to price  and b making additional investments in securities of such issuers including through the exercise of warrants conversion privileges and other rights to purchase securities of the issuers “followon investments” “coinvestment transaction” means any transaction in which a regulated fund or its whollyowned investment sub as defined below participated together with one or more other regulated funds andor one or more affiliated funds in reliance on the requested order “potential coinvestment transaction” means any investment opportunity in which a regulated fund or its whollyowned investment sub could not participate together with one or more affiliated funds andor one or more other regulated funds without obtaining and relying on the order  applicants state any of the regulated funds may from time to time form one or more whollyowned investment subs a whollyowned investment sub would be prohibited from investing in a coinvestment transaction with any affiliated fund or regulated fund because it would be a company controlled by its parent regulated fund for purposes of section a and rule d applicants request that each whollyowned investment sub be permitted to participate in coinvestment transactions in lieu of its parent regulated fund and that the whollyowned investment subs participation in any such transaction be treated for start printed page purposes of the requested order as though the parent regulated fund were participating directly applicants represent that this treatment is justified because a whollyowned investment sub would have no purpose other than serving as a holding vehicle for the regulated funds investments and therefore no conflicts of interest could arise between the regulated fund and the whollyowned investment sub the regulated funds board would make all relevant determinations under the conditions with regard to a whollyowned investment subs participation in a coinvestment transaction and the regulated funds board would be informed of and take into consideration any proposed use of a whollyowned investment sub in the regulated funds place if the regulated fund proposes to participate in the same coinvestment transaction with any of its whollyowned investment subs the board will also be informed of and take into consideration the relative participation of the regulated fund and the whollyowned investment sub  when considering potential coinvestment transactions for any regulated fund the applicable adviser will consider only the objectives and strategies investment policies investment positions capital available for investment as described in the application “available capital” and other pertinent factors applicable to that regulated fund the board of each regulated fund including the directors that are not “interested persons” within the meaning of section a of the act the “noninterested directors” has or will have prior to relying on the requested order determined that it is in the best interests of the regulated fund to participate in coinvestment transactions  other than pro rata dispositions and followon investments as provided in conditions  and  and after making the determinations required in conditions  and a the adviser will present each potential coinvestment transaction and the proposed allocation to the directors of the board eligible to vote under section o of the act “eligible directors” and the “required majority” as defined in section o of the act “required majority”  will approve each coinvestment transaction prior to any investment by the participating regulated fund  with respect to the pro rata dispositions and followon investments provided in conditions  and  a regulated fund may participate in a pro rata disposition or followon investment without obtaining prior approval of the required majority if among other things i the proposed participation of each regulated fund and affiliated fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition or followon investment as the case may be and ii the board of the regulated fund has approved that regulated funds participation in pro rata dispositions and followon investments as being in the best interests of the regulated fund if the board does not so approve any such disposition or followon investment will be submitted to the regulated funds eligible directors the board of any regulated fund may at any time rescind suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata dispositions and followon investments with the result that all dispositions andor followon investments must be submitted to the eligible directors  no noninterested director of a regulated fund will have a financial interest in any coinvestment transaction other than through share ownership in one of the regulated funds  if an adviser or its principal owners the “principals” or any person controlling controlled by or under common control with an adviser or the principals and the affiliated funds collectively the “holders” own in the aggregate more than  percent of the outstanding voting shares of a regulated fund the “shares” then the holders will vote such shares as required under condition  applicants believe that this condition will ensure that the noninterested directors will act independently in evaluating the coinvestment program because the ability of an adviser or the principals to influence the noninterested directors by a suggestion explicit or implied that the noninterested directors can be removed if desired by the holders will be limited significantly the noninterested directors will evaluate and approve any such independent party taking into account its qualifications reputation for independence cost to the shareholders and other factors that they deem relevant applicants legal analysis  section a of the act prohibits certain affiliated persons of a bdc from participating in joint transactions with the bdc or a company controlled by a bdc in contravention of rules as prescribed by the commission under section b of the act any person who is directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with a bdc is subject to section a applicants submit that each of the regulated funds and affiliated funds could be deemed to be a person related to each regulated fund in a manner described by section b by virtue of being under common control section i of the act provides that until the commission prescribes rules under section a the commissions rules under section d of the act applicable to registered closedend investment companies will be deemed to apply to transactions subject to section a because the commission has not adopted any rules under section a rule d also applies to joint transactions with regulated funds that are bdcs section d of

registered investment company from participating in joint transactions with the company unless the commission has granted an order permitting such transactions in passing upon applications under rule d the commission considers whether the companys participation in the joint transaction is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants  applicants state that in the absence of the requested relief the regulated funds would be in some circumstances limited in their ability to participate in attractive and appropriate investment opportunities applicants believe that the proposed terms and conditions will ensure that the coinvestment transactions are consistent with the protection of each regulated funds shareholders and with the purposes intended by the policies and provisions of the act applicants state that the regulated funds participation in the coinvestment transactions will be consistent with the provisions start printed page policies and purposes of the act and on a basis that is not different from or less advantageous than that of
