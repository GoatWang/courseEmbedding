and then  looking for a few more in  🚀💸dec  product partnerships pt — the making of a partnershipi realized the other day that i’ve spent a lot of the last few years building products in partnership with other companies i’ve led teams that shipped products with stripe hubspot paypal amazon bmo wepay and elance and am currently working on a few moreproduct partnerships bring unique challenges to companies and to the teams executing them products built internally are already tough to get right but products built in partnership are doubly so if your team is about to embark on one get ready to stretchthe reasons are simple when you build internally you can build what you want and when users give feedback you can freely iterate when you build in partnership what you build is subject to your partner and when users give feedback your ability to iterate is hamstrung by the partner’s technical dependencies capabilities and differing prioritiesas a pm executing product partnerships your stakeholder universe will double and the complexity of execution squares you now have to consider two sets of users two company visions and two product teams in every decision you make with obvious preference for your ownin part  of this post we’ll take a high level look at product partnerships why companies partner how they form building alignment and the politics of partnershipin part  we’ll dive deeper into how a pm should execute on a product partnershipwhy companies partnerone word accelerationgood partnerships arise because they create short cuts for both companies to achieve their goals it’s close to the classic “winwin” except that product partnerships need a third win for the customersthe strategic intent for most partnerships fall into two broad categories where a company wants to eitherexpand their product into areas that are outside of their core competencies because those areas are still integral parts of their customers’ workflowstap into distribution from the partner’s customer base because of its sheer size or because the partner’s customers are a great fit with the company’s productmost partnerships will fall into a x matrix with the above goals on the axes here’s a look at that matrix and a few examplesstripe and lyftstripe powers lyft’s payments stripe gets distribution lyft gets payment utility outside of it’s core competency in the long term lyft could build its own payment processing and capture more margin but stripe defends against that by providing even more utilityspotify  uberspotify users can listen to their music when they take any uber this is a great example of trading distribution through a great use case almost universally people like to control the music when they drive so spotify becomes the music platform for choice for uber’s millions of users and uber becomes the ride service of choice for spotify’s millionsfreshbooks  hubspotafter closing a client deal using hubspot users can easily invoice their client in freshbooks both companies make their product more valuable for the endtoend workflow of it’s users without having to leave their core competenciesibm  appleapple kicked off its enterprise mobility program by partnering with ibm to build hundreds of industry specific mobile apps this is a case of a partnership that drives both distribution and product expansion it’s out of apple’s core competency to make good apps for enterprise and they don’t have the distribution into the enterprise that ibm represents ibm has the domain expertise to make good apps but doesn’t have the mobile platform to distribute itregardless of whether the emphasis for the partnership is product expansion or distribution partnerships that last have one thing in common they deliver customer utility marketing ‘partnerships’ on the other hand where companies essentially trade customers and crosssell products are short term and tactical at best and aren’t what this post focuses onnow we know what types of partnerships tend to succeed how exactly do they formwhere partnerships are bornideas are cheap and because of that there are a lot of partnership opportunities out there it’s quite easy to imagine a fruitful partnership between almost any two companies with such abundant choice which ones make it to launchin my experience partnership formation is more opportunistic right place right time rather than strategic to illustrate this in no particular order here’s a quick list of things i’ve been a part ofyour exec meets their exec at some event they hit it off start pontificating about the future see a shared vision or culture and declare “we should do something together have your team reach out to mine”their biz dev bd person sends an inbound request to discuss and viceversa and it so happens the other side currently has the bandwidth to talkan employees leaves from one company to the other on good terms and uses their former network to seed a partnership from the insideas a precursor to an acquisition where the incumbent ‘partner’ is actually doing a stealth interview and it evolves into just a partnership in the endvcs broker deals with each other on behalf their portfolio companiescompany a independently builds app on company b’s platform and there is traction company b notices it and wants to integrate more tightlyas you can see partnership formation is chaotic and heavily relationship driven as most things arei often wondered why has this been the case why such an organic mechanism instead of intense planning and strategic partnership maps from mba textbooks after all product partnerships can be huge commitments of resourcesi think an analogy lies in the world of dating before dating apps existed back then even if you knew the qualities of the date you were looking for finding someone was really hard you could go to the bar every night but your chances of finding someone that fit those qualities liked you back and was ready to date was low it wasn’t surprising then that most relationships came from introductions from friends and family who would ‘backchannel’ the needs of both sides and then match makelikewise partnership formation tends to be organic because finding a partner with the right qualities who wants to partner with you and is ready to partner is low probabilitypartner dating might be tough but marriage is harder now that you’ve found your partner through some serendipitous experience what’s nextbuilding partnership alignmentall good partnerships are built on strong continuous alignment between companies alignment means knowing what each side expects from the other how important the partnership is to the other’s strategy which teams will be working on it and when they can startafter a partner has expressed interest in working together book that first meeting in person if possible with the sole focus of driving alignment here are some questions you can ask to drive itlearn about each other to get the right contexthow did company get to where you are todaywhat is your culture likewhat is your vision and how has it changed over timewhat are your top strategic goals for the next – monthsget very clear on what success looks likeliterally what does success look like to youdescribe a successful phase one productwhat metrics would you be looking forwhat impact does this need to make to be interesting to youfor those inside company that don’t believe in this partnership what is their rationalewhere could the partnership go if phase  is successfulgauge their urgencywhen are you hoping we can launchwe’d love to get started next week optional is there a team already ready to work with usawesomeconference is in june should we try to colaunch at that eventdriving alignment will require more than a single conversation with the partner pm or biz dev person you need to drive it at many levels the teams executive stakeholders and lawyers on both sides all need to reach a consensus and he earlier you do this the better aligning early ensures a healthy relationship that will prevent blockers and even partnership deaths down the line it can also raise the red flags early preventing a partnership that would have otherwise wasted resourcespartnership politics — big fish small fishpower dynamics are very real in the partnership world  times out of  there is a clear big fish and a clear small one and it’s imperative that you recognize which one you arethe small fish is friendlier icons co freepikthe principle dynamic to be aware of is who has more to gain relative to the scale of their company find this and you find where the leverage is typically the small fish has much more to gain and therefore the big fish has most of the leveragehow to act when you’re the big or small fish is highly situational but in my experience from being on both sides there are certain guidelinesbig fish small fish guidelinessame sized fish guidelinesthese are the partnerships with the greatest risk of failure because each side believes they’re the big fish and collaboration can take a second seat to hubris here are some things to get ready forget your negotiating hat on because both sides have equal leverageinvest x more in driving alignment on what success looks like and continually remind both sides of the benefits you’re collectively working towardsestablish a regular cadence of exec level engagement you will need high level buyin to get through the tough times and be able to keep the other side honestdon’t give away your leverage until you’ve received your benefithow to quickly ruin your partnershipwhen you’re the big fish — be a jerk because you have the leverage this is the biggest mistake you can make and i’ve seen it happen a lot you’ve basically got the other side willing to do much more than you to make something happen and you’re squandering that leverage by gambling that their emotions won’t get the best of them and make them walk away from the partnership out of spitewhen you’re the small fish — let the partnership linger go fast and push the other side to launch as soon as you’re ready they will not have the same urgency as you so you need to drivewhen you’re the same sized fish — let hubris stand in the way of compromiseyou should probably ignore all the above most of the timeif the above feels overly machiavellian your instincts are correct most of the time you should ignore these and just work in full blissful trust with your partner this is the right mindset  of the timehowever in almost every partnership i’ve worked on that  always shows up  and that’s when it’s good to be preparedthe perfect product partnershipwhen done right partnerships add a ton of value to both sides your company’s willingness to partner and ability to execute them can make a big impact on your trajectory towards achieving your visionremember that at the end of the day human relationships make partnerships work invest in

like sugar rush  customer review by theuncleanone  stars  by theuncleanone by theuncleanone first off the product is misleading there is a lot of sugar in these things  grams alone in the raw green protein  grams of sugar in sweet spin  grams in chia berry one day of cleansing takes you well over the  gram maximum for sugar they are pulpy and have terrible flavor combinations the addition of cayenne pepper to the lemonade and pomegranate mixes is terrible the aftertaste will linger for hours the cinnamon added to the raw green protein was also also a nasty combination basically the only palatable one is chia berry but at  grams of sugar you might as well order a fruit smoothie and enjoy it i didnt feel cleansed out at all i felt hungry disappointed and in need of a breath mint after every bottle was this review helpful yes  no   report thank you you have successfully submitted feedback for this review was this review helpful yes  no  theuncleanone would recommend to a friend no
