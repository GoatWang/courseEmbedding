harleydavidson th anniversary badgephoto file  connecttweet  linkedin  commentemailmoreharleydavidson loves millennials no doubt about it with much of the companys marketing aimed at motorcycle buyers ages do the millennials love harley back it looks that way as the worlds largest manufacturer of heavyweight bikes says its the market leader in sales of new onroad motorcycles to young adultsin  for the eighth straight year harley was the no  seller of new highway motorcycles in the united states to adults ages  it was also the top seller of those bikes to women africanamericans and hispanics as well as caucasian men ages plus according to motorcycle registration dataharley says its strategy to focus on growth among outreach customers lines up well with us population trendsthe millennial generation continues to grow as immigration adds to the group millennials now number  million surpassing the  million baby boomers ages  according to the pew research centerthats the challenge and the opportunity for harley and other motorcycle manufacturers that are well established with the boomers but must bridge the generation gap to the millennialsin  onethird of new harleydavidson motorcycle purchasers had never owned a bike beforewe continue to sell more harleydavidson motorcycles to todays young adults than we sold to baby boomers when they were young adults harley ceo matt levatich said saturday at the companys annual shareholders meeting held at the harleydavidson museumearning their loyalty and trust is key to our future its what has inspired us throughout our entire year history and it continues to inspire us today levatich saidmichael spaeth consumer marketing segment lead for harleydavidson pointed to harleys new  roadster and the dark custom models as examples of bikes that appeal to younger ridersalso he said in many ways millennial motorcyclists arent much different than previous generations of young ridersits almost a little eerie how much young adults riding motorcycles today look like their fathers when they were that age the young guys are wearing the same clothing as their dads and they are riding a very similar style of motorcycle spaeth saidsome have said that millennials are less likely to buy things for status image or brand loyalty theyre more likely to make a purchase based on the value for their money according to a jd power survey with more than  respondentssimplicity is inbig and shiny bikes arent as popular with millennials said kirk topel owner of hals harleydavidson in new berlinthey tend to like stuff thats more stripped down they like the simplicity of the design as opposed to how gaudy they can make something topel saidincreasingly harley dealerships are focused on attracting a younger crowd while at the same time keeping their older customerswe like to do the stuff that makes everybody feel young said chaz hastings owner of milwaukee harleydavidson a dealership that has a tattoo parlor and wednesday night dodgeball tournamentssamantha loftus  a millennial motorcyclist from milwaukee recently traded her yamaha cc bike for a  harleydavidson softail breakoutloftus said there was a time when she thought of harleys as a grandpas bike but not anymorethey have bikes that are sporty and fun i am excited about the whole experience of being a harley biker girl she saidtyler youngbeck of brown deer says he will probably trade his yamaha warrior motorcycle for a harleydavidson because the harley would be better for touringyoungbeck  has been a motorcyclist for five years one reason he wants a harley is that its a natural fit at many biker events in the area including parties at harley dealerships and the harleydavidson museumobviously riding is the best part but the social aspect is huge youngbeck said its a great atmospheremany consumerproduct companies have difficulty marketing to millennials because the younger audience is skeptical of advertising or doesnt follow media that run the adswe are less likely to be attracted to the contrived imagery said burklin nielsen a millennial motorcyclist from dane countynielsen  says she watches television over the internet and gets most of her news and information onlinesocial and nontraditional media are probably the best ways to reach millennials like nielsenwe check facebook and instagram constantly she saidnielsen doesnt want to be stereotyped as a young adult with no responsibilities in reality she has a yearold daughter and a demanding careerlike other millennials she wants marketing material thats more akin to her lifestyle and interests including social causeswe all have some belief that we feel strongly about mine is making sure that women can get out and ride said nielsen director of operations for stilettos on steel a womens motorcyclist grouplocal influencemillennials often say they prefer local events over traditional advertising or large gatherings to learn about new thingswhat i really like to focus on are experiences i appreciate it when a company does more of a grassroots effort focused on building relationships said brenda martinez a yearold milwaukee motorcyclist and founder of litas in milwaukee a female riders groupmartinez owns a harleydavidson road king but said shes been attracted to royal enfield motorcycle events in milwaukeeindiabased royal enfield established its north american headquarters in milwaukees third ward and hired former harleydavidson executive rod copes as north american division presidentroyal enfield is the worlds oldest motorcycle company in continuous production the company known for its bikes that capture the essence of oldschool motorcycling — a throbbing engine simple electronics and a low price — is revered in india but is only now getting reestablished in the usit is back to the basics we are going back to what we believe motorcycling used to be when it was simple easy affordable and fun copes saidroyal enfield is focusing on local events in urban markets a few key national events and social media to reach millennialsharleydavidson also sees the value in social media and events large and small in connecting with a younger audiencewe often say its their turf their terms and we fish where the fish are spaeth saidharley was one of the partners in the mama tried motorcycle show earlier this year in milwaukee an event where more than  bikebuilders from across the nation displayed their workthe show included an indoor flattrack race at the uwm panther arenawe knew it was going to be successful given it was february but we had no idea that  people would show up many of which were young adults spaeth saidevents like the mama tried show rekindle the competitive spirit of the harley brandit helps us overcome that
