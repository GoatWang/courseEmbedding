nathaniel s butlernbaegetty images facebook twitter print new york knicks the miseducation of jr smith is the knicks erratic shooting guard misguided or just misunderstood by jonathan abrams on september   earl smith jr found salvation in his jump shot smith could always shoot and in basketball a shooter can live forever in college he clashed with his coach at new jersey’s monmouth university unable to understand why the second team remained the second team even when they were routinely drubbing the starters in practice when he’d finally had enough he confronted his coach said everything he wanted to say and stormed off that was the end of earl’s college career but his shot never left him he frequented belmar’s jersey shore league for the next decade making cameos in other semipro leagues popping up whenever a team needed someone who could stretch a defense in  earl passed on his genes his basketball acumen and his name to his first son earl joseph smith iii he placed toy hoops in every nook of the house he taught the boy to bend with his knees and push with his arms as he shot by the time the boy turned  he could sink free throws on a regular basis earl instructed the boy to do pushups — not too many but enough to build strength — and to use the form as an inverted model for his jump shot when another son arrived two years later the brothers practiced plays coordinated to numbers they gave and went on one they picked and rolled on two they jabbed and backdoored on three “defense was the last thing i taught them” earl explained “because you can make it without defense” earl wasn’t wrong the elder of the two brothers now admits that his father “taught me every fundamental that i know especially my shooting technique” that jumper sustains his nba career — but it doesn’t define a successful one you know the boy as jr smith a perplexing polarizing player and personality smith is one of the last members of the nba’s muchdebated preptopro generation he’s made money in bunches more than  million in his career and he will find a team long after his athleticism erodes — like his father he will always be able to shoot but he’s also defined by something that isn’t tangible untapped potential eight years into his starcrossed career coaches and fans still don’t know what to make of jr smith even today earl smith jr remains confident that the nba would have beckoned if only his path had veered a little differently he measured himself against nba players like vinnie johnson eddie jordan and james bailey while holding his own in the jersey league his association with those players linked him to a rapidly evolving nba during the late s and early s when larry and magic brought the nba to the masses television ratings swelled contracts ballooned players flew first class free agency ensured that rosters became less fluid from year to year salary discrepancies between stars and bench players had been thrown out of whack “the new salaries had made it more difficult” david halberstam once wrote in the breaks of the game “it had heightened natural tensions between teammates as it increased the differences that always existed” that same period laid the groundwork for the basketball philosophies of several other basketball lifers who would shape the education of smith jr’s oldest son john “pott” richardson began his climb to more than  wins while coaching the piners of lakewood high school in new jersey dan hurley started honing his game under the tutelage of his father bob byron scott capped a successful collegiate career and became a fixture of the “showtime” los angeles lakers under pat riley meanwhile george karl coached the cba’s montana golden nuggets stealing bit by bit from mentors larry brown doug moe and dean smith and mike woodson launched his nba career under the knicks’ red holzman after playing for bobby knight at indiana they would all eventually cross paths with jr smith their inability to make a lasting impression remains the most confounding thing about a confounding career richardson first noticed jr smith when he dominated the lakewood youth leagues as a yearold he called him “a court rat” smith eventually landed at lakewood after pit stops at steinert high and mccorristin catholic high — a red flag in retrospect — as people quickly noticed smith’s body didn’t resemble the body of a typical high school kid richardson remembers the camden high kids from milt wagner to his son dajuan always seeming more physically mature like men playing against boys now he had one for himself “he’s the only guy i ever coached” richardson said “that had that physical structure and could play outside face the basket at sixfive sixsix” the second thing everyone noticed smith’s jump shot with a simple flick of the wrist smith could drain s — or as richardson called them “pointers” — from laughable distances the coach started pushing his young star demanding that he finish first in sprints and stay late to work on that jumper smith obliged never challenging his coach for fear he’d be benched richardson still laughs at smith’s athletic prowess — like his ability to throw down putback dunks in one seamless motion or the bombs he launched that were closer to halfcourt than to the point line smith also prospered on lakewood’s football team where he played all over the field — wide receiver linebacker cornerback safety even quarterback — saved two games with field goal blocks scored a deciding touchdown on a blocked kick and routinely caught touchdown passes on soaring fade routes with one hand “he obviously made the right decision to concentrate on basketball” said nick eremita lakewood’s coach at the time “but i coached high school football for over  years and without a doubt he’s an nfltype player” clemson offered smith a football scholarship based solely on watching his game film something that didn’t surprise his coaches dave oizerowitz lakewood’s offensive coordinator at the time likened smith to “a more athletic and probably a faster plaxico burress” oizerowitz added “he was really just scratching the surface but the best thing about him he was a great kid he always had this big smile on his face and was always popping into the office asking ‘coach how are you doing” smith gave up football after transferring to st benedict’s preparatory school in newark where he repeated his junior year and played against better competition “i graduated high school when i was ” earl smith jr explained “i said my sons ain’t gonna do that if i can get that extra year out of them it makes a world of a difference” even though it would be smith’s fourth high school in three years randy holmes an assistant to richardson and one of smith’s mentors agreed with the move he admitted that “in order to get where jr had to get in life he had to leave lakewood he had to he could have scored  points at lakewood but that wouldn’t have really done anything for him he would have been allstate i don’t know if he would have been able to go to north carolina or the nba the critics would have said ‘who has he played against” richardson learned of the transfer while reading the local newspaper the smiths never discussed the decision with him though he knew it was inevitable “they weren’t forthright about it” richardson says “but it’s ok all is forgiven it’s in the past” you might remember a string bean kid named kevin garnett declaring for the nba draft right out of chicago’s farragut career academy high school the ncaa wanted him to skip his freshman basketball season and prove himself academically garnett had other ideas two decades earlier three ballyhooed high schoolers — darryl dawkins bill willoughby and moses malone — started playing professional basketball right out of high school only one of them reached his potential malone who eventually won three mvp awards in houston and philly but only after unsatisfying stops in utah st louis and buffalo in  shawn kemp entered the nba without playing college ball becoming a highflying sensation for the seattle supersonics that opened the door for garnett in  then a superior high school player but someone described by michael wilbon in the washington post as not “physically ready to play under the basket in the big ten much less against hakeem olajuwon and david robinson his skill level isn’t high enough he isn’t savvy enough” garnett proved his skeptics wrong quickly playing big minutes for minnesota and embarrassing every team that hadn’t scouted him when high schoolers kobe bryant and jermaine o’neal followed his lead nba scouts reluctantly began haunting high school gyms no one wanted to miss the next garnett or the next kobe and yet … everyone agreed this was heading in the wrong direction “i just always felt it was somewhat uncomfortable going into a high school gym and evaluating high school players” said pete babcock a former general manager of the atlanta hawks “it wasn’t where you should be it was just uncomfortable” you wouldn’t have found many people who believed jr smith could jump straight to the nba dan hurley remembers his father — a hall of fame coach at saint anthony high school in jersey city known for his disciplined demanding style — dropping in on st benedict’s games and rolling his eyes at smith’s shot selection dan hurley loved smith’s work ethic though in two years he never had to kick him out of a single practice saying now that smith wanted to get coached and that smith would have run through a wall for him the st benedict’s teachers also liked smith he quickly became one of the school’s most popular kids he lived on campus and was in bed by the  pm curfew every night “he was a guy that never expected anything” said father edwin leahy st benedict’s headmaster “a lot of these guys can be prima donnas there wasn’t any of that in him” leahy can only remember one incident in which smith was suspended for a game — after he and teammate alex galindo left campus without permission the reason they wanted haircuts before a big game meanwhile tales of smith’s exploits began to spread once he outscored an entire team for three quarters before hurley mercifully removed him from the game another time he pulled off a degree dunk as teammate bashir mason remembers “people literally in the middle of the game started running out of the stands and running onto the court” st benedict’s claimed the state championship during smith’s second junior year the next season smith set school records for points scored  pointers  and field goal percentage  says hurley now “it was amazing what he was able to do so effortlessly as a shooter and scorer god blessed him” smith entered the  mcdonald’s allamerican game as something of a national unknown that changed quickly — he sank five s scored a gamehigh  points and claimed comvp honors with a manchild named dwight howard eventually smith eschewed a commitment to north carolina and declared for the  nba draft a night that could have doubled as a high school graduation a record eight high schoolers were selected in the first  picks highlighted by howard going first to orlando over established college center emeka okafor after new orleans grabbed smith at no  he told the asbury park press that “sitting on the bench i would take that as a lesson whereas other guys might take that as an insult everyone’s not going to play right away it’s just a reality especially when you’re a rookie not everybody can be lebron or carmelo” if only it had been that easy smith’s first nba coach was byron scott someone who wasn’t accustomed to losing — the  hornets lost  games — and babysitting teenage shooting guards scott takes a more diplomatic stance these days remembering smith’s rookie season as “a little bit tougher than he probably expected” but also that “we knew he was going to be a hell of a player we also knew it was going to take some time” smith didn’t do himself any favors by practicing his halfcourt shot when his teammates queued up at the free throw line or joking around in the locker room after losses — two habits that irked scott and hornets veterans “it was probably tough on both of them” former hornets guard speedy claxton said “byron was oldschool he grew up under pat riley he’s probably one of the most hardnosed disciplined coaches there is jr was used to being the man and probably got away with a lot in high school it was a power struggle between them” smith’s father believes scott didn’t help jr nearly enough calling him a “good friend” before adding “you’ve got a kid out of high school you treat him as an adult and you can’t do that he’s with men and he’s done something wrong you need to guide him with your hand and say ‘no you don’t do that’ or every time he comes with his shirt out you fine him you’ve got to nurture him that’s with anything” holmes smith’s mentor from his lakewood days moved with smith to new orleans where he witnessed the realities of the professional game affecting smith’s confidence “for the first time in his basketball career he wasn’t the man” holmes said “coaches really got on him byron scott is oldschool it’s his way or no way you can just sit on that bench and rot if you don’t do what the coach wants you to do or you don’t get it” their already tenuous relationship was irrevocably shattered during smith’s second season which the hornets split between new orleans and oklahoma city in the aftermath of hurricane katrina they went months without speaking to each other smith’s playing time and scoring dropped despite the addition of spectacular rookie point guard chris paul — someone who should have made smith better in every way when scott benched him while the hornets were depleted by injuries smith vented to the timespicayune about his coach’s “big” ego bemoaning their lack of communication while essentially begging for a trade the hornets accommodated him in  by flipping pj brown and smith to chicago for tyson chandler six days later chicago sent him to denver for two secondround picks asked what he learned about dealing with coaches smith ominously told the timespicayune “just play your game because you’ll probably be around a lot longer than they will” now with his third team in as many seasons smith ran the risk of becoming another cautionary tale someone mentioned in the same sentence as korleone young and leon smith meanwhile nba commissioner david stern was becoming increasingly mortified by the collective immaturity of the league’s younger players and the effect it was having on nba scouting in  the nba mandated that americanborn players must be at least  years old and at least one year removed from high school to be drafteligible for the league stern wanted to push even further lobbying for an age minimum of  — he wanted nba personnel out of high school gyms altogether naturally earl smith jr disagrees with that stance “come out of high school and you’re in the top  of the nba draft you go to college you get exposed now you’re out the draft you’ve got to get the money when you can go and make a few million dollars without doing that manual labor you can get an education later i know how hard it is i worked a long time to even try and make a million dollars it don’t come easy” if earl really believes his son didn’t need those two years in college that may be all you need to know about jr smith’s nba career “jr smith ready to revise career the young guard hopes to earn starting spot alter troublesome perception developed with hornets” — denver post october   “jr smith starring as the graduate young nuggets guard maturing into steady and coachable player” — denver post april   “smith showing maturity jail time this summer has given jr a new purpose for game life” — denver post september   “smith displaying signs of progress nuggets guard vows to improve and yes defend” — denver post october   “every october i wrote the same feature story ‘is this the year jr turns it around and grows up” said benjamin hochman the nuggets beat writer for the denver post who also covered smith in new orleans “you get jr talking about how he’s matured and george karl saying how he hopes jr will play more defense and be part of a system every year jr would not mature and not grow as a player or as a person” no relationship has ever captured the nba’s conflicting generations better than karl and smith — even years later it’s impossible to forget the incredulous expressions on karl’s face whenever smith launched one of his patented footers at the worst possible time they were doomed from the start earl smith jr remembers riding a stationary bike in the nuggets’ training facility and seeing karl enter with his assistants unaware that earl was jr’s father “i’m going to bust that smith kid’s ass” smith jr overheard karl say to his staff before realizing that his father was present smith jr encouraged karl to coach his son smith jr promised to remain just a father but karl and jr smith clashed early and often mostly over playing time for someone like karl a basketball lifer who learned at the feet of dean smith at north carolina and has watched the nba dramatically evolve over three decades jr smith presented a special kind of challenge after particularly poor play from smith in game  of a playoff series against the spurs in  karl memorably hissed “i just love the dignity of the game being insulted right in front of me” click here for part two click here for part one when karl reflects on his time with smith he sees a systemic problem too many young players he said are more concerned with claiming new contracts than championships karl witnessed the power struggle firsthand watching carmelo anthony’s contract desire fracture a potential playoff contender “when you’re fighting for a contract it gets confused” karl said “then when you have aau basketball and ncaa basketball and the power of entitlement the power of the posse you don’t know who’s in a guy’s ear all the time “i’ve got two and a half hours with  guys” karl continued “there’s no leader in the world or coach in the world that can motivate or energize all  of them there are probably going to be three or four that are going to feel left out there are going to be two or three that are going to feel picked on” nuggets fans couldn’t understand why karl refused to unleash a player with such obvious talent “there’s always the potential of a volatile relationship when you have a young kid trying to find his way paired with an established veteran successful coach who likes things the way they like them done” said rex chapman the team’s vicepresident of player personnel at the time “smith came in and he didn’t know who he was he tried to be carmelo we traded for allen iverson he tried to be like allen it wasn’t until a year or so later that jr really started to become more comfortable with himself and tried to be jr once he did that we saw a real growth in his game as well as a more mature guy off the court” karl typically voiced his displeasure with smith through the media a tactic that didn’t endear him to smith or his family “you start talking about a young kid and you’re the head coach and you’re going to the media and saying ‘he’ll shoot you in the game he’ll shoot you out” smith jr said “now the media picks up on it you know what i told jr i told him ‘every time you get in shoot it he’s going to take you out anyway so you might as well shoot it’ and that’s what he did” “ you know what i told jr i told him ‘every time you get in shoot it he’s going to take you out anyway so you might as well shoot it ” — earl smith jr jr’s father jr smith turned his body into a bright canvas during his denver stint flames shot up his shooting arm with the words “through the fire” streaking underneath his nickname “swish” appeared under his chin a rendering of his mom is on his chest and cartoon characters and the words “just klownin” are on his back he has the words “in love with my money” inked on him as well the letters “demi” in honor of one of his two daughters on the knuckles of his right hand for a while smith’s transgressions seemed harmless — just an immature kid acting out but his troubles eventually turned tragic in  smith illegally sped past another car hurtled through a stop sign and broadsided another vehicle andre bell smith’s high school friend and passenger died from injuries he sustained in the crash neither bell nor smith was wearing a seat belt smith spent only  days in jail in the summer of  for reckless driving the associated press reported that smith racked up two more speeding tickets and three license suspensions in new jersey between the crash and sentencing the nba suspended him for seven games but the repercussions of that accident will never fade “it affected us in a million different ways” father leahy said “they were great friends he’s got to live with that day for the rest of his life could he have made another decision should he have made another decision” smith vowed to grow up after the accident dropping “jr” and briefly changing his name to “earl” it didn’t last long neither did his renewed commitment to defense or his ability to accept his role as a gamechanging scorer off the bench which karl insisted was smith’s ultimate professional destiny “i never understood this” smith jr said “i’m looking at all the other nba teams and who they’ve got coming off the bench there’s no spark you’re supposed to play your best five i still don’t understand that to this day ‘we needed a spark off the bench’ well you’ve got seven other players who are supposed to be nba players they all should be sparks think about it you’re paying all these guys this money and you don’t got no spark on the bench well you shouldn’t have nobody on the bench” “that’s commentary of people that really have never coached” karl responded after hearing smith jr’s take “not starting doesn’t mean a thing the guys who finish the game are the guys who are most important they are the ones who coaches are going to cater the game to and structure the game around sometimes it’s easier for a talented player to come off the bench just the thought process of being a starter is overrated and i think it affects players i don’t deny that it affects players but as a coach i think the power of the bench is as important to me as the five guys who start the game” jr smith is clear about the best and worst parts of his time in denver the highs the fans the lows “the coaching i think if our coaching would have brought us together more we would have had more success” smith remembers his relationship with karl changing dramatically after the knicks and nuggets‘ brawl in  which resulted in a game suspension for carmelo anthony smith believes karl never fully forgave him for smith’s part in instigating the melee in smith’s five seasons with denver the talented nuggets routinely flamed out early in the playoffs with one notable exception in  after respected veteran chauncey billups arrived denver stretched the lakers to six games in the western conference finals “we couldn’t do nothing with kobe at that time” smith says now skipping over the fact that they played the same position after anthony pushed for and received a blockbuster knicks trade in  smith left denver the following summer and eventually joined him there karl admits that “it ended in a way that i’m not totally satisfied” before adding “i’m disappointed that i couldn’t connect a little better and be the guy that led him to the next step the next stage of specialness in the same sense i think both of us tried i don’t think it was a relationship that was ugly i wish i would have been able to give him more time and answer his questions rather than be the dictator of his future jr kind of came to us as a player that no one wanted and we already had melo we already had i think ai on the team we already had marcus camby and nene we had a lot of guys that needed my attention i think we could have had more success if he was one of our top two or three guys early in our stint together where maybe i would have spent more time explaining what i wanted explaining where i wanted him to go and what i wanted him to do rather than being the dictator of what was going on” after last season’s lockout ended karl’s nuggets became one of the league’s surprise success stories surging into the playoffs and dragging an experienced lakers team to seven games ironically they were given a major boost by midseason acquisition javale mcgee — like smith a talented enigma who never reached his potential on his previous team you could say karl is batting one for two over the summer the nuggets traded for andre iguodala another lowmaintenance highreward player who weaves right into denver’s fabric “this is the most excited i’ve been in the summer for a long time” karl admitted for the first time in years the nuggets might actually have great chemistry jim cleamons helped the  lakers to a championship as their lockdown defender he sat on phil jackson’s benches in chicago and los angeles and he watched how michael jordan and kobe bryant approached practice and games for the better part of two decades cleamons also struggled to harness a famously spoiled team of young millionaires — the  mavericks who imploded when jason kidd jim jackson and jamal mashburn couldn’t get along — and assisted scott during smith’s rookie season he believes smith couldn’t handle himself as a professional or an adult because he wasn’t prepared for the nba lifestyle “there’s so much about the game that high schoolers do not understand” cleamons says “that you cannot tell them that they don’t understand because it’s basketball and they’ve been playing basketball since they were in elementary school but they haven’t played it at this level against grown men who they haven’t heard about and don’t have any respect for but are actually pretty good even though they are not allstar marquee players it’s not jr it’s the system” cleamons saw smith up close recently when he coached china’s zhejiang guangsha last season his squad beat smith’s zhejiang golden bulls twice after smith signed there during the lockout to nobody’s surprise that relationship ended badly — smith and the golden bulls both claimed the other did not live up to their contractual obligations the organization claimed smith missed nearly every practice even though he led the team in scoring with  points per game “he definitely played more liberated” cleamons laughed “the fact is they want americans to score he knew he was the guy i don’t think there was a game he didn’t try to get  or  points just because he could” smith filed a lawsuit to recoup the nearly  million the organization docked him his father said the team reneged on other services stipulated in his contract — even basic amenities like a driver and a stipend for food “i didn’t visit” he said laughing “they told me some horror stories i know myself i’d probably be in a chinese jail right now” smith landed in new york in time for the team’s brief  playoff run sophisticated knicks fans appreciate what george karl appreciated in the right situation smith can be a gamechanging scorer off the bench a streaky and dangerous player someone who feeds off the intensity of the home crowd maybe it’s not the identity smith wanted for himself but it’s better than nothing he never became kobe bryant but he avoided becoming korleone young too if you listed the careers of all the high schoolers who jumped to the nba from  through  smith would probably finish above the mean of the  players drafted out of high school since  only five have made an allstar team and smith enjoyed the fourth most productive career — behind howard al jefferson and josh smith — of the eight high schoolers drafted in his class at the same time everyone agrees he could have been better “we’re talking out of both sides of our mouths” cleamons says “and young players are caught in the middle because they are impressionable because they want to play and they want approval we want to talk about them doing things and then when it doesn’t happen we want to throw them under the bus and say ‘they haven’t done this they haven’t done that’ well is it their fault or is it the way we teach them is it our expectation of what we want from them it’s the whole kit and kaboodle it’s pure unadulterated american capitalism vs coaches who are trying to win ballgames and championships — and the kids are caught in the middle” in august jr smith seems relaxed at the jr smith youth foundation annual golf event he shakes hands and shares hugs with family attendees and knicks officials before finally ducking into the clubhouse of lakewood’s eagle ridge golf club his daughter demi sits at his side playing games on his iphone smith keeps a careful eye on her as he navigates an interview with a reporter “the perception is i’m a sex drugs and rock and roll type of person” he says “the reality is i’m kind of like an ocean everything is calm calm calm i’m good when the ball goes up in the air the waves start rocking” smith has always been considered a selfish player a gunner looking out for his own numbers but there’s another side to smith that the public rarely sees he paid for his brother chris’s tuition when louisville reverted his scholarship status to walkon in order to land a bigger recruiting class his foundation helps pay school and camp tuition fees for underprivileged children smith also contributed money to relief efforts after hurricane katrina “ i’m not going to sit here and tell you i’m the white angel but i’m not the dark demon either ” — jr smith eight years into his nba career many are losing hope in smith realizing his allstar potential he’s not completely sure where the blame lies “it’s a teenager trying to grow up in a man’s world” smith said of his trying relationships with scott and karl “coming from jersey and the mcdonald’s allamerican game i’m expecting to be treated a certain way because all my peers that i came out with everyone was being treated a certain way so i kind of felt entitled to that it was more than just earning it it’s definitely a fault of mine as well as theirs it goes hand in hand i just can’t point the finger at them a few actions i made probably didn’t help too i’m not going to sit here and tell you i’m the white angel but i’m not the dark demon either” how did a oncecoachable kid with a supportive family become such a hassle for nba coaches was this simply teenage rebellion writ large richardson wonders if these last few years right down to the tattoos represent smith “making up for lost time” emerging as “expressions of certain freedoms” holmes agrees pointing out that smith wasn’t permitted much of a social life by his parents “he never went to a prom or anything rightfully so” he said “that was part of his liberation expressing himself getting out of that mode” there might be something to that or it could be simpler had jr smith gone to north carolina for two years he might be a fivetime allstar right now we’ll never know when mike woodson took over new york’s head coaching job after mike d’antoni’s dismissal last march he mentioned smith’s maturation as being crucial to his success “he has to be more professional about how he handles things” woodson told reporters “my job as a coach is to make sure he gets there” for the next two months smith played more minutes took more shots and played capable sometimes even inspired defense for woodson “it’s the best relationship i had with a coach ever other than playing with my dad” smith said “he definitely treats you like a man from what i understand until you’ve proven otherwise he’s such a levelheaded person and he wants to see his players do well he puts his personal agenda and goals aside to see his players do well a lot of people wouldn’t do that a lot of coaches players or gms owners wouldn’t do that” now  smith reupped with the knicks this summer for two years and  million he holds an option for the second year woodson will continue to mentor him or try to mentor him growing up with  siblings woodson learned how to juggle all kinds of personalities he’s considered a “player’s coach” someone who allowed smith and anthony significantly greater freedom in his offense you won’t see many appalled head shakes from woodson after one of smith’s patented footers with  seconds left on the shot clock he wants his guys to play freely maybe even a little recklessly — a blessing and a curse for someone like jr smith “coach woodson reminds me of my head coach and how he dealt with jr” holmes said comparing woodson to richardson “he gets on jr’s case but at the end of the day jr knows it’s business and he doesn’t mean any harm by it jr responds well to that type of coach” that doesn’t mean things are stable for smith in march he sparked a brief media firestorm when he tweeted a photo of a woman’s posterior drawing a  fine from the nba to go with his  hours of sports blog ignominy then he was arrested in miami two months later for his failure to appear in court — this time for operating a motor scooter without a proper driver’s license for the last four months he’s been dramafree whether anyone believes that can last … that’s another story “like a lot of guys in this sound bite culture he can come off as unsympathetic at times” chapman said “but the one thing is when you’re around jr day in and day out it’s really hard not to like him” it’s something you’ll hear about jr smith over and over says mason now the head coach at wagner college “if i called jr right now and said i needed him to come to campus and talk to the guys there’s no doubt in my mind that he would be here in the drop of a dime to help me out he would do that for anybody that he was close to or in our circle he’s just a loyal guy i’ve got no issues being in the foxhole with him he would have my back no matter the situation” how could such a loyal guy give so many coaches so many headaches we know he’s the product of a nowdefunct system that favored expectations over achievement a system that allowed young players to feel entitled when they hadn’t actually earned anything yet but how does that explain descendants of dean smith pat riley and bob knight coaching smith without ever getting through was he just destined to become a memorable player who never truly reached his potential — no different from his father just playing on a larger stage when will people like rex chapman stop saying things like “he’s got all the tools to be an allstar consistency is probably the one thing that will keep him from getting there” leave it to the only man who followed him from new orleans to denver the one who’s written his story time and again to put jr smith’s career in perspective “talentwise” said benjamin hochman “jr smith should be better than jr smith” adrian wojnarowski’s wonderful book the miracle of st anthony about a season with hurley is required reading for basketball buffs leahy once had to explain the suspension to an nba scout doing work on smith’s background “there was stunned silence on the other end of the phone” leahy said “the guy probably said ‘you’re kidding me aren’t you’ but that was hurley and that was us he was not involved with marijuana or nothing it was just because he left school and got a haircut that’s why he sat him and he didn’t play it was against the rules for a kid who lived here to leave the property without permission” the three other high school players chosen in the lottery — shaun livingston robert swift and sebastian telfair — all fell short of their nba expectations smith’s rant “i wasn’t surprised at all about being benched because his ego is too big in order to put something petty aside and try to win the game at this point something has to be done i’m not going to prosper from this situation when you can’t communicate with the head guy something is wrong i come in early stay in late and if that don’t work i don’t know what will so there is nothing for me to do i’ve approached him numerous times tried to call set up meetings — no communication every team i’ve been on i’ve always been friends with the head coach” “the first thing they see is all the tattoos” smith jr said of his son “well he didn’t have all of them before they say ‘aw you shouldn’t have let them happen’ you’ll understand as a parent you’ve got to give something to get something a lot of parents don’t and then when they don’t guess what you and your son is bumping heads or you and your daughter is bumping heads and they are cussing you out and you don’t have that bond but we’ve got that bond i’ve never had them cussing out or disagreeing” smith’s mom ida said she doesn’t have a big problem with the body art “i definitely don’t want him to have as many as he has but i don’t know for a guy it doesn’t look bad and he doesn’t have any devilworshipping signs or anything” among smith’s troubles in denver a game suspension for his role in the knicksnuggets brawl in  a team suspension for pouring champagne and spitting on a woman at a nightclub and closing his twitter account he later opened another one after being accused of writing in a way that associated himself with the bloods gang karl was not specifically responding to smith jr’s comments “they said he never practiced a day there which is wrong” smith jr continued about his son’s experience in china “i’ve got pictures and videos of some of his practices he had a good game and afterward you don’t have to come to practice for a couple of days one time he was ready to leave they said ‘if you leave we’re going to slander your name because you know how you are you are one of the bad boys of the nba’ this is the coach and the assistant telling jr all this” chris smith will open training camp with the knicks and fight for one of the final roster spots he has a decent chance of making the team “it’s going to be fun” jr said of having his brother on the team “it’ll be tougher for him than it is on me i think he’ll surprise a lot of people” chris smith said the two last played together on a youth team when they were  and  they won the championship “hopefully it’ll be just like last time” he said “our expectation is to get a championship” smith said of the approaching season “anything shorter than that is a failure everything on paper we’ve got that there’s nothing a team has that we don’t have this year is a championship year or a no year” “you know what” smith jr said of the picture “i wasn’t mad i looked at it i smiled like a lot of us did you know what i’m saying i wasn’t mad i wasn’t mad at all i just smiled as a man” time has also eased the relationship between scott and smith “we talk to each other in the summer” scott said “he keeps talking about how he wants to play golf with me now that he’s taken up golf” facebook twitter print share filed under new york knicks teams jonathan abrams is a staff writer for grantland his book boys among men how the preptopro generation
