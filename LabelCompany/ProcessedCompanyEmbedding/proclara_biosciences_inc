neurodegenerative and other diseasesour lead product candidate npt is currently in clinical development for the treatment of alzheimer’s disease we are also advancing preclinical programs in a broad range of neurodegenerative and systemic amyloidosis diseases learn more about our phase b clinical trial of npt pipeline nptproclara bioscience’s lead development program npt is a fusion protein combining gaim with the backbone of a human immunoglobulin and is delivered by intravenous administration because it acts on both protein aggregates implicated in alzheimer’s disease – amyloidβ aβ and tau – npt may be better suited to treat the complex pathophysiology of the disease than other monotherapies currently in developmentproclara recently completed a phase a safety study of npt involving  healthy volunteers which demonstrated that a single administration appears to be both safe and well tolerated at multiple dose levelswe are currently midway through conducting a phase b multiple ascending dose study of npt which will enroll up to  patients diagnosed with probable alzheimer’s disease the randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of npt as well as pharmacokinetics immunogenicity and pharmacodynamic effects on biomarkers characteristicsnptnpt is a nd generation gaimimmunoglobulin fusion designed to lower the risk of human immunogenicity and displaying potent targeting of misfolded aggregated protein deposits found in systemic amyloidoses such as transthyretin ttr and antibody light chain al aggregates npt is currently proceeding through manufacturing development and being evaluated in preclinical animal safety studies in preparation for ind filing and clinical testing to commence in h rd generation candidatesin addition to our two drug candidates npt and npt proclara has conducted extensive structure activity relationship sar research to identify rd generation candidates using our gaim

biosciences contact us → our science — proclara biosciences our scienceproclara’s novel approach to treating protein misfolding diseases is based on the fact that many toxic aggregates of misfolded proteins share a common characteristic – the amyloid protein fold – that represents a unique target for drug development most current therapies being investigated for neurodegenerative diseases target only a single type of misfolded protein not addressing the fact that these diseases are often characterized by the buildup of multiple types of pathologic protein aggregates our scientists have developed a novel proprietary technology known as gaim or general amyloid interaction motif that simultaneously targets multiple misfolded proteins implicated in neurodegenerative diseases potentially creating a more robust response that could be suitable for patients at all stages of disease progressionour gaimbased therapies use a novel mechanism to bind to the amyloid fold of toxic protein aggregates of various types including amyloidβ aβ tau and asynuclein aggregates which accumulate in brain to cause alzheimer’s and parkinson’s disease and antibody light chain al or transthyretin ttr aggregates which accumulate in peripheral organs to cause systemic amyloidosis orphan diseases our therapies are designed to prevent the further accumulation of aggregates and clear existing

pipeline progress proclara biosciences a biotechnology company developing novel therapies for diseases caused by protein misfolding today announced recent progress across its product pipeline the company will continue its ongoing phase b trial of npt in patients with alzheimers disease following the positive recommendation of the trials independent data monitoring committee this recommendation is based on a review of interim safety data compiled from the trial to date which show that npt was safe and welltolerated in patients treated at a dose of  mgkg once monthly for six months proclara remains on track to report topline data from all trial participants in the summer of  in addition proclara announced that it will develop npt its next generation drug candidate for the treatment of orphan peripheral amyloidoses npt utilizes proclaras proprietary general amyloid interaction motif gaim technology to target multiple toxic protein aggregates including amyloidß aß tau asynuclein antibody light chain al and transthyretin ttr proclara expects to file an investigational new drug ind application with the us food and drug administration fda in the first half of  we are encouraged by the initial interim data from our phase b trial of npt in patients with alzheimers disease these data demonstrate that npt is generally safe and well tolerated given in repeat doses and it may overcome hurdles that have historically limited progress in the space said suzanne bruhn phd president and chief executive officer of proclara we are also pleased to announce our development strategy for npt the second compound to emerge from our gaimbased technology platform by simultaneously targeting multiple misfolded proteins our therapies have great potential to improve the lives of patients with diseases driven by the toxic effects of misfolded protein deposits including agerelated neurodegenerative diseases and orphan amyloidoses npt phase b study detailsproclaras phase b study of npt was initiated in september  and is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerabilit of multiple doses of npt as well as its pharmacokinetic immunogenicity and pharmacodynamic characteristics as measured by amyloidß and tau pet imaging in patients with mildtomoderate alzheimers disease and ßamyloidosis and tauopathy the trial is a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled study that will enroll up to  patients in four dose cohorts the company is currently enrolling the second patient cohort proclara expects to release topline efficacy data in the summer of  successful completion of the phase b study is expected to support phase  and  development programs for alzheimers disease and parkinsons disease about alzheimers diseasealzheimers disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia a progressive and irreversible brain disorder that impacts memory and thinking skills alzheimers often affects the ability to carry out basic daily activities
