fund “feeder” initially began operations in august  as separate investment funds within a masterfeeder structure with the feeder investing substantially all of its assets into the fund both the fund and feeder had the same investment objectives but each operated as a separate entity and issued shares separately with differing fee structures and with feeder shareholders bearing a proportional share of the fund’s operating expenses in addition to the feeder’s own expenses as described in the initial prospectus having received both sec and board approval in may  the fund converted and offers multiple share classes as part of this conversion each feeder shareholder received a new class of fund shares “class a” shares in proportion to and in exchange for each such shareholder’s existing feeder shares at then current net asset values the feeder fund will thereafter be liquidated and cease to exist also existing fund shareholders continue to hold their originally issued shares reclassified as “class i” shares in each case the original fee structures rights and privileges of any of the exchanged or reclassified shares remain unchanged however the conversion positively impacts holders of class a shares by lowering their annual expense ratio as compared to that applicable to holding feeder shares because the revised expense limitation and reimbursement agreement between the adviser and the fund limits class a expenses to  per annum on specified expenses instead of  previously for the feeder in may  the fund commenced offering the two separate classes of
