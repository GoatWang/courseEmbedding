of a proprietary highly purified form of the staphylococcal protein a which is an immunomodulatory protein produced by staphylococcus aureus bacteria prtx has the ability at very low concentrations to bind to human blymphocytes and macrophages and to modulate immune processes that mediate inflammation in certain autoimmune diseases laboratory studies indicate that the mechanism involves interaction with specific immunologic signaling pathways preclinical animal studies also demonstrate that very low doses of prtx have potent therapeutic effects in certain models of immune mediated inflammatory diseases to date human clinical studies indicate that prtx is generally safe and well tolerated at all dose levels evaluated staphylococcal protein a spa is a bacterial virulence factor which structurally consists of five homologous immunoglobulin ig binding domains placed in tandem each spa domain is capable of binding with high affinity to the fc region of human igg and also binds to the fab framework region of igs in the mammalian vh gene family this ability to bind to vh igs results in spa being one of the best characterized mammalian bcell superantigens nonclinical papers suggest that spa in the presence of excess serum igg may form small complexes of spa and igg  which in vitro and in vivo can induce ‘alternatively activated’ or ‘regulatory’ macrophages these have an antiinflammatory phenotype and such complexes may have activity in the mouse collagen induced arthritis model spa also interacts directly with vh b cells in mice and at doses of  or  mgkg can cause activation followed by apoptosis of vh expressing bcells  moks t abrahmsen l nilsson b et al eur j biochem – langone jj das c mainwaring r shearer wt mol cell biochem – graille m stura e corper l et
