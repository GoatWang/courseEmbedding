exists in the market place it definitely helps cre professionals get the job done for the multifamily person a lot has changed since  and with the purchase of several mf ilss you can bet we have the best information i wish all my mf friends and clients had costar as for the service certainly everyone has had thier experience and it may very well been awful however if you have a good rep and trainer it shouldnt be my advice is always reach out to your local rep before contacting  customer service this should guarantee a better experience something to note contracts are  months and no flexibility exists it is all in the contract so hopefully your rep communicates all the imperative details but we are all in the business of signing contracts so be sure you read it hopefully this helps some folks out san diego costar rep they have called me multiple times a day i finally got an employee named roberto to tell me who they were he told me in very general terms that they were collecting information for economic development in tennessee and that my information would not be used for any marketing purposes he specifically said that in addition to other agencies they would provide my information to the tennessee department of economic community development the various numbers from which i have received calls are all with area code        and that is in  days i have adamantly told them to stop calling me and to put me on the do not call list we shall see if they stop so bad information is missing  out of date  incorrect you can get better info from free google searches on public record sites they will lock you into a contract and you will regret it every day thereafter every day they call pretending to be interesting in renting an apartment i have asked them many times to stop calling me to remove anything related to our building from apartments com but they keep calling fishing for information to place on their website they always call from spoofed phone numbers that if you try to call back they are numbers not in service this is harassment stop calling me they just called my work place claiming to be loop net a commercial real estate agency asked me a sht ton of questions time wasters all they want is information they can get it off google just like i got theirs and they can see that i know that they are full of sht these people hound real estate agents for data endless calls asking you for information about what listings you have what leases you have signed then they turn around and try to sell you this data for thousands of dollars only a select few can afford costar yet they expect everyone to spend their time helping them maintain their databases xcelligent has a very similar service at a fraction of the cost so i use them and i only provide my data to them costar leaves tricky messages where they ask if a property is still available but they dont say it is them calling so they try and make you think you are returning a sales call dumb call center tricks they are asking you to list for free then they call every month to sell services we keep telling them we dont need we advertised with costar for years and we received zero leads and this is how cheep they are  they call my tool free number to sell me services will never give you a penny but you are costing me money every time you call stop it sales people tell so many lies first they told me costar has every listing from loopnet which company they bought not true i caught them a couple of times and they just gloss over secondly the listing i put on costar i cannot really find it using google which means i have to manually put in a separate listing on loopnet after paying  more than loopnet premium loopnet does much better organic search marketing than costar even with a free account so dont fall for these guys and dont pay for a subscription i would do no stars if i could we have had costar for several years and the customer service has declined each year they are much like the cable and phone companies they get you under contract and then the service stops my bill has been incorrect for  months now and no one seems to care especially not my local rep glad we are starting to see competitors come to our market so we can eliminate costar all together the contracts are a must for their business model otherwise they would be out of business look for an alternative if you can hopefully the costar monopoly is coming to an end update   costar figured out a way to get us up and running this morning it is a shame that we have to resort to social media and a massive emailphone campaign to get things done as promised even though a few days late we knew you could do it hey costar spend more time working and less making excuses you guys still have the best commercial property data analytics and reports   you guys have not changed good data but very poor customer service once the agreement is signed i was told by sales rep that costar prides themselves on a two day turn around two days after talking for a year waiting out our contract with xxxxx and negotiating for two weeks on the contract we agreed to terms on friday  received the contract monday morning  which we promptly turned around a fully executed contract in anticipation of having access no later than  i was just told we would not have access until tuesday  piss poor customer service somethings really never change especially when associated with costar they hire young kids that are very unprofessional stay away from this company the only good thing is they hire people that would be flipping burgers now if they would train them with some professionalism seems to be a company that is hard up for business and money any good company would treat customers better all the negative review are true could not get training had to learn on our own and then they wanted to charge more for the service they did not provide as soon as there contract is up we will cancel costar group  great product with appalling customer service we became customer a few months ago and still cannot get an account reptrainer assigned to us i followed up at least once in the past four weeks and the unresponsiveness is really frustrating not even mentioning the  number i have also expressed this frustration via costar group facebook but they do not seem to care very much where is their marketing and pr department costar is a bully have you ever read their contract the only way out of your contract is bankruptcy even if you never log in or use their services and ask them to work with you because you had some cash flow issues all i asked for was to move my start date since i didnt use their service because i didnt feel right using something i would have problems paying for you dont get to read the contract that you sign right there with their sales reps no one checks in with you if you dont login and now that they own loopnet  they double your costs so that none of the smaller firms can afford their services either i will never use costar i have cancelled by loopnet and i will be using mls commercial source xceligent and catalyst this place is ridiculous they harass call people and they call my property management company about  times a day when confronted about if they work for costar group they lie if you are reading this review for some miraculous reason please stop harassing people and pick up your own phone i have called them multiple times to get off of their calling list and they act like they do not know who to transfer you too please do not use this place because they waste peoples time with fake phone calls and harassment loopnet and costar deserve a zero rating by far the most dishonest company ive dealt with in a while i signed up for a loppnet subscription thinking it was a monthly plan it turns out it was an annual commitment and when i tried to cancel i even suggested early termination fee they said they

would leverage to start the costar group after college mr florance returned to washington dc and began to buy and renovate abandoned buildings he quickly grew frustrated with the quality of real estate information that was available and used his software knowledge to develop a commercial multiplelisting database service at the time brokers spent a large amount of time and money manually gathering information that was then shared with others florances concept was to centralize the process and make the information available to subscribers putting economies of scale to work so that brokers could eliminate research staffs and obtain more accurate and comprehensive information at less expense this commercial real estate database is the core of costar product offerings report you

a review events talk log in     l st nwwashington dc    i work here and i want to speak to some of the reviews the product is amazing and nothing like it exists in the market place it definitely helps cre professionals get the job done for the multifamily person a lot has changed since  and with the purchase of several mf ilss you can bet we have the best information i wish all my mf friends and clients had costar as for the service certainly everyone has had thier experience and it may very well been awful however if you have a good rep and trainer it shouldnt be my advice is always reach out to your local rep before contacting  customer service this should guarantee a better experience something to note contracts are  months and no flexibility exists it is all in the contract so hopefully your rep communicates all the imperative details but we are all in the business of signing contracts so be sure you read it hopefully this helps some folks out san diego costar rep they have called me multiple times a day i finally got an employee named roberto to tell me who they were he told me in very general terms that they were collecting information for economic development in tennessee and that my information would not be used for any marketing purposes he specifically said that in addition to other agencies they would provide my information to the tennessee department of economic community development the various numbers from which i have received calls are all with area code        and that is in  days i have adamantly told them to stop calling me and to put me on the do not call list we shall see if they stop so bad information is missing  out of date  incorrect you can get better info from free google searches on public record sites they will lock you into a contract and you will regret it every day thereafter every day they call pretending to be interesting in renting an apartment i have asked them many times to stop calling me to remove anything related to our building from apartments com but they keep calling fishing for information to place on their website they always call from spoofed phone numbers that if you try to call back they are numbers not in service this is harassment stop calling me they just called my work place claiming to be loop net a commercial real estate agency asked me a sht ton of questions time wasters all they want is information they can get it off google just like i got theirs and they can see that i know that they are full of sht these people hound real estate agents for data endless calls asking you for information about what listings you have what leases you have signed then they turn around and try to sell you this data for thousands of dollars only a select few can afford costar yet they expect everyone to spend their time helping them maintain their databases xcelligent has a very similar service at a fraction of the cost so i use them and i only provide my data to them costar leaves tricky messages where they ask if a property is still available but they dont say it is them calling so they try and make you think you are returning a sales call dumb call center tricks they are asking you to list for free then they call every month to sell services we keep telling them we dont need we advertised with costar for years and we received zero leads and this is how cheep they are  they call my tool free number to sell me services will never give you a penny but you are costing me money every time you call stop it sales people tell so many lies first they told me costar has every listing from loopnet which company they bought not true i caught them a couple of times and they just gloss over secondly the listing i put on costar i cannot really find it using google which means i have to manually put in a separate listing on loopnet after paying  more than loopnet premium loopnet does much better organic search marketing than costar even with a free account so dont fall for these guys and dont pay for a subscription i would do no stars if i could we have had costar for several years and the customer service has declined each year they are much like the cable and phone companies they get you under contract and then the service stops my bill has been incorrect for  months now and no one seems to care especially not my local rep glad we are starting to see competitors come to our market so we can eliminate costar all together the contracts are a must for their business model otherwise they would be out of business look for an alternative if you can hopefully the costar monopoly is coming to an end update   costar figured out a way to get us up and running this morning it is a shame that we have to resort to social media and a massive emailphone campaign to get things done as promised even though a few days late we knew you could do it hey costar spend more time working and less making excuses you guys still have the best commercial property data analytics and reports   you guys have not changed good data but very poor customer service once the agreement is signed i was told by sales rep that costar prides themselves on a two day turn around two days after talking for a year waiting out our contract with xxxxx and negotiating for two weeks on the contract we agreed to terms on friday  received the contract monday morning  which we promptly turned around a fully executed contract in anticipation of having access no later than  i was just told we would not have access until tuesday  piss poor customer service somethings really never change especially when associated with costar they hire young kids that are very unprofessional stay away from this company the only good thing is they hire people that would be flipping burgers now if they would train them with some professionalism seems to be a company that is hard up for business and money any good company would treat customers better all the negative review are true could not get training had to learn on our own and then they wanted to charge more for the service they did not provide as soon as there contract is up we will cancel costar group  great product with appalling customer service we became customer a few months ago and still cannot get an account reptrainer assigned to us i followed up at least once in the past four weeks and the unresponsiveness is really frustrating not even mentioning the  number i have also expressed this frustration via costar group facebook but they do not seem to care very much where is their marketing and pr department costar is a bully have you ever read their contract the only way out of your contract is bankruptcy even if you never log in or use their services and ask them to work with you because you had some cash flow issues all i asked for was to move my start date since i didnt use their service because i didnt feel right using something i would have problems paying for you dont get to read the contract that you sign right there with their sales reps no one checks in with you if you dont login and now that they own loopnet  they double your costs so that none of the smaller firms can afford their services either i will never use costar i have cancelled by loopnet and i will be using mls commercial source xceligent and catalyst this place is ridiculous they harass call people and they call my property management company about  times a day when confronted about if they work for costar group they lie if you are reading this review for some miraculous reason please stop harassing people and pick up your own phone i have called them multiple times to get off of their calling list and they act like they do not know who to transfer you too please do not use this place because they waste peoples time with fake phone calls and harassment loopnet and costar deserve a zero rating by far the most dishonest company ive dealt with in a while i signed up for a loppnet subscription thinking it was a monthly plan it turns out it was an annual commitment and when i tried to cancel i even suggested early termination fee they said they didnt have a cancellation option thats ridiculous everything can be cancelled even with a penalty now i have to pay  months of subscription against my will stay away from loopnet and costar costar is the monsanto of commercial real estate we strongly recommend to stay away from them their sales agent noah lied to us on many occasions and refused to cancel the auto renewal plan yes we were set us up for a  year contract without being informed the sales agent evaded our many attempts to end the subscription by formulating various excuses and waste our time their service is overpriced and obsolete they claim they have an app but its full of bugs and crashes constantly loopnet offered a better alternative but has been bought by costar and since became inefficient closed and expensive costar was a waste of time and money stay away atrocious representatives and sales tactics paying for loop net coastar staff should be trained or replaced costar group deserves a negative rating not one even one star they will do whatever it take to get you to sign a contract and lock you in without any options for termination whether you use the service or not sales and management are as dishonest as they get no wonder they dont offer a free trials this was by far the biggest waste of money i have ever spent costar deserves no stars at all their tech service should be called tech nonservice i honestly wish that there was an alternative i hate monopolies i subscribed to this relative worthless group thinking i could get more exposure for my listings wrong i wanted to look for properties all over the west for my clients wrong i have a property for sale in indiana and wanted a list of brokers to contact wrong this company sucks and the masses of info they give you might be of value to an office broker but for multifamily not at all they are a waste of money and time i should give them  stars but i dont think i can costar group claimed this business has been claimed by the owner or a representative learn more  reviews details  opens a popup

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans

specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
