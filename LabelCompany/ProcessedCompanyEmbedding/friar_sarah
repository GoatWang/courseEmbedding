kcaulderwood on  at  am new relic appointed sarah friar cfo of square to its board of directors in january  photo women  httpwomencomcloudsoftwarecompanynewrelicaddssquarecfosarahfriarboard a few weeks ago sarah friar the chief financial officer of mobile payment company square was added to the board of software analytics company new relicit’s the latest in a series of career moves that has taken her from south africa to london to san francisco through the world of engineering corporate finance and finally tech startups  “not many people on the planet have the relevant highscale handson experience with finance engineering and operations that sarah has” wrote lew cirne founder and ceo of new relic in a blog post announcing her appointment he said her experiences at goldman sachs group inc nyse gs mckinsey  company salesforcecom and square have “given her a frontrow seat for the evolution of the modern software business model”but the mother of two is also passionate about another subject creating more opportunities for women in science technology engineering and math stemin an interview with international business times friar discussed the challenges for women in technology and the corporate world and her new initiative meant to inspire girls in elementary and high school to pursue careers in computing   ibtimes youve recently been appointed to new relics board of directors and robin schulman was also hired as general counsel and hilarie koplowmcadams as the chief revenue officer is it unusual for a tech company to have this many women on the board  friar clearly there is nothing preventing women from being great leaders so the lack of women in tech has to be a systemic bias which we should all be fighting to overcome it starts small and early — talking to our daughters to get them passionate and interested in science and respectful of diverse opinions and thoughts i have already heard girls in my daughter’s rd grade class say they are not good at math that is a terrible outcome at  years old ibtimes what are the disadvantages and advantages for women working in the corporate world and technology can you cite any specific examples from your own experiencefriar as a minority you are memorable when i was a tech analyst i was often the only woman in the room asking a question i knew if my question was insightful everyone would remember “sarah friar probed on that” i also knew that if it was weak or irrelevant everyone would remember that too it is good to have a high bar in life as it gives that extra adrenalin rush that we should all be craving in our professional lives   ibtimes before joining square in  you had worked at salesforcecom goldman sachs and mckinsey is there a difference in the working atmosphere at a relatively smaller company like square friar broadly speaking regardless of the overall size of an organization small teams will always move faster and be more nimble in the face of blockers mckinsey was all about small teams oriented around a single piece of work with clearly defined deliverables it was a great training ground for me at goldman equity research is also formed around small teams hyperfocused on deliverablesat square our open and transparent culture makes us truly unique for example notes from every meeting are emailed to the entire company — whether the meeting covers new product features potential partnerships or acquisition etc this even includes our board meetings we are transparent because everyone is an owner of this company and we also believe that great ideas can come from anywhere those ideas are often sparked by being knowledgeable about everything happening at square  being transparent also helps people think outside of their current role for example those in finance have opinions on our products and engineers have ideas about how to launch to market hack week which happens once per quarter at square is a great example of teams coming together around an idea they are passionate about and working outside of their daytoday job description many ideas born during hack week become the next set of disruptive products we launch to the worldibtmes women are generally considered a minority in the stem field what has made you different what drew you to technologyfriar my math teacher at school would reference the subject as a language which really resonated with me i have always been intrigued by numbers and love how seemingly very complex problems can be distilled down into logical piecesi studied metallurgy in college graduating with a masters of engineering my first internship was on a gold mine in africa the environment was not very diverse but it did set a bar of “if i can survive and thrive here then i can do anything”in  i came to silicon valley and was so excited to be part of such a vibrant community the us really does feel like a melting pot where anyone can be anything they want to be we are very lucky to have this sentiment but there is no doubt we can push to do morewhen companies look like their customers and have empathy not just sympathy they respond better in their products and services it is fun to watch our square executive team in action because we all come from different backgrounds countries and perspectives  ibtimes whats the biggest challenge for a woman working in tech todayfriar there is a lot of pressure on women and men to do it all — be successful in their career while equally supporting their partner and being a great mumdad at square we do everything we can to support parents we offer four months of paid parental leave for new mothers and fathers we also lead by example i have set a goal to attend as many major school events as possible and i also always take my kids to doctor appointments this requires planning and being very clear on prioritiesbeyond that at square empowering women also means empowering women entrepreneurs and small business owners with products that make it easy for them to start run and grow their businesses in america  percent of small businesses are led or founded by women  percent of small businesses using square are led or founded by women we are proud of our female seller community and want to do more to support themin celebration of international women’s day we are hosting an event on march  for women entrepreneurs and sellers as an opportunity for them to strengthen their livelihoods and learn from experts on topics that are pertinent to their businesses utilizing social media for marketing finance  recruiting smartly and well even when you are small and running your business by the numbers we are committed to supporting women in business inside and outside of our own teamsibtimes what gave you the idea to start code camp did you have an aha momentfriar the idea for high school code camp stemmed from a square engineer who wished a similar opportunity had been available to her — an opportunity that would have exposed her to computer science before college i’m excited that four months into high school code camp we are hearing from several young women that they are now considering computer science as a majoribtimes how has the project progressedfriar we are four months into high school code camp and the girls are meeting twice a week two hours at a time at square’s headquarters class begins with a short lecture and then they dive into handson coding work our curriculum which was created by square engineers mixes theory and practice and prepares the young women for the ap computer science exam in mayibtimes has anything surprised you yetfriar the high schoolers are asking for homeworkibtimes what advice can you give to young women looking to enter the stem fieldsfriar a diversity of thought perspective and culture is important in any field not just engineering surround yourself with people who support you and get involved in programs like high school code camp and college code camp black girls code

you need to know about sarahah the hot new anonymous messaging appsarah friar chief financial officer of square inc courtesy of business wiresquaresquare cfo sarah friar this was the right time to ipodan primacknov  square the san franciscobased company whose first product allowed merchants to take credit card payments via the iphones began trading shares this morning on the new york stock exchange after raising  million in its initial public offering the ipo itself was disappointing  with square pricing shares at  a piece compared to an  per share offering range  but the stock has popped more than  in early tradingafter squares sq initial trades fortune spent some time on the phone with sarah friar the companys chief financial officer since  what follows is an edited transcript of our conversationfortune square last night chose to price below its ipo offering range was that a difficult decision and was there any serious talk of postponementfriar ultimately we felt the time was right for the company to go public we said throughout the roadshow that the business is incredibly healthy right now and that we have a number of really big opportunities in front of us you saw the new hardware we rang the bell with were at a point in time with major changes related to emv and nfc technologies and square capital is hitting an scurve we cant time the market so we control what we can control and what was most important was to put extra funding on our balance sheetdid you get a sense from the roadshow that youd price lowwe had really good meetings i think a lot of people walked in with preconceptions about square because weve definitely been a company that has had a story told for us that isnt our story  which is why i was so happy to be able to show and not just tell when we walked out of meetings we heard consistently wow thats a completely different business from what i thought it was they didnt necessarily realize all of the things you can build on top of two million active sellers and the data at our fingertips not just from the core business but also square capital and how the services work togetherrelatedamazonthe next industry amazon could dominateamazonthe next industry amazon could dominatepeople also think of square as a payments company but we were able to show that were really a technology company with a tremendous platform for sellers that provides a cohesive experience that they cant get from anyone else were doing that via a payments model but dont mistake us for a payments companythe stock has popped substantially this morning do you regret leaving money on the tableim just so happy were back on the road to driving the business forward we put quite a lot of new capital on a balance sheet that had been healthy already  it was good to disprove naysayers by being able to show that  we repaid the credit revolver so netnet were just looking forward it took a lot of work to get here and theres more aheadyou came to square from salesforcecom crm but before that spent more than a decade at goldman sachs gs how did your investment banking experience inform your ipo decisionsi sometimes joke that from an ipo perspective ive surrounded the pin ive seen it as a banker a research analyst a director and now as a cfo and i can say that the cfo seat is definitely where the most work is done without question i think what helped most of all was just keeping true north the market is a long arc of the value you build which always goes back to square and our employees and our sellers you need to remember that this is just a pointintimewe had a lot of our sellers here at the nyse this morning and i was standing next to a woman who i had spoken to during a previous trip to new york about taking square capital and she told me she had done it then she asked me about taking it again for a different opportunity this is what it should be about focused on the business moving forwardspeaking of that business square capital currently provides merchant cash advances mcas do you have any plans to become a licensed lenderwhen we moved into this business we chose mcas as our product because we could move faster with them classic tech company strategy move fast and then quickly iterate it certainly worked since weve given out over  advances in just a yearandahalf but absolutely what we hear from sellers is that theyd like for us to take on the rest because mcas require sellers to wait until it comes to an end before getting more which doesnt always work so were thinking about that on the back end to see how we could structure it to be more like a loan investors would like that too because we basically moved this off the balance sheet and theyd like to be able to securitize it so some sort of loanlike structure on the backend with a lending license but still matching working capital and knowing the fixed fee youre going to pay theres a lot of magic to makewe at fortune have focused a lot on how squares ipo price affects its early investors how does it affect employeeson a mega level one really important tenet of square is that were all owners every employee has equity which im very proud of so i really care that the stock will show the value created over time it impacts peoples ability to send their kid to college or buy a house  all because of what we built togetherthe message i sent to the team last night was to first take a breath and celebrate not many companies get to this stage even though it may feel like they do then keep focusing on making life for sellers magical and the market will pay us for that dont gauge the impact youre having by the stock price from one hour to the nextgoogle blocked its employees from checking stock prices on the day of its ipo
