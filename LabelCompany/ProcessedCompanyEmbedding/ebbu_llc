takes a natural product cannabis and transforms it into something which is predictable meaning you know how it will make you feel before you try it and reliable meaning the sensation is the same every time just like you dont call a bottle of vodka potato juice we dont consider ebbu products marijuana cannabis is just the raw material from which ebbu makes its productsebbu was founded in early  by
