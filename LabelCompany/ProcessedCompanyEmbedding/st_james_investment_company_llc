investment research seeks to determine the appraised value of a company investments are then made at a significant discount ideally  to  below the company’s current intrinsic value this approach allows us to buy companies with a sufficient margin of safety as valuations are imprecise and the future is unpredictable emphasis on risk defining risk as the permanent loss of capital we believe that the quality of investment decisions is far more important that the quantity of investment decisions our process demands that we not trade stocks but rather consider businesses we would like and purchase and hold for  to  years we therefore mitigate risk via a thorough examination and understanding of each business we fractionally own willingness to hold cash patience is necessary in the absence of obvious bargains as entry price is a significant determinant of return as great ideas are often scarce it can take a long time for the market to present truly compelling opportunities that coincide with our circle of competence as a result we are content to hold cash until our patience is rewarded the stock market is filled with individuals who know the price of everything but the value
