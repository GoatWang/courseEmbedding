approximately  million in selling general and administrative expenses for costs incurred related to the pending revlon merger see note  to the notes to consolidated financial statements  performance improvement plan and  business transformation program during fiscal  we began a comprehensive review of our entire business model and cost structure to identify initiatives to reduce the size and complexity of our overhead structure and to exit lowreturn businesses customers and brands in order to improve gross margins and profitability in the long term as a result of this review we implemented several restructuring and cost savings initiatives at the end of fiscal  and during fiscal  that we refer to as the  performance improvement plan during fiscal  and  we incurred a total of approximately  million of pretax charges under the  performance improvement plan all charges associated with the  performance improvement plan had been recorded as of june   as we continued to look for ways of improving our business and financial performance and achieving our targeted goal of  to  million in annualized savings during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we identified certain additional restructuring and cost savings initiatives that we implemented during fiscal  with some remaining pretax charges to be incurred in fiscal  we collectively refer to these initiatives as our  business transformation program the  business transformation program was intended to further align our organizational structure and distribution arrangements with the current needs and demands of our business in order to improve our gotomarket capability and execution and to streamline our organization we expect to incur approximately  million to  million in pretax charges under the  business transformation program of which an estimated  million to  million is expected to be comprised of cash expenditures during the fiscal year ended june   we incurred approximately  million of pretax charges under the  business transformation program and since inception we have incurred approximately  million of pretax charges for further discussion see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note  to the notes to consolidated financial statements we currently expect that the actions and initiatives identified and executed under the  performance improvement plan and the  business transformation program will result in approximately  million of annualized savings exceeding the top end of our originally targeted range of annualized savings if the revlon merger is not completed we may pursue additional cost savings initiatives to further improve our business and financial performance these efforts may result in additional decisions that may impact net sales operating margins andor earnings in future periods the specific facts and circumstances surrounding any such future decisions will impact the timing and amount of any costs or expenses that may be incurred investment by rh�ne capital llc affiliates on august   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with nightingale onshore holdings lp and nightingale

with topic  consolidation in addition based on the terms of a putcall agreement with the other equity member of us cosmeceutechs llc we are required to classify the noncontrolling interest in usc as a redeemable noncontrolling interest in the mezzanine section of our consolidated balance sheet see note  to the notes to consolidated financial statements during fiscal  through a subsidiary we entered into a joint venture in the united arab emirates the uae joint venture with an unrelated third party for the sale promotion and distribution of our fragrance skincare and cosmetics products primarily in middle eastern countries effective september   we entered into a similar joint venture for the southeast asia region and effective january   in hong kong the southeast asia joint venture with an unrelated third party for the sale promotion and distribution of certain of our fragrance skincare and cosmetics products in southeast asia see note  to the notes to consolidated financial statements based on our equity interests and controlling rights in the joint ventures we have determined that the uae joint venture and the southeast asia joint venture are each vies requiring consolidation of such joint ventures financial statements in accordance with topic  consolidation the respective unrelated third partys interest in each joint venture is classified as a noncontrolling interest in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheet during fiscal  we acquired the us and international trademarks for the giorgio of beverly hills fragrance brands from the procter  gamble company and certain of its affiliates for  million prior to the acquisition of the trademarks we manufactured and sold the giorgio beverly hills fragrances under a license agreement with the procter  gamble company and certain of its affiliates in july  we acquired the global license and certain assets related to the christina aguilera fragrance business from procter  gamble international operations sa for approximately  million critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in those consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors that we believe are most likely to occur changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates which are recorded in the period in which they become known actual results could differ from those estimates if these changes result in a material impact to the consolidated financial statements their impact is disclosed in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations andor in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the disclosures below also note situations in which it is reasonably likely that future financial results could be affected by changes in these estimates and assumptions the term reasonably likely refers to an occurrence that is more than remote but less than probable in the judgment of management our most critical accounting policies and estimates are described in detail below see note  to the notes to consolidated financial statements  general information and summary of significant accounting policies for a discussion of these and other accounting policies accounting for acquisitions and intangible assets under the accounting for business combinations consideration paid in an acquisition is allocated to the underlying assets and liabilities based on their respective estimated fair values the excess of the consideration paid at the acquisition date over the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired or liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly affect net income for example different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ and the useful life of property plant and equipment acquired will differ substantially from the useful life of brand licenses and trademarks consequently to the extent a longerlived asset is ascribed greater value under the purchase method than a shorterlived asset net income in a given period may be higher determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions one area that requires more judgment is determining the fair value and useful lives of intangible assets because the fair value and the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is a subjective estimate it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change for example if we discontinue or experience a decline in the profitability of one or more of our brands the value of the intangible assets associated with those brands or their useful lives may decline or certain intangible assets such as the elizabeth arden brand trademarks may no longer be classified as an indefinitelived asset which could result in additional charges to net income image removed logo    table of contents we follow the guidance in topic  intangiblesgoodwill and other which simplifies how an entity assesses goodwill for impairment and allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment assessment an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines based on a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount should a goodwill impairment assessment be necessary there is a two step process for assessing impairment of goodwill the first step used to identify potential impairment compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill the second step if necessary measures the amount of the impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the goodwill and intangible assets to their respective carrying values if an impairment is identified the carrying value of the asset is adjusted to estimated fair value see note  to the notes to consolidated financial statements we also follow the guidance in topic  for testing impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets other than goodwill examples of intangible assets subject to the guidance include indefinitelived trademarks licenses and distribution rights companies are given the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test a company electing to perform a qualitative assessment is not required to calculate the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset unless the company determines based on such qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired our intangible assets consist of exclusive brand licenses trademarks patents and other intellectual property customer relationships and lists noncompete agreements and goodwill the value of these assets is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends we have determined that the elizabeth arden trademarks have indefinite useful lives as cash flows from the use of the trademarks are expected to be generated indefinitely goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives such as our elizabeth arden trademarks are not amortized but rather assessed for impairment at least annually we typically perform our annual impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not fully be recoverable during the quarter ended june   we completed our annual impairment assessment of the elizabeth arden trademarks with the assistance of a third party valuation firm in assessing the fair value of these trademarks we considered the income approach under the income approach the fair value is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows the analysis and assessments of these assets and goodwill indicated that no impairment adjustment was required as the estimated fair value exceeded the recorded carrying value a hypothetical  decrease to the fair value of our elizabeth arden trademarks or a hypothetical  increase in the discount rate used to estimate fair value would not result in an impairment of our elizabeth arden trademarks during the quarter ended june   we also completed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill using the guidance in topic  the analysis indicated that no impairment adjustment was required a hypothetical  decrease in the fair value of our north america reporting unit would not result in an impairment of our goodwill during the second quarter of fiscal  as net sales of justin bieber and nicki minaj fragrances continued to fall significantly below expectations we reviewed these license agreements for potential impairment given the significant decline in net sales under these brands during the first half of fiscal  and the expectation for a continued decline of sales under these brands in future periods we determined that these intangible assets were fully impaired as a result we recorded a total impairment charge of approximately  million in the second quarter of fiscal  to write off the carrying values of both the justin bieber and nicki minaj licenses see note  to the notes to consolidated financial statements during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we decided i not to renew the true religion license agreement which expired on june   and ii not to renew the bcbgmaxazria license agreement once it expires in january  at the time of the acquisition of the licenses from new wave fragrances llc in may  we assumed we would exercise the renewal options for both licenses and estimated the useful lives to be approximately six years for the true religion license and  years for the bcbgmaxazria license the decision not to exercise the renewal options for both licenses triggered an impairment analysis for each license as a result we recorded an impairment charge of  million during the fourth quarter of fiscal  to reduce the carrying values for both the true religion and bcbgmaxazria licenses see note  to the notes to consolidated financial statements determining future undiscounted cash flows is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including net sales projections operating margins and future market conditions among others we believe our assumptions are reasonable however there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions will prove to be accurate predictions of the future we will continue to monitor and evaluate the expected future cash flows of our reporting units and the longterm trends of our market capitalization for the purposes of assessing the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinitelived elizabeth arden trademarks other trademarks and intangible assets if market and economic conditions deteriorate this could increase the likelihood of future material noncash impairment charges to our results of operations related to our goodwill indefinitelived elizabeth arden trademarks or other trademarks and intangible assets image removed logo    table of contents depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight line method periodically we review the lives assigned to our longlived assets and adjust the lives as circumstances dictate because estimated useful life is a subjective estimate it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change for example if we experience significant declines in net sales in certain channels of distribution it could affect the estimated useful life of certain of our longlived assets such as counters or trade fixtures which could result in additional charges to net income longlived assets we review for the impairment of longlived assets to be held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset group compared to its carrying value an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value because the fair value is a subjective estimate it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change the same circumstances that could affect the estimated useful life of a longlived asset as discussed above could cause us to change our estimate of the fair value of that asset which could result in additional charges to net income we did not record any adjustments to our longlived assets in fiscal   or  longlived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell revenue recognition sales are recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the resulting receivable is probable sales are recorded net of estimated returns markdowns and other allowances the provision for sales returns and markdowns represents managements estimate of future returns and markdowns based on historical experience and considering current external factors and market conditions allowances for sales returns and markdowns as is customary in the prestige beauty business we grant certain of our customers primarily north american prestige retailers and specialty beauty stores subject to our authorization and approval the right to either return product for credit against amounts previously billed or to receive a markdown allowance upon sale to such customers we record a provision for product returns and markdowns estimated based on our level of sales historical and projected experience with product returns and markdowns in each of our business segments and with respect to each of our product types current economic trends and changes in customer demand and customer mix we make detailed estimates at the segment product and customer level which are then aggregated to arrive at a consolidated provision for product returns and markdowns and are reviewed periodically as facts and circumstances warrant such provisions and markdown allowances are recorded as a reduction of net sales because there is considerable judgment used in evaluating the allowance for returns and markdowns it is reasonably likely that actual experience will differ from our estimates if for example customer demand for our products is lower than estimated or a proportionately greater amount of sales is made to prestige retailers andor specialty beauty stores additional provisions for returns or markdowns may be required resulting in a charge to income in the period in which the determination was made similarly if customer demand for our products is higher than estimated a reduction of our provision for returns or markdowns may be required resulting in an increase to income in the period in which the determination was made as a percentage of gross sales our returns and markdowns were   and  for the fiscal years ended june    and  respectively a hypothetical  change in the value of our allowance for sales returns and markdowns as of june   would result in a  million change to net income allowances for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover uncollectible accounts receivable and we evaluate our accounts receivable to determine if they will ultimately be collected this evaluation includes significant judgments and estimates including an analysis of receivables aging and a customerbycustomer review for large accounts it is reasonably likely that actual experience will differ from our estimates which may result in an increase or decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts if for example the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay additional allowances may be required resulting in a charge to income in the period in which the determination was made a hypothetical  change in the value of our allowance for doubtful    aug   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch more coverage all the

and considerations acquisitionintegration  the company actively evaluates potential acquisitions as part of its growth strategy acquisitions pursued by the company could be dilutive to financial results and result in a difficult dilutive or expensive integration acquisitionintegration  the company recently completed acquisitions if the company fails to successfully integrate the acquisition the deal may lead to disappointing returns commodity costs  should commodity prices for the companys resources increase the companys operating margins could be harmed competition  the industry is highly competitive and many of the companys competitors have greater resources currency exposure  since the company purchases its finished goods from foreign manufacturers and sell its products in transactions denominated in us dollars a weakening of the us dollar could negatively impact the company cyclical nature of the companys business  revenue from the companys businesses have historically correlated positively with both us and world gdp a cyclical downturn in gdp growth domestically andor abroad may lead to a material deterioration in the companys results discretionary spending  the products the company sells are largely discretionary in nature and any slowdown in consumer spending would have an unfavorable impact on the company economy  macroeconomic issues such as increasing oil and gas prices and a possible drop in consumer spending could have a negative impact on the companys business execution  management may not execute well on its restructuring efforts as it allocates capital and human resources towards acquisitions and related integration possibly resulting in lower margins and cash flow financial results  due to the companys relatively small revenue base and fixed operating cost structure the loss or delay of one large license deal or services contract could significantly impact the bottom line financial results  unpredictable timing of customer orders freight costs  increases in freight costs caused by high gasoline prices or other factors could cause margin erosion or lost market share if the company raises prices growth plan  there are many factors that may impact the companys ability to achieve its stated growth objectives international operations  the company derives a significant portion of its revenues from outside the united states the company is subject to foreign exchange risk and the risks inherent in managing a global company license agreement expiration  stores that the company operates within may choose not to extend their license agreements upon maturity which could significantly impact revenues and financial results loss of key personnel  in our opinion the current management team will be instrumental in executing the companys growth strategy the resignation of a key member of management would have a negative impact on the company pricing pressure  the companys business could be affected by pricing pressure within the market seasonality  the companys results are highly seasonal general industry  the company could miss our estimates andor their financial guidance further potential risks  see the
