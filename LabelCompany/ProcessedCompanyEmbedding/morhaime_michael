generally saying a given product is done when its done pax imperia ii was originally announced as a title to be published by blizzard blizzard eventually dropped pax imperia ii though when it decided it might be in conflict with their other space strategy project which became known as starcraft thq eventually contracted with heliotrope and released the game in  as pax imperia eminent domain technologyedit warden clientedit blizzard has made use of a special form of software known as the warden client the warden client is known to be used with blizzards online games such as diablo and world of warcraft and the terms of service contain a clause consenting to the warden softwares ram scans while a blizzard game is running the warden client scans a small portion of the code segment of running processes in order to determine whether any thirdparty programs are running the goal of this is to detect and address players who may be attempting to run unsigned code or third party programs in the game this determination of third party programs is made by hashing the scanned strings and comparing the hashed value to a list of hashes assumed to correspond to banned third party programs the wardens reliability in correctly discerning legitimate versus illegitimate actions was called into question when a large scale incident happened this incident banned many linux users after an update to warden caused it to incorrectly detect cedega as a cheat program blizzard issued a statement claiming they had correctly identified and restored all accounts and credited them with  days play warden scans all processes running on a computer not just the game and could possibly run across what would be considered private information and other personally identifiable information it is because of these peripheral scans that warden has been accused of being spyware and has run afoul of controversy among privacy advocates battlenet edit main article battlenet blizzard released its revamped battlenet service in  this service allows people who have purchased blizzard products starcraft starcraft ii diablo ii and warcraft iii as well as their expansions to download digital copies of games they have purchased without needing any physical media on november   blizzard required all world of warcraft accounts to switch over to battlenet accounts this transition means that all current blizzard titles can be accessed downloaded and played with a singular battlenet login battlenet  is the platform for matchmaking service for blizzard games which offers players a host of additional features players are able to track their friends achievements view match history avatars etc players are able to unlock a wide range of achievements rewards for completing game content for blizzard games the service allows players to chat simultaneously with players from other blizzard games for example players no longer need to create multiple user names or accounts for most blizzard products to enable cross game communication players need to become either battletag or real id friendscitation needed privacy controversy and real idedit on july   blizzard announced that they were changing the way their forums worked to require that users identify themselves with their real name the reaction from the community was overwhelmingly negative with multiple game magazines calling the change foolhardy and an epic fail it resulted in a significant user response on the blizzard forums including one thread on the issue reaching over  replies this included personal details of a blizzard employee who gave his real name to show it wasnt a big deal shortly after revealing his real name forum users posted personal information including his phone number picture age and home address some technology media outlets suggested that displaying real names through real id is a good idea and would benefit both battlenet and the blizzard community but others were worried that blizzard were opening their fans up to reallife dangers such as stalking harassment and employment issues since a simple internet search by someones employer can reveal their online activities blizzard initially responded to some of the concerns by saying that the changes would not be retroactive to previous posts that parents could set up the system so that minors cannot post and that posting to the forums is optional however due to the huge negative response blizzard president michael morhaime issued a statement rescinding the plan to use real names on blizzards forums for the time being apart from the negative side effects of real id relating to privacy the addition boasts features for current blizzard titles for instance real names for friends crossrealm and crossgame

declining to set release dates choosing to instead take as much time as needed generally saying a given product is done when its done pax imperia ii was originally announced as a title to be published by blizzard blizzard eventually dropped pax imperia ii though when it decided it might be in conflict with their other space strategy project which became known as starcraft thq eventually contracted with heliotrope and released the game in  as pax imperia eminent domain technologyedit warden clientedit blizzard has made use of a special form of software known as the warden client the warden client is known to be used with blizzards online games such as diablo and world of warcraft and the terms of service contain a clause consenting to the warden softwares ram scans while a blizzard game is running the warden client scans a small portion of the code segment of running processes in order to determine whether any thirdparty programs are running the goal of this is to detect and address players who may be attempting to run unsigned code or third party programs in the game this determination of third party programs is made by hashing the scanned strings and comparing the hashed value to a list of hashes assumed to correspond to banned third party programs the wardens reliability in correctly discerning legitimate versus illegitimate actions was called into question when a large scale incident happened this incident banned many linux users after an update to warden caused it to incorrectly detect cedega as a cheat program blizzard issued a statement claiming they had correctly identified and restored all accounts and credited them with  days play warden scans all processes running on a computer not just the game and could possibly run across what would be considered private information and other personally identifiable information it is because of these peripheral scans that warden has been accused of being spyware and has run afoul of controversy among privacy advocates battlenet edit main article battlenet blizzard released its revamped battlenet service in  this service allows people who have purchased blizzard products starcraft starcraft ii diablo ii and warcraft iii as well as their expansions to download digital copies of games they have purchased without needing any physical media on november   blizzard required all world of

able to unlock a wide range of achievements rewards for completing game content for blizzard games the service allows players to chat simultaneously with players from other blizzard games for example players no longer need to create multiple user names or accounts for most blizzard products to enable cross game communication players need to become either battletag or real id friendscitation needed privacy controversy and real idedit on july   blizzard announced that they were changing the way their forums worked to require that users identify themselves with their real name the reaction from the community was overwhelmingly negative with multiple game magazines calling the change foolhardy and an epic fail it resulted in a significant user response on the blizzard forums including one thread on the issue reaching over  replies this included personal details of a blizzard employee who gave his real name to show it wasnt a big deal shortly after revealing his real name forum users posted personal information including his phone number picture age and home address some technology media outlets suggested that displaying real names through real id is a good idea and would benefit both battlenet and the blizzard community but others were worried that blizzard were opening their fans up to reallife dangers such as stalking harassment and employment issues since a simple internet search by someones employer can reveal their online activities blizzard initially responded to some of the concerns by saying that the changes would not be retroactive to previous posts that parents could set up the system so that minors cannot post and that posting to the forums is optional however due to the huge negative response blizzard president michael morhaime issued a statement rescinding the plan to use real names on blizzards forums for the time being apart from the negative side effects of real id relating to privacy the addition boasts features for current blizzard titles for instance real names for friends crossrealm and crossgame chat rich presence and broadcasts are included with the real id system legal disputesedit starcraft privacy lawsuitedit in  donald p

privacy controversy and real idedit on july   blizzard announced that they were changing the way their forums worked to require that users identify themselves with their real name the reaction from the community was overwhelmingly negative with multiple game magazines calling the change foolhardy and an epic fail it resulted in a significant user response on the blizzard forums including one thread on the issue reaching over  replies this included personal details of a blizzard employee who gave his real name to show it wasnt a big deal shortly after revealing his real name forum users posted personal information including his phone number picture age and home address some technology media outlets suggested that displaying real names through real id is a good idea and would benefit both battlenet and the blizzard community but others were worried that blizzard were opening their fans up to reallife dangers such as stalking harassment and employment issues since a simple internet search by someones employer can reveal their online activities blizzard initially responded to some of the concerns by saying that the changes would not be retroactive to previous posts that parents could set up the system so that minors cannot post and that posting to the forums is optional however due to the huge negative response blizzard president michael morhaime issued a statement rescinding the plan to use real names on blizzards forums for the time being apart from the negative side effects of real id relating to privacy the addition boasts features for current blizzard

is running the warden client scans a small portion of the code segment of running processes in order to determine whether any thirdparty programs are running the goal of this is to detect and address players who may be attempting to run unsigned code or third party programs in the game this determination of third party programs is made by hashing the scanned strings and comparing the hashed value to a list of hashes assumed to correspond to banned third party programs the wardens reliability in correctly discerning legitimate versus illegitimate actions was called into question when a large scale incident happened this incident banned many linux users after an update to warden caused it to incorrectly detect cedega as a cheat program blizzard issued a statement claiming they had correctly identified and restored all accounts and credited them with  days play warden scans all processes running on a computer not just the game and could possibly run across what would be

development hell for much of its lifespan after seven years of development blizzard revealed the cancellation of an unannounced mmo codenamed titan on september   the company also has a history of declining to set release dates choosing to instead take as much time as needed generally saying a given product is done when its done pax imperia ii was originally announced as a title to be published by blizzard blizzard eventually dropped pax imperia ii though when it decided it might be in conflict with their other space strategy project which became known as starcraft thq eventually contracted with heliotrope and released the game in  as pax imperia eminent domain technologyedit warden clientedit blizzard has made use of a special form of software known as the warden client the warden client is known to be used with blizzards online games such as diablo and world of warcraft and the terms of service contain a clause consenting to the warden softwares ram scans while a blizzard game is running the warden client scans a small portion of the code segment of running processes in order to determine whether any thirdparty programs are running the goal of this is to detect and address players who may be attempting to run unsigned code or third party programs in the game this determination of third party programs is made by hashing the scanned strings and comparing the hashed value to a list of hashes assumed to correspond to banned third party programs the wardens reliability in correctly discerning legitimate versus illegitimate actions was called into question when a large scale incident happened this incident banned many linux users after an update to warden caused it to incorrectly detect cedega as a cheat program blizzard issued a statement claiming they had correctly identified and restored all accounts and credited them with  days play warden scans all processes running on a computer not just the game and could possibly run across what would be considered private information and other personally identifiable information it is because of these peripheral scans that warden has been accused of being spyware and has run afoul of controversy among privacy advocates battlenet edit main article battlenet blizzard released its revamped battlenet service in  this service allows people who have purchased blizzard products starcraft starcraft ii diablo ii and warcraft iii as well as their expansions to download digital copies of games they have purchased without needing any physical media on november   blizzard required all world of warcraft accounts to switch over to battlenet accounts this transition means that all current blizzard titles can be accessed downloaded and played with a singular battlenet login battlenet  is the platform for matchmaking service for blizzard games which offers players a host of additional features players are able to track their friends achievements view match history avatars etc players are able to unlock a wide range of achievements rewards for completing game content for blizzard games the service allows players to chat simultaneously with players from other blizzard games for example players no longer need to create multiple user names or accounts for most blizzard products to enable cross game communication players need to become either battletag or real id friendscitation needed privacy controversy and real idedit on july   blizzard announced that they were changing the way their forums worked to require that users identify themselves with their real name the reaction from the community was overwhelmingly negative with multiple game magazines calling the change foolhardy and an epic fail it resulted in a significant user response on the blizzard forums including one thread on the issue reaching over  replies this included personal details of a blizzard employee who gave his real name to show it wasnt a big deal shortly after revealing his real name forum users posted personal information including his phone number picture age and home address some technology media outlets suggested that displaying real names through real id is a good idea and would benefit both battlenet and the blizzard community but others were worried that blizzard were opening their fans up to reallife dangers such as stalking harassment and employment issues since a simple internet search by someones employer can reveal their online activities blizzard initially responded to some of the concerns by saying that the changes would not be retroactive to previous posts that parents could set up the system so that minors cannot post and that posting to the forums is optional however due to the huge negative response blizzard president michael morhaime issued a statement rescinding the plan to use real names on blizzards forums for the time being apart from the negative side effects of real id relating to privacy the addition boasts features for current blizzard titles for instance real names for friends crossrealm and crossgame chat rich presence and broadcasts are included with the real id system legal disputesedit starcraft privacy lawsuitedit in  donald p

games  by dean takahashi games exclusive blizzard ceo mike morhaime on the last  years of games — and the next  dean takahashideantak february    am above the early blizzard team then known as silicon  synapse with allen adham in the striped shirt and mike morhaime on the far right frank pearce is on the far leftimage credit blizzard blizzard entertainment is the the division of activision blizzard that’s brought us games like starcraft diablo and world of warcraft and it turns  today its chief executive is mike morhaime who was one of the three original founders who started the company during the golden age of pc games the company started in  as silicon  synapse with allen adham morhaime and frank pearce as its founders they started out as work for hire making games for interplay productions but now they’ve grown into a employee powerhouse with  billion in the  months that ended september  the leading subscriber online game in world of warcraft a  million seller in diablo iii and two growing esports with hearthstone heroes of warcraft a card battler and heroes of the storm an online multiplayer strategy game throughout the ups and downs the changes in ownership a transition in power in which adham turned the reins over to morhaime the company has outlived the competition and morhaime has seen it all gamesbeat interviewed morhaime last week to catch up on  years of history and blizzard’s outlook for the future we did a joint interview with me and gamesbeat contributing writers heather newman and kevin hovdestad heather in fact asked most of the questions we talked about the creation of blizzard how it got its final name the transition to ceo back in  how blizzard handles game cancellations and perhaps most important how blizzard developed and held to its focus on making quality games for gamers and we also talked about blizzard’s future the emergence of esports and the importance of diversity here’s an edited transcript of our interview above mike morhaime cofounder of blizzard then chaos studios in image credit blizzard mike morhaime i was looking at a story in the la times back in  with allen adham right after we announced the davidson acquisition that might have been our first interview with dean takahashi gamesbeat i think so i’m looking at that story now too it was such a small deal at the time  million morhaime it seemed big at the time but what’s kind of cool is that you both look exactly the same gamesbeat if you could quickly summarize what you remember now about how you guys got started how you met each other i know it was in college it was you allen and frank right what stands out for you now about getting together with them morhaime we had two classes together i was studying electrical engineering and he was computer science and engineering my last year at ucla there was this quarter we had two classes together and we became really good friends i didn’t meet frank until the first day when we opened the company frank and allen were friends from school they might have had some classes together used to go to the arcade together allen viewed frank as a passionate gamer he was also a computer science and engineering major allen was the instigator he recruited me to leave my job at western digital and frank to leave his job at rockwell allen also had a couple of other friends that were still in school we subcontracted them to do some work he lined up some work with interplay and we opened the doors interplay hired us to do some ports of their games to the mac or the amiga we did the amiga version of lord of the rings that was a game interplay put out on the pc that was probably the first project i remember working on frank did most of the work on that allen and i just pitched in occasionally gamesbeat i remember playing and writing about that game the pc version morhaime we all did some of the work on it i wrote some utilities to convert the artwork so that it would display on the amiga it’s funny there was one piece of art that was somehow missing from what interplay gave us the ring itself frank actually had to draw the ring above mike morhaime ceo of blizzard entertainment in image credit flickr creative commons sobcontrollers gamesbeat it’s the same way people get in the industry today morhaime probably back then you had pc as the main gaming platform and then these other platforms that big companies like interplay would hire little developers to do conversions for nowadays it’s probably the mobile platforms that are creating a lot of opportunities for small developers with a very small team you can create compelling content and reach a large audience gamesbeat the thing that sticks in my head from that time was allen saying “we like making games that make your palms sweaty” morhaime laughs our first console game was rpm racing we started and released that project in that same year we founded the company  it managed to get on shelves by the holidays that was also published by interplay and then the sequel was rock ‘n’ roll racing which is a much better game that we did a few years later gamesbeat what do you recall about striking out on your own leaving the interplay work behind morhaime chaos was really just a name change it didn’t signify much although right after we changed the name we sold the company to davidson and associates and changed the name to blizzard even before you get there we were doing original development of console games you had lost vikings and blackthorne and rock ‘n’ roll racing justice league task force lost vikings and rock ‘n’ roll racing were pretty critical games to us we got some acclaim as a result some video gaming awards those are the games that impressed davidson and associates and led to the merger talks in february of  that’s when we sold the company to davidson changed our name to blizzard and started working on warcraft gamesbeat where did the blizzard name come from morhaime we had such a hard time finding a name that everyone liked and wasn’t already a registered trademark from somebody the main reason we changed the name from chaos was because someone was already using the name chaos technologies we went back to the drawing board brainstormed a bunch of stuff allen got attached to the name ogre for a little bit of time it was going to be ogre studios but we were already part of davidson and associates and jan davidson hated the name ogre she didn’t like the way that would sound to her shareholders who thought they were investing in an educational software company and now they’ve got this thing called ogre she’s like “can you guys please pick something else” i think allen just started going through the dictionary he came up with blizzard and we all loved it it’s just a coolsounding name some of the other names—i think midnight studios was one i’m not sure what else but blizzard floated to the top it came up pretty clean when we did the trademark search i’m happy we landed on that above mike morhaime cofounder of chaos which later became blizzardimage credit blizzard gamesbeat how did you distinguish your roles as you moved onward and upward between you and allen and frank morhaime all three of us were programmers allen was our visionary leader lead designer lead business guy i was a support programmer production lead it and operations all the nondevelopment stuff came to me keeping everybody’s computers working we didn’t even have a network then we were just passing around floppy discs but if we needed computers i’d go to micro center or order equipment and get it all set up we didn’t have an it department it was just me frank was coding and he also did double duty as a receptionist sort of his desk was near the front door if the phone rang it was frank’s job to answer it gamesbeat what led to warcraft becoming your first project as blizzard morhaime we’d probably just come back from ces or something where we saw dune ii and thought “wow this is really cool” or maybe they’d just released dune ii i don’t remember but we got really enamored of realtime strategy dune ii was just a singleplayer game but we realized that a game like that where you could play against another person would be so cool so much fun we all loved fantasy so we set it in a fantasy universe it didn’t take a lot of selling the idea we all immediately felt like that could be something special gamesbeat this gets into much later but i was wondering where you guys picked up the ethic taking such a hardline focus on quality — shipping games only when they’re done killing an awful lot of games that you never even announced that distinguishes blizzard today how far back does that go morhaime there’s a bunch of key moments that reinforced how important quality was when we were faced with decisions there’s always intense pressure to be done on schedule “if we don’t get this thing out by this date so and so magazine won’t be able to put us on the cover” there’s always pressure to do that thankfully allen was singularly focused on making sure that we fixed the issues with the product and made as good as a product as possible if we knew there were problems we needed to fix them before we released it wasn’t about those opportunities because additional opportunities will always come along the very first time we were faced with an issue like that was with lost vikings we’d been working on the game and the team felt like we were pretty much done we’d completed all the levels and finished everything brian fargo at the time played everything interplay put out he took the game home and played through all the levels and had a bunch of notes and feedback for us he thought the levels were too difficult he thought the vikings looked too similar they were all drawn from the same palette on the super nintendo he wanted us to redraw them do an art pass we didn’t really have the resources to do that so he offered some interplay resources to do it as a developer you’re so attached to what you’ve created my first reaction was “what it’s fine the way it is it’s not too hard we’ve been playing it it’s not too hard” but allen had a very different attitude he said “brian’s right he’s right about all of this stuff” we took the time and addressed his issues we made the levels easier so it wasn’t as frustrating we let one of their artists come in to redo the viking art we wound up with a much much better game going through that process and seeing where the game was before and how much better it became as a result of that additional effort was a huge lesson to us we carried that forward always getting that feedback from people who weren’t inside the development team but knew how to make games was incredibly valuable addressing that feedback and going through an iterative process especially toward the end of development could really move the meter in terms of quality we’ve done that on every game since gamesbeat one thing i’ve noticed as you’ve moved through your later titles is not only maintaining that high level of quality but also putting together games that appeal to an audience that’s as broad as possible and sometimes in genres that were pretty hardcore before you got there world of warcraft if you compare it to the difficulty of playing everquest or hearthstone compared to other ccgs was that a deliberate strategy as you moved forward do you feel like there are still genres to work on like that – hardcore experiences that can be made more friendly for a mass audience morhaime we do always approach our games from a standpoint of—we’re trying to make these games for everyone even if they’re not already familiar with a genre and especially if they’re not already an expert at the genre we want anybody to be able to play a blizzard game and have the tools they need to enjoy it we apply that to everything we do it’s part of our values – easy to learn difficult to master having something that is easy to learn doesn’t mean that it doesn’t have depth it can still have depth you just don’t have to throw all the depth at the player when they first sit down above heroes of the storm updates are now on thescore esports appimage credit blizzard entertainment gamesbeat do you feel like any genres are particularly ripe for that at this point morhaime i’m sure there are right now our next big launch is going to be overwatch that’s certainly not a niche genre but our game is a little bit different we’re going after the teambased multiplayer fps there’s not a lot of games focused on that right now we’re trying to make it something that’s as accessible and enjoyable for everyone no matter your skill level it’s opened it up for people like me who aren’t that good at fps normally i have a great time playing overwatch gamesbeat when you took over and allen left what kind of adjustment was that for you it always seemed like he was the more outgoing one you were more in the background what did it mean to be the guy in front moving into public view morhaime there’s a few different ways to answer that question one is when allen stepped down as president of blizzard he didn’t disappear right away he continued to be very involved he was able to focus more on development for a little while he was very involved in the early days of world of warcraft it was more of a transitional phase in terms of allen’s involvement my role did change though i became the main point of contact with our parent company with the sales organization for several years after allen’s departure though i did continue to be very involved in development i continued programming and everything there was a point after warcraft iii where i had to give up programming and focus on running the business making sure that everything was going well across the whole company i definitely miss those programming days gamesbeat what do you think is going to be different about the next  years of blizzard’s growth and development compared to the last  years do you see changes coming morhaime there are always changes in gaming it’s an exciting time to be a gamer i’m excited that we have these great gaming platforms – pc console mobile it seems like gaming is becoming more and more of a mainstream activity which i’m very excited about we’ve watched esports grow from being something that for us really started out being popular in korea—we saw that explode with starcraft we always believed that esports would eventually grow in popularity everywhere in the last couple of years we’ve gotten to see that happen things like our heroes of the storm tournament being broadcast live on espn last year we’re continuing the partnership this year with another heroes of the storm tournament we’ve started to see broadcasters publishers tournament organizers everyone start to take notice of the explosion of esports i’m excited about the warcraft movie coming this summer that’s been a long time in the making it’s finally here this year that’s a big milestone gamesbeat i’m sure a lot of people up there have their fingers crossed to see more movies coming down the pipe after that one morhaime nothing could make me happier gamesbeat if there was one thing that blizzard as a company could change or affect in the video game industry over the next  or  years what would you want it to be morhaime right now people still aren’t very nice to each other online as a general rule if we can help to make the interactions between folks online safer and more friendly that would make it all more fun and more gratifying for everyone above starcraft ii legacy of the voidimage credit blizzard entertainment gamesbeat what’s interesting is you’re the second person to say that to me today maybe there’s a groundswell coming morhaime one solution is “oh let’s just not let anybody talk to each other because they might upset each other” gamesbeat the hearthstone solution morhaime well yeah for certain games like hearthstone that works great but i also thing that you want to be able to go online and interact with people you don’t know you want to create meaningful connections sometimes with people you don’t know some of the greatest stories i’ve heard come from people who met playing world of warcraft whether it’s guildmates who became friends or people who met their significant others online i want to see that type of connection continue as well we’re going to do our best gamesbeat do you think there are trends in the industry itself that are going to force you to change the way you do business certainly this concept of players being along for the ride with you in a more unified way during testing and the prelaunch period has become more of a fact of doing business do you see things like that things that will change your development process morhaime we’ve been making a strong effort at blizzard to partner with our community along the way to keep them better informed about our plans for our games especially after a game gets released i feel like it’s no longer just blizzard’s game we become a sort of curator for this experience that has millions of stakeholders who all care deeply about how the experience evolves by including our community in the process of determining how these games evolve and how we solve gamerelated issues we get to better solutions we create a sense of partnership with our community along the way gamesbeat do you see that evolving in a significant way over the next few years morhaime it’s a work in progress there’s been a proactive effort on the part of our development teams to handle this in different ways on the starcraft ii team david kim has been sending out a weekly blog post that started during the legacy of the void beta talking about the state of balance in the game that’s continued postlaunch it’s created a healthy dialogue around potential solutions and potential balance changes we might make if you look at the overwatch team jeff kaplan has been doing a video blog talking about the state of the game as we proceed during the phases of beta our players like the increased transparency that’s provided gamesbeat you talked a bit about your affection of the number of platforms we have to choose from now between pc and console and mobile is vr an area you’re interested in going into morhaime we’re very interested in vr it’s a cool technology there are still big challenges in terms of making that into something that can have massmarket acceptance at this point we’re probably in a mode to watch very closely and see how we can apply that technology to blizzard games or experiences i don’t have any plans to announce at this point it’s exciting but there are still some big hurdles to overcome before it becomes a focus of ours gamesbeat what do you expect to be the next big change that affects the way people play games we’ve gone from singleplayer to online multiplayer to massively multiplayer over the past  years we’ve changed the capacity in terms of how people can interact with each other and build communities are there other gamechangers like that you see on the horizon morhaime i feel like there’s still a big opportunity in mobile beyond just casual games i’m not sure we’ve figured out what that is yet gamesbeat from a company culture point of view how did you hold it together for so long you’ve worked together for a long time whether it’s you and frank or you and a lot of other people apparently without driving each other crazy morhaime the biggest key to that is having a shared commitment to quality we’re all trying to do the same thing which is providing the best experience possible for our players when you focus on that and especially when you’re able to achieve that—everyone feels such a sense of mission and accomplishment that keeps us together keeps us going it’s beneficial for our teams to be able to go out to blizzcon and interact with our most passionate players they get to see firsthand how the work they do impacts real people that provides so much fuel and energy for our teams to go back and continue working really hard we don’t want to let these people down above world of warcraft is the mmo kingimage credit blizzard gamesbeat blizzard has a preeminent position in the industry right now as far as the ability to influence the future of esports with how much growth has happened and all the things occurring to make that a mainstream entertainment choice what kind of effort do you see blizzard making to keep that going will you choose to be at the forefront of esports or do you want to focus on game development morhaime we’re at a stage where you can’t really distinguish esports from game development anymore if you’re going to create a competitive game and it’s going to be popular you have to have an esports ecosystem around the game for us it’s all part of delivering an epic entertainment experience for our players it’s a key part of our strategy going forward we’re increasing our investment in esports to make sure that the production quality of these tournaments is high we’ve learned a lot by having esports be a central part of blizzcon all these years we’ve been able to leverage that experience in things like heroes of the storm on espn if that were our first tournament we wouldn’t have been able to achieve the production quality we did last year i don’t think espn would have been as impressed as they were or as interested in working with us again this year esports is just going to grow in importance and popularity as it relates to games i agree with you it has the potential to achieve a much higher massmarket reach it’s really fun to watch gamesbeat what do you think is going to be the greatest challenge in that process you still have a good portion of the mass audience and even of gamers that hasn’t bought in to the idea morhaime one of the challenges is to really humanize it to let people get to know the players more that’s where you start forming an attachment to people finding people to root for the olympics does this really well a lot of olympic sports aren’t that popular but when the olympics comes around they do such a good job of telling you these human stories about the athletes it gives you an appreciation for what they’re able to accomplish they can tell you a great story around the competition we need to get better at that gamesbeat are there things you can do as a company given your impact on the genres involved at this point to help with some of the issues that are still on the table for esports diversity is one that comes to mind there are very few really competitive women players it seems that as you’re broadening to a wider audience having a variety of folks standing up on stage can only help to bring in a broader audience of viewers morhaime it’s a good point there’s also a point of–being able to reach a wider audience with the games themselves will naturally help that we try to make games that are accessible to a wider audience you can hopefully use a blizzard game as an entry point into a genre as we’re able to expand and reach a more diverse audience you’ll automatically see a more diverse group of people entering esports above overwatch is blizzard’s upcoming thirdperson shooterimage credit blizzard gamesbeat what do you think are going to be some of the biggest challenges the company faces in general over the next two years morhaime one challenge we’re facing right now and this isn’t going away—just the volume of content we’re producing and the number of games and platforms and regions we’re supporting it’s on a much greater scale than we’ve dealt with before if you go back five years ago before we launched starcraft ii from a game operational standpoint we were almost exclusively focused on operating world of warcraft now we’re operating six games that are all delivering content to our players we’ll have multiple releases this year just being able to do all this stuff simultaneously at a blizzard quality level—that’s not easy gamesbeat it seems like a scary part of the job if you guys stick to that history—i remember at dice one year that you talked about cancelling eight games one year to cancel a game in this day and age—it seems like the scale is the thing that makes it scary morhaime scale has been a big challenge i’m actually very satisfied with the progress we’ve made over the last few years as far as being able to scale up the organization of the business and being able to level up leadership across all of our franchises they can focus on operating and developing content for each of those games we’re in pretty good shape i’m very excited about  the games we’re working on are excellent but it’s not going to get easier as we release more games it’ll just get more complicated gamesbeat how do you balance that you’re undoubtedly working on new ip for further down the road as well as other forms of entertainment like esports and movies do you have sunset plans for games that have been out for a while are there policies as far as when you might pivot a team from one project to another morhaime those types of plans aren’t onesizefitsall there’s no policy for how we do that it’s driven by what our players want and what our games need to continue being the best they can be gb latest news hyperx’s alloy elite mechanical keyboard keeps the cherry switches and adds media controls amd releases its biggest radeon
