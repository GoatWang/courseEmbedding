investable assets  the firm prides itself on their innovative technology and reporting at caprock reports are built like the company was built to capture the client�s individual needs and then define the technology to meet them  the caprock group rejects the assumption that impact investments inherently yield lower rates of return to the investor impact investing is not philanthropy it is investing only those seeking positive financial return need apply  matthew weatherleywhite cofounder and managing director at the caprock group get the facts  there are three broad groups of impact investors finance first impact first  catalyst first �finance first� investors commit capital with the expectation of financial return and the potential for social or environmental impact �impact first� investors commit capital with the expectation that the investment will have an environmental social andor governance impact and the potential for a financial return and �catalyst first� investors commit capital with the express intention of embracing pioneer risk seeking to expand the impact ecosystem they invest in companies which offer the potential for leveraged impact the caprock group place themselves on the �finance first� end with a bias towards catalyzing investments  impact investing is not socially responsible investing sri impact investing is characterized by investments made into funds companies or organizations with the purpose of generating social and environmental impact as well as seeking a financial return it is often � and incorrectly  likened to socially responsible investing sri where the emphasis is on doing no harm impact investing differs in that it actively seeks to make a positive impact the caprock group enables clients to choose and pursue the options to which their specific interests most align  the caprock group has been a leading contributor to the impact investing movement since  in  jennifer leonard was hired to colead the caprock groups impact investing initiative alongside matthew weatherleywhite that hierarchy has since shifted and the initiative has expanded beyond caprock�s bestguess projections  of the caprock

not only the allimportant �do i have enough� question but also the souldefining question �can i do more good with what i have�  the firm was instrumental in the creation of ipar impact portfolio allocation review which is a standardized framework for impact metrics the number one obstacle for impact is the vast contradictions within the investment community from term definitions to realworld results the industry�s splintering makes crossfund and crossfirm evaluation almost impossible ipar seeks to provide a common language and universal �impact� calibration platform it is based on the
