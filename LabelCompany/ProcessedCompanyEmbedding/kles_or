system the plumber which is an integrated management system for piping stabilization is designed to carry out realtime monitoring the d behavior of plant pipes in operation under high temperature and

thermal expansion and shrinkage due to frequent vibration and repetition of start and stop may cause interference on piping and stress concentration which may lead to turbine vibration or damage to the joint of super heater second the hangers installed at power plants enables to measure only one dimensional yaxis direction displacement currently piping management at each power plant is limited to recording related to hanger guidelines before and after oh so that the d displacement occurring at pipelines during operation may not be detected which leads to impracticability of preparing basic preventive measures and depending of shortterm maintenance third even though large amount of piping support devices such as hangers and snubbers are installed at each power plant in order to support the selfload and thermal expansion load in operation proper management is not carried out due to absence of recognition and lack of management for piping support devices also most of pipelines are

to redirect traffic to your preferred domain pages that load successfully both with and without www are treated as duplicate content  right now either wwwkleskr or kleskr is failing to resolve properly or returns a  error you should set a preferred domain in google search console and use a  redirect to divert traffic from your secondary domain redirect nonwww to www robotstxt medium impact easy to solve httpwwwkleskrrobotstxt  a robotstxt file allows you to restrict the access of search engine crawlers to prevent them from accessing specific pages or directories they also point the web crawler to your page’s xml sitemap fileyour site currently has a robottxt file you can use google search consoles robotstxt tester to submit and test your robottxt file and to make sure googlebot isnt crawling any restricted files add a robotstxt file  xml sitemap medium impact easy to solve missing  we checked kleskr but couldnt find an xml sitemapxml sitemaps contain the list of your urls that are available to index and allows the search engines to read your pages more intelligently they can also include information like your site’s latest updates frequency of changes and the importance of urlsyour site is currently missing an xml sitemap we recommend you generate one for your site and submit it through both google search console and bing webmaster tools normally your xml sitemap would be found at kleskrsitemapmake sure to only include the pages you want search engines to crawl so leave out any that have been blocked in a robotstxt file avoid using any urls that cause redirects or error codes and be consistent in using your preferred urls with or without www correct protocols http vs https and trailing slashes you should also use your robotstxt file to point search engine crawlers to the location of your sitemap add and optimize your xml sitemap url parameters warning weve detected parameters in a significant number of urls  url parameters are used to track user behaviors on site session ids traffic sources referrer ids or to give users control over the content on the page sorting and filtering the issue with url parameters is that google sees each unique parameter value as a new url hosting the same thing  meaning you could have a duplicate content problem sometimes it’s able to recognize these urls and group them together it then algorithmically decides which url is the best representation of the group and uses it to consolidate ranking signals and display in search results you can help google recognize the best url by using the rel”canonical” taguse the url parameters tool in google search console to tell google how your url parameters affect page content and how to to crawl urls with parameters use this tool very carefully  you can easily prevent google from crawling pages you want indexed through overly restrictive crawling settings especially if you have urls with multiple parameters url parameters are used to track
