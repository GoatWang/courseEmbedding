morning and in our reports filed with the securities and exchange commission now id like to turn the call over to jim james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director well good morning thank you for joining our second quarter earnings discussion we will take a slightly different approach today i will review our results and discuss current market conditions and then rich mack will provide financial insight and our guidance before we take your questions joc orourke who will succeed me as mosaics ceo effective tomorrow will provide the outlook for the second half of  lets get right to it our results for the quarter provide a glimpse of what todays mosaic can accomplish with even small improvements in agricultural market conditions we have three key messages for you today first the many strategic moves weve undertaken over the past couple of years have created substantial earnings leverage for mosaic second we are executing our strategy across our operations almost flawlessly and third our strong results are just a glimpse of mosaics future the earnings growth trajectory is evident and it was a much greater promise for our shareholders in the years to come for the quarter mosaic earned  million on net sales of  billion compared with earnings of  million on sales of  billion a year ago the earnings improvement were driven by a higher conflict sales volumes and higher realized potash prices in addition to lower operating costs we earned  per share that number benefited from the lower share count resulting from aggressive repurchase activity importantly we continue to deliver strong operating cash flow with  million generated in the second quarter i would like to point that our earnings per share for this second quarter net of disclosed items were higher than our earnings per share for the second quarter of  which ended before the breakup of the bpc marketing organization potash prices are about  per ton lower than they were then and grain and oilseed prices as well as grower economics are weaker today thats a stark indication of our progress and of our ability to thrive across market cycles how did we accomplish these improvements i wont recount all the actions weve taken but suffice it to say we made timely valuable acquisitions and we integrated them seamlessly we optimized our portfolio by selling or exiting less profitable businesses which significantly improved our cost structure weve made good progress on our goal to generate cost savings of  million from both operating units and the corporate functions and we returned meaningful capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases i know that mosaic will not rest on these laurels but i will leave it to joc to talk about the future business conditions overall improved during the quarter but markets have diverged in different regions of the world in north america where farmers defied wall street expectations and planted enough acreage to deliver another very large crop overly abundant rain in the eastern corn belt damaged corps and led to swings in grain and oilseed prices these recent swings have not changed our expectations for strong second half fertilizer sales the spring fertilizer application season in north america played out as we expected it would farmers who planted crops fertilized them to maximize yield however high beginning channel inventories led to lower sales in north america in the first half the lone soft spot among our major markets was brazil where economic issues delayed fertilizer demand the volatile real the weak overall economy and a temporary freeze on farm credit led to paralysis now with better credit availability and stable grain prices enticing farmers demand is slowly emerging which bodes well for our second half of the year in india the strong demand we expected has developed second quarter dap imports were up  to  million tonnes we increased our expectations and now anticipate that india will import  to  million tonnes of phosphate and  to  million tonnes of potash this year up significantly over  indian farmers are enjoying a relatively strong year with ample monsoon rains and good growing conditions in most areas of the country chinese potash demand has also met our expectations and canpotex is shipping against its record  million tonne contract overall this was a good quarter for mosaic and for the agricultural markets in most of the world for quite some time we have been demonstrating mosaics resilience in tough times and now we are beginning to see the power of our franchise in better markets now ill turn the call over to our cfo rich mack for more insight into the quarter our capital and our guidance rich richard l mack  executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you jim with this as your last earnings call on behalf of mosaics  plus employees across the globe thank you so much for your dedicated leadership and service to mosaic we will certainly miss you now turning to business for the quarter ill begin today with some detail on our three operating segments the phosphates segment continued to generate strong operating results with high sales volumes and relatively stable prices for both our finished products and raw materials market forces are only part of the story in phosphates our improved margin rate in the segment was also driven by high operating rates excellent cost control and solid daytoday operating performance the average dap selling price during the quarter was  per tonne down from  last year raw material prices held their first quarter declines though we do expect market prices for sulfur and ammonia to increase modestly in the second half of the year weve been expressing that our phosphates business underappreciated by the market and were continuing to make notable strides in delivering results in this segment in the potash segment our margins remained strong despite the lack of price improvement our mop cash cost per tonne remained very attractive at  per tonne which includes  per tonne of brine management expenses these low costs are driven by running our low cost canadian mines at higher operating rates exiting higher cost mop production in the us a foreign currency tailwind and by meaningful durable cost reductions in the international distribution segment our higher volumes were driven by the adm acquisition in brazil and paraguay with integration now essentially complete lower margins in the segment primarily reflect the impact of declining prices and delayed fertilizer demand in brazil partially offset by the impact of the weaker local currency on expenses now ill move on to our balance sheet and capital our balance sheet remained strong and we are within our targeted leverage ratio range we have approximately  billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter and mosaic continues to be a very strong generator of cash flow we expect this to continue as we reap the benefits of our recent growth investments and expense management initiatives this cash has driven significant returns for our shareholders as you can see on the slide our capital allocation philosophy which is balanced between investments for growth and shareholder distributions is enhancing our growth and contributing to our increased earnings leverage subsequent to quarterend we completed our  million accelerated share repurchase program going forward we expect to continue normal open market repurchases under the remaining  billion in authorization with any activity being reported out during our regular reporting cycle now lets move on to our guidance for the third quarter in phosphates we expect our gross margin rate to remain in the low  range we expect operating rates in phosphates to be in the mid range sales volumes are expected to range from  to  million tonnes for the third quarter compared with actual sales of  million tonnes in the third quarter of  dap prices are expected to be in the range of  to  per tonne we now expect full year volumes to be at the upper end of our initial estimate at  to  million tonnes international distribution sales volumes are expected to be in the range of  to  million tonnes with a gross margin of  to  per tonne we narrowed full year volume expectations to be in the range of  to  million tonnes in potash we anticipate continuing strong global demand increased potash affordability is driving increased applications north american demand is expected to be strong in the second half and we expect canpotex to ship record tonnes this year during the third quarter we intend to produce at reduced rates because of planned turnarounds at our canadian mines during this period we expect to draw down inventories throughout the quarter we expect operating rates in potash to be in the mid range and sales volumes to be in the range of  to  million tonnes during the third quarter compared with actual sales of  million tonnes in the same period of  with the slower start to the first half of  we now expect full year potash volumes to range from  to  million tonnes average realized prices are expected to be in the range of  to  per tonne with the gross margin rate to be in the low  range both the operating rate and the gross margin rate are in line with last year as a result of the lower production rates in the seasonally slower third quarter our expectation for fullyear sga costs also remains unchanged at  million to  million we continue to make good progress on our cost savings initiatives across the company and we are ahead of schedule as we work towards our goal of achieving  million in savings by  our estimate for canadian resource taxes and royalties has been lowered to  million to  million in part as a result of a higher expected mix of lower priced standard product weve also lowered the topend of our capital expenditure and investment guidance for  with such guidance now being between  billion and  billion all other guidance ranges remain unchanged i should note that projected capital costs for our saudi arabian joint venture have been revised and are now estimated to be about  billion which is about  million more than the initial estimates keep in mind this is a project finance deal so our incremental cash equity contributions will be less than  million nevertheless the project remains strategic and financially compelling to mosaic we considered the potential for costs overruns when we assessed the project and were comfortable with the expected returns even with this higher capital cost as a reminder we expect the ammonia plant to begin operating in mid which will support construction cash flow needs the waad alshamal phosphate complex as a whole is expected to be the lowest cost facility in the world and our investment is expected to generate attractive returns above a riskadjusted weighted average cost of capital as you can see from the photos this is a megaproject and a tremendous amount of work is advancing in the kingdom we will continue to update the market as the work progresses so to close my comments i would summarize by stating that mosaic is making measureable progress in our efficiency and operating performance we are seeing bottomline benefits and we expect further strength in the second half of this year and beyond we continue to monitor north american crop development brazilian fertilizer demand and chinese phosphate exports as the major uncertainties in the second half of  with that i will turn the call over to joc for his comments on the remainder of the year james orourke  executive vice presidentoperations  chief operating officer thank you rich before i discuss the outlook i would like to acknowledge jims remarkable leadership over the past decade i am entering my tenure as ceo with an excellent foundation and an extremely promising future for mosaic and jim deserves a great deal of credit for that now on to our view of the future our outlook for the reminder of the year remains positive with good demand from the big four agricultural regions ill go through them one at a time in north america the extreme wet conditions in the eastern corn belt have reminded us once again that agriculture is unpredictable at the start of the season it look like it might be another record crop but expectations declined and then recently rebounded again despite these swings today our products remain affordable and provide good value for farmers irrespective of neartime market volatility and swings in sentiment at mosaic we manage for success across the whole cycle and for leverage in good times the secular trend remains undeniably positive in china demand is underpinned by high crop prices with nearby corn and wheat futures trading at approximately   per bushel respectively mop shipments climbed to a record last year and are expected to be higher in  demand is accelerating phosphates are a different story in china we expect chinese exports to be in the  to  million tonne range this year which is higher than our previous estimate global supply and demand is likely to remain balanced however due to multiple production challenges in other parts of the world our most recent demand forecast is around  million tonnes stable stripping margins in the first half of  offer a good proof point of balanced supply and demand we will continue to watch closely both the level of exports as well as the broader gdp growth in china elsewhere in asia india has been a bright spot our expectation for  shipments continues to increase in addition to second quarter dap imports at levels more than double last year industry potash sales in india are up almost  in the first half of  this is despite uncertainty about the government subsidy until just a few weeks ago the indian governments new budget included few changes for agriculture as expected but it did provide more certainty for farmers as a result we expect continued strong demand in india through the second half of the year with the monsoon season and the rupee on our closely watched list jim described the economic challenges in brazil while the countrys economy and currency remain volatile fertilizer demand is emerging with the improving availability of credit and stable global grain prices soybean prices in reals are very attractive and if they are going to plant in brazil farmers have to fertilize imports in brazil have been lower than last year but the new demand is helping brazil catch up with expectations that in turn bodes well for the second half of the year and as weve done in the past we continue to play a market leader role leveraging our global presence and allocating tonnes to maximize value most recently we moved tonnes to north america when brazil demand was delayed so dynamics are quite different from region to region overall demand for our products is strong and we expect good demand for the remainder of  at mosaic we are focused on the things we can control and we feel great about our progress were generating significant value from our long list of strategic initiatives were positioning mosaic on the lefthand side of the global cost curves weve integrated our acquisitions well and weve returned substantial capital to our shareholders we have developed a highly resilient model for softer parts of the business cycle and we are beginning to demonstrate substantial earnings leverage in good markets there will be much more to come from mosaic and i look forward to discuss our strategy with you in the months and years ahead now ill turn it back to jim to moderate your questions james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director well thank you joc and operator well now – were now open for questions questionandanswer session operator your first question comes from steve byrne your line is now open – im sorry with jpmorgan steve byrne  bank of america merrill lynch bofa wanted to ask you about the strategic value of your south american distribution business and do you see opportunities to bolton to that other products and other services other than fertilizer distribution and do you have any credit risk in that business james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director good morning steve and its great to have you on our call this morning welcome back the strategic value of our investment in brazil is – this is one of the most rapidly growing agricultural zones in the world bit of a wobble this year with credit issues with some broader economic issues in brazil but agriculture remains one of the real real bright lights bright spots in the brazil economy and it will continue to be that so being in one of the fastest growing agricultural zones with new acres coming in is important to us number one number two that is part of the north – thats part of our home court advantage is the entire western hemisphere nobody can better serve that market particularly on phosphates than mosaic can and we look at that as a destination market for our phosphate production produced in florida and for potash production and just a great farm economy excellent farmers they understand the value of fertilizers they need it to produce the kind of crops they want to produce in brazil so we cant not be there with that im going to turn it over to joc now to speak to what some of the ideas he may have about boltons and then rick is going to speak to the credit risk that we see in brazil thanks steve james orourke  executive vice presidentoperations  chief operating officer thanks steve in terms of boltons obviously our footprint in brazil and paraguay offers us a great opportunity today were focused on our core products i would say that doesnt say anything for the future where we couldnt look at boltons well certainly be looking at other areas in brazil where we can expand out to key markets where were not adequately represented but those will be relatively small addons as opposed to big stepouts richard n mclellan  senior vice presidentcommercial yeah good morning steve its rick we do have credit risk there we have managed it over the last  years very well therell always be credit risk in brazil we feel real good about the quality of customers we have and the quality of the credit that we offer there james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director next question please operator your next question comes from jeff zekauskas with jpmorgan your line is open jeffrey j zekauskas  jpmorgan securities llc good morning i was looking your slide  your potash supply and demand model and if i read your chart right you think that the operating rate in potash for  is above  is that correct and is that a fair appraisal of current market conditions james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director good day joc – or jeff sorry jeffrey j zekauskas  jpmorgan securities llc sure james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director im going to turn it over to mike rahm to give you some color on that thank you michael rahm  vpmarket analysis  strategic planning hey good morning jeff jeffrey j zekauskas  jpmorgan securities llc hi michael rahm  vpmarket analysis  strategic planning no that is correct i think we went through and revised our estimates of effective capacity based on what happened last year we believe with the big surge in demand most players were operating about as hard as they could so we went back and revamped our capacity estimates and the operating rate that we estimate in  is  and thats based on our projected shipments of nearly  million tonnes and our estimate of effective capacity of about  million tonnes jeffrey j zekauskas  jpmorgan securities llc jim then if i could just a followup and james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director okay next question please jeffrey j zekauskas  jpmorgan securities llc normally you have pricing power at these sorts of utilization levels but this time you dont seem to can you comment on that michael rahm  vpmarket analysis  strategic planning yeah i think we talked about some of the delays and deferrals that are taking place in the market this year plus i think a big factor is just whats happened to exchange rates every major supplier of potash around the world is benefiting from the strong dollar and that i think naturally puts some pressure on potash values so i mean i think youve seen some of the financial results where despite the fact that the prices have remained constant or moved down in some markets profitability remains very good and i think you can attribute that to changes in currencies james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director okay moving on to the next question operator thank you your next question comes from yonah weisz with hsbc bank your line is open yonah weisz  hsbc bank plc tel aviv branch hi good morning and thank you for my question id like to ask if i may about chinese dap producers who unlike their urea producing cousins have seem to maintained relatively consistent pricing during  im wondering if you have any thoughts on why this is the case maybe discuss reasons for this relative amount of discipline and perhaps looking into the future can you see any structural reasons on the horizon for this to change either for better or for the worse and if i may just a small additional question on maaden youre increasing the capex do you see maaden at all being delayed james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director yeah good morning yonah im going to leave the mic with mike rahm and then rick mclellan will give some color on what he sees happening in the market and then rich mack will speak to your question about the maaden project over to you mike michael rahm  vpmarket analysis  strategic planning hi good morning yonah nice to talk with you again i dont think its so much id characterize as discipline as just the strength of the fundamentals in the phosphate market we know that before that first half indian imports were up  million tonnes and theres a long litany of production outages worldwide you can start with the closure of mississippi phosphates the suwannee river plant the production problems in tunisia israel and you can go on and on of about eight or nine different outages so frankly i think the market needs those tonnes and thats then the pull much more so then anything going on within china in terms of market discipline or whatever you want to call it richard n mclellan  senior vice presidentcommercial hi yonah its rick i just add on to what mike said is the one structural change that we see coming is the expected implementation of vat in china that likely is expected to happen in september and that will put a further floor under export price capabilities richard l mack  executive vice president and chief financial officer and with respect to your third question yonah on maaden were still targeting the ammonia production to come on line during the third quarter of  with some finished phosphate production targeted by the end of the  but the real rampup for phosphate production will happen sometime during  james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director okay operator on to the next question please operator your next question comes from pj juvekar with citi your line is open pj juvekar  citigroup global markets inc broker yes hi good morning james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director good morning pj pj juvekar  citigroup global markets inc broker  directed – thank you – you said you directed some potash volumes to north america when brazil was weak thats kind of interesting and so in the future if demand doesnt materialize in the emerging markets do you think that results in a more competitive north american market james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director pj im going to have rick mclellan address that question richard n mclellan  senior vice presidentcommercial very good question pj and good morning frankly from our perspective we see globally right now the demand growth happening in both india and china and we see that brazil when we think about whats going to happen in the second half the shortfall in brazil occurred in the first half so were expecting strong movement in the second half there i think youre – you may be also describing what we did on phosphates where we moved phosphates into north america instead of – or into india and instead of north america and now weve held back tonnes from going to brazil into the north american market so through the year our ability and our flexibility from our distribution businesses as well as our strong home court advantage allow us to move product around and not effectively impact the ability of us to service our customers james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director and pj id just like to just reinforce what rick did say the optionality we have with the global distribution system particularly latin america asia southeast asia with operations in india and china throughout latin america it gives us a tremendous flexibility to move product where its needed to hold it back where we dont have room or move it to other locations so its something that is really starting to show its value in this organization thanks for the question next question please operator okay your next question comes from vincent andrews with morgan stanley your line is open vincent s andrews  morgan stanley  co llc thanks good morning everyone and congratulations to joc and jim just want to try to reconcile you had the lowest cash costs of potash in the quarter i think that youve ever had and then youre talking about a low gross profit margin in the third quarter which is pretty close i think with where you were in q  which was the postbpc quarter so im just wondering if you can talk about the third quarter obviously its going to get hurt by fixed cost absorption with the turnarounds but if you sort of normalize that where do you think the comparable cash cost number would be versus q james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director well thanks and good morning vincent im going to – ill miss answering all your questions in my free time ahead you could maybe give me a call at home once in a while and ask whats going on im going to turn this over to joc in a moment but i just want – and thanks for recognizing what has occurred in our potash costs weve brought them down tremendously from well over  to – in the   range – and thats with inclusive of brine cost so i think its some of the lowest potash production costs in north america and competitive with just about anywhere in the world and that was done through – that didnt happen by accident there was a lot of work done by our potash business unit focusing on developing ratable capacity to achieve lowest cost production objective so a tremendous job was done we believe its sustainable there will be little blips ups and downs but we have really found the way to effectively be world cost leading producers of potash joc you can speak to the future james orourke  executive vice presidentoperations  chief operating officer yeah vincent in terms of quarter three basically we have our shutdown quarter where we have a turnaround on all of our big operations in potash during the month of july and august – or sorry – august and september basically but in that you have exactly what you said – you have a lot more absorption – well be running at  circa  run time versus  last quarter but on top of that we will also be absorbing all of the cost of the maintenance of those shutdowns so it is a single quarter event underlying all of that our costs in terms of our manpower costs our productivity costs our equipment costs they are all significantly down from where they were before so we feel were very much on track with our new cost regime and we see that coming back as soon as we get through our shutdowns but no question this quarter will be highly impacted by those turnarounds operator your next question comes from don carson with susquehanna financial your line is open don d carson  susquehanna financial group lllp thank you a couple of questions on potash on slide  you show your brazilian outlook and you are calling for higher second half shipments yearoveryear just wondering why that is given the ongoing i mean credits still expensive the real is weak and potash pricing still seems to be coming down there and then if you could just comment on north american – you show shipments down yearoveryear in the second half – whats going on versus consumption versus inventory drawdowns as it relates to shipment levels james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director well good day don im going to have rick mclellan our commercial leader address that question richard n mclellan  senior vice presidentcommercial yeah good morning don on brazil potash if you take a look at whats happened in the first half and then take a look at what our fullyear forecast is for demand in brazil it would tell you that were going to have to have a very strong second half shipment of potash there is still the headwinds on credit there still is the volatility thats happening with the currency but through it all its a very strong agricultural environment and there will be a lot of people that want to farm with a pencil and paper rather than let the farmers decide what theyre going to do and the farmers in brazil if theyre going to plant a crop and you have to give that as a given then theyre going to have to fertilize so thats where we expect whats happening there in north america i think its a function of working through inventory that was built in the first half and so we expect kind of normalized shipments in the second half with the exception of last year we looked at people filling in that december period and so yearonyear we dont know whether people will step in and buy in north america in the second half and so – after they get done the fall season – so weve pulled down our forecast for the back half to reflect that lack of fill potential that could come in that december period operator your next question comes from chris parkinson of credit suisse your line is open christopher s parkinson  credit suisse securities usa llc broker perfect thank you just a similar question on as was just asked with china on slide  you have a fairly large  halfoverhalf increase for chinese mop shipments is this a functionality of just the delayed contract signing at the beginning of the year and basically some shipments being pushed into q that would have otherwise been in q or do you believe that theyre continuing to increase application rates – any sensibility of building inventory – just any color there would be appreciated thank you james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director hey good morning chris dr rahm why dont you take that question michael rahm  vpmarket analysis  strategic planning sure i think its much more of the former chris china has contracted by our estimate for firm tonnage of about  million tonnes for delivery by vessel and that assumes a certain amount of rail deliveries as well they also have about  million tonnes of optional tonnage so the numbers that we showed on that slide reflect the expectation that they will execute on their optional tonnage and if they do that totals about  million tonnes operator your next question comes from ben isaacson with scotiabank your line is open ben isaacson  scotiabank gbm hi thank you i was hoping just to get a bit of an update on microessentials and specifically can you just talk about how the economics are doing versus dap number one number two what is the growth strategy for microessentials beyond brazil and north america and then finally just talk a little bit about your patents and when do those expire and how do you manage that thank you james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director hey good day ben im going to turn it over to rick mclellan in a minute to talk about how were doing economically but just wonderful that you asked question about the patent infringement case perhaps our gc whos in the room with us today could add some color but we got some very positive news last week that most of the claims virtually all of the claims have been thrown out by the court reviewing the matter so as far as were concerned we are in the clear on the patent infringement issue that was before us so do you want to say anything to that mark – mark isaacson our gc mark j isaacson  secretary vice president  general counsel sure thanks jim yeah i would just add that the litigation that were involved in the federal litigation is – has been on hold for a number of years while the plaintiffs patent claims have been reviewed at the patent and trademark office and as it stands right now most of those claims are back for review at the patent and trademark office and have been held to be invalid by – at this latest review and so again i think well continue the litigation hold at this point and though the rest of it remains to be seen but we think were in a very good shape at this point james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director okay rick why dont you talk about the economics im going to have joc just speak to the production expansion after rick addresses the economics of mes  richard n mclellan  senior vice presidentcommercial yeah good morning ben on microessentials we continue to ship on demand in those two key markets brazil and north america although we are developing markets in central and other parts of south america and so as we look for future growth i would say there is still growth potential in north america weve been constricted by our production capabilities the key piece for us is the returns for farmers are still there versus their traditional phosphate fertilizer programs with microessentials so the ability for the dealer to charge a premium and ourselves is there as we look at other growth markets that wed like to look at once we get expanded production that jocs going to talk about one of the markets wed really like to look at thats similar to north america is europe and so were still doing some work on that operator your next question comes from james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director im sorry were just going to have joc speak to the question about where were going with our production expansion where were at with that james orourke  executive vice presidentoperations  chief operating officer yeah so let me finish that whole thought there ben with the – first of all the expansion as youre well aware we added  million of capital about a year ago now which will take our total capacity up to  million tonnes and as rick says we continue to have opportunities to grow that product in a number of places around the world but let me also take a step back and talk a little about the patents that we have as mark mentioned those patents were being – the infringement case has been basically thrown out but more important necessarily than the patent protection is theres a heck of lot of art and skill to producing microessentials so we dont necessarily use the patents as the only protection against the ip theres been a lot of copycats but what weve found so far is that they havent competed agronomically and certainly from a manufacturing perspective nobody has come close to what we make yet james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director okay thank you sorry for interrupting operator if youd carry on with the next question operator your next question comes from joel jackson with bmo capital markets your line is open joel d jackson  bmo capital markets canada hi good morning a couple of questions first question is you talked a bit about pulling tonnes out of brazil so the first question would be there seems to be more pressure on imports coming into the us phosphate market so maybe talk about how aggressively you would defend the us market versus some of your other objectives in phosphate and second question is just on looking over what potash corp is contemplating with ks there is a lot of chatter about potash corp would try to get the legacy mine when completed into canpotex could you maybe give your thoughts on that the process and if youd be opposed the legacy mine if built being put into canpotex thanks james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director hi joel im going to have rick address the question on the market in brazil and then ill touch on the legacy in canpotex richard n mclellan  senior vice presidentcommercial yeah good mooring joel as we looked at the brazil market we did instead of pushing product into brazil brought it back put it in – were putting it into place here at home in north america and frankly at todays prices im not sure that theres a big amount of phosphates headed to north america and were very well positioned to defend our us market if you can remember in the at the end of the first quarter we lifted tonnes from the us and placed them in india were doing this again so that we dont put pressure on to markets we didnt want to pressure the north american market we moved it to india we dont want to pressure brazil were keeping it in north america it is our real competitive advantage to be able to take that optionality that we have with our distribution businesses and our home court advantage and use it to help maintain strong market positions jim james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director thanks rick you asked a question about legacy and what would happen if potash were to acquire ks really no comment and we have no insights on whats going to happen with that with those – with whatever discussions or whatever is going on but legacy in saskatchewan if they were part of canpotex i dont see what the issue would be i personally dont see mosaic having a objection to that happening and canpotex is a extraordinary organization in terms of being able to deliver potash to world markets at the lowest logistics costs anywhere along with the brand that canpotex has in the market for – our governance how we do business the quality of business so i would have a little doubt that others would want to be part of canpotex if they were producing potash in saskatchewan thanks joel operator and your next question comes from andrew wong with rbc capital markets your line is open andrew d wong  rbc dominion securities inc hi thanks for taking my questions so in brazil is there potentially a timing or logistics issue to ship product into the country if demand doesnt pick up soon for their planting window or application window and then second going into the back half of this year it appears the ammonia market may be a bit tighter could you just talk about your expectations on the input cost side of things for the phosphate segment thanks james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director good day andrew ricks going to speak to the market question and brazil and joc could address the ammonia material costs richard n mclellan  senior vice presidentcommercial good morning andrew and the logistics issue that you suggest will happen is happening and the key piece will be is how backed up and how available product will be able to move into that marketplace as farmers have put off their buying decisions they certainly havent put off their decisions to plant i think it was interesting yesterday there was a report out of brazil that versus previous years where farmers had sold  of their forward crop to get ready for planting theyre at  so if the farmer will need to – if he decides to plant and he will plant given all the indications – hes going to need to apply fertilizer and the fact that mosaic has its own port at paranaguá allows us to have an advantage in getting product into that country joc james orourke  executive vice presidentoperations  chief operating officer yeah andrew so on the question of ammonia pricing there is a fundamental probably tightening of the ammonia market – sorry when i say fundamental – a slight tightening of the ammonia market that will happen in the second half of the year trinidad gas restrictions ammonia going to urea et cetera both will impact ammonia but we see that as a pretty slight increase in cost of ammonia the other one thats probably tightening at the second half of the year is sulfur where if indian demand – or sorry – chinese demand continues to be high for sulfur theres a reasonable differential between north america and international sulfur so we could see some strength in the sulfur price as well however in sulfur with the building of our own melter we should really be able to change the dynamic of that for mosaic so were seeing slightly higher prices but i dont believe its going to hurt our overall stripping margin by all that much james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director good thanks joc operator next question operator your next question comes from mark connelly with clsa your line is open mark w connelly  clsa americas llc thank you and congratulations jim youre certainly going out on a high point with these numbers two things first can you tell us about the impact of brazil on your working capital and seasonality i know theres never going to be any such thing as normal in brazil but you must have thought something about it as you decided to expand your system and the second question is can you tell us about logistics issues in the us and whether thats meaningfully impacting your plan for this upcoming quarter james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director good morning mark and good to hear from you and thanks for that positive comment im going to have rich mack our cfo speak to the impact of what he is seeing on working capital in brazil and then rick or joc can speak to the logistics questions impacting north america richard l mack  executive vice president and chief financial officer so mark yes i mean part of analysis and something that were measuring is working capital needs in brazil one its high season down there upcoming and second our footprint is bigger and so were very mindful of that and we want to be as efficient as we possibly can on working capital going forward were still getting our grounding with respect to the acquisition of finalizing the integration of adm and to date we havent seen any anomalies that have been outside of our expectations with respect to whats going on with respect to working capital james orourke  executive vice presidentoperations  chief operating officer mark in terms of your question about logistics in phosphates with the heavy rains weve been having in florida that could have some impact on logistics we dont expect we wont be able to – we expect we will be able to work through that – but its always a risk in terms of our potash shipments we really dont see anything on the horizon were clearly going to be drawing down inventory because of our turnaround schedule but in general we dont see logistics being a big impact for quarter three those are normally if theyre going to hurt us will hurt us in that quarter four and first quarter where we have the winter months in canada james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director okay operator our next question please operator your next question comes from adam samuelson with goldman sachs your line is open adam samuelson  goldman sachs  co jim i want to wish you well and congratulations on the retirement maybe the question first and i dont – and i apologize i jumped on the call late – but i wasnt clear from what was in the press release and the slides how if at all your  global potash view had changed and specifically wanted to understand the drivers of the lower reduction in potash shipments for the year is that just north america domestic shipments and then finally how has the view on southeast asia changed given some of the pressures in palm oil and some of the currency pressures there thank you james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director well good day good day andrew thanks for those comments and its been a pleasure working with you and your keen interest in the crop nutrition sector im going to turn the global potash view over to mike and he can just give his view of what he sees michael rahm  vpmarket analysis  strategic planning no – good morning adam – no we havent changed our view all that much we have narrowed our shipment range from  to  million tonnes to  to  and i can tell you that our point estimate right is at the very upper end of that range and as we noted in earlier question our assessment of effective capacity is a little bit over  million tonnes so that results in an operating rate of about  so we think fundamentals remain constructive or positive i think we noted on another question that prices have not – have softened a bit – but i think thats symptomatic of the fact that all major suppliers are benefiting from a very very strong dollar james t prokopanko  president chief executive officer  director okay with that – and thank you mike – with that ill conclude this call first please allow me a brief personal note here the decade ive been spent – ive spent leading mosaic – has been one of the most fulfilling times in my long carrier in agriculture and im pleased that ive got to know so many of our investors and really got to know them quite well
