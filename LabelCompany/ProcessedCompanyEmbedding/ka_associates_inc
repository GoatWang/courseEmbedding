finest suppliers in our industry  however more important are our distributors  we appreciate their support in presenting and promoting our products  we sincerely enjoy helping new distributors and invite them to contact us to learn more about becoming successful promoting the suppliers we represent as a result we have developed many personal friendships with our customers michael fields joined the company in  in an effort to further extend our supplier representation in our territory  in  doug yount also joined our sales team bringing in over  years of industry experience and providing us with an opportunity to expand our territory  both michael and doug  provide us with depth in our outside sales team that allows us to connect with as many quality distributors in our territory as possible lastly all distributors have our word that any business we discuss together will be strictly confidential  this is one of the many reasons our company has been successful in building long

rheed ksa mos ksa raterat pro ksa spectratemp overview rheed analysis stress physical vapor deposition pvd is the most widely used technology for depositing materials as a thin film onto a host substrate  from metals to semiconductor materials to the most complicated optical film stacks pvd is the most common deposition method pvd is used in the manufacture of a wide range of goods including semiconductor devices aluminized pet film for balloons and snack bags optical coatings and filters coated cutting tools for metalworking and wear resistance and highly reflective films for decorative displays pvd tools have also been developed for the fabrication of extremely thin films ie films only nanometers in thickness pvd deposition tools can deposit monolayers of virtually any material including materials with melting points up to  °c there are variants of the pvd process whereby the method for generating the physical vapor is different but all processes take place in a vacuum chamber of some type pvd like other deposition processes benefits from in situ process monitoring the pvd coating method involves a purely physical process the three most common processes are  plasma sputtering  pulsed laser deposition  ebeam evaporation the film materials are transferred via various methods from some starting ‘target’ with subsequent condensation onto the host substrate pvd

metalorganic chemical vapor deposition mocvd sometimes called metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy movpe is a much higher throughput technique compared with mbe and as such is the production deposition tool of choice for most compound semiconductor devices such as high brightness led’s hbled worldwide there are several researchlevel mocvd tool manufacturers including structured materials taiyo nipponsanso valence process equipment samco  and others however at the production level there are two companies that dominate sales and have over  percent of the collective market share veeco turbodisc and aixtron mocvd relies on the gas phase transfer of the materials to be deposited on the substrate the deposition ultimately occurs via a chemical reaction at the substrate surface and typically results in high quality epitaxial thinfilm deposition because mocvd utilizes heated gas flow and surface chemical reaction substrate temperatures for typical device growth are higher than mbe and in the  degrees celcius range in addition the sample can be rotated at speeds as high as  rpm to promote higher uniformity and film quality furthermore optical access is typically limited to less than mm and the optical path distance is typically short eg mm or less in addition mocvd deposition occurs at pressures close to atmospheric pressure which precludes in situ metrology that utilize electron beams or xrays for these reasons in situ optical metrology probes for mocvd are typically compact in size the ksa ice metrology tool is small compact and easy to use this tool offers in situ direct substrate temperature wafer carrier temperature film thickness thinfilm stresswafer curvature and surface roughness measurement in realtime film thickness reflectance and growth rate can all be measured in realtime for process control using the ksa ice reflectivity module you can have the measurements you need for improved process control quality and efficiency each layer can be

need temperature can be measured with both the ksa ice emissivity corrected pyrometry temperature module and the band edge module ksa scanning pyro creates high resolution full temperature maps of veeco ki and epik wafer carriers and wafers  these maps are greatly enhancing the ability to perform process optimization realtime substrate curvature and film stress measured with the ksa ice

phase ii from the us doe we are pleased to announce that we received a m phase ii small business innovation research sbir award from the us department of energy doe the purpose is to develop an “advanced highsensitivity multispecies in situ film growth monitor utilizing atomic absorption spectroscopy” phase i of the project was successfully completed by kspace in november  under phase i a prototype atomic absorption spectroscopy aas instrument was developed and tested on a sputter deposition system at argonne national laboratory the instrument to be commercialized will provide realtime atomic flux measurements to enable highaccuracy film growth control during the deposition of a broad variety of thinfilm materials read more here a practical guide to ksa mos do you wonder how other
