what is a hedge fund a closer look at hedge funds there are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers hedge fund industry – assets under management usd billions

capital wisdom value longterm horizon worldly wisdom growth at reasonable priceunconventional capital wisdom llcsummarytracking smallcap super investors might be more worthwhile for smaller investors than tracking largecap super investorsbares capital has been graduating to larger smallcap equitiesthe firms reduction of small and microcaps is likely due to both the graduation and also due to the nine ten partners lp transferinvestors often check the holdings of super investors but they often limit themselves to investors that focus on larger midcap or largecap companies super investors with a lot of capital to manage are restricted to those larger companies while investors with smaller amounts of capital do not have the same restrictions a continued run up in the overall market especially the larger more well known companies leaves those large super investors with an even more limited number of companies to choose from while they might have trouble finding ideas there still are s of smaller companies that go unnoticed by analysts the market and larger institutions to circumvent this investors can follow super investors that focus on microcaps and smallcap companies where there tends to be greater opportunities to find inefficiently priced quality companies even in bull markets one investor that has been restricting their assets under management to continue to invest in microcaps and smallcaps is brian bares although we do not know his firms exact performance we do know that in his first year of operation his fund returned  on  million and fourteen years later manages over a billion dollars his philosophy tends to lean towards warren buffett and charlie munger focusing on owning only a hand full of quality businesses with quality managers and allowing the company to internally compound capital at high rates since he began focusing on microcaps he essentially was finding those quality companies in their infancy and letting them compound capital at high rates the following interview gives a better idea of brian bares philosophy brian has written about the institutional investing imperative where super investors tend to start in the inefficient smallcap space and once achieving high performance they have a profit incentive to gather more assets  institutions are also more likely to invest  thus making it more difficult to continue investing in the microcap and small cap areas of the market he calls this graduating to bigger markets where there is more institutional competition and more efficient markets q portfolio changes bares capital has been able to continue to invest in the microcap space  million market cap since bares was content capping assets under management which is unusual with institutional fund managers what we have noticed however is that bares capital management looks to continuing graduation from microcaps to small caps above  million in market cap and most above  billion looking at the firms transactions in the recent quarter eight out of the eleven companies below  million in market cap saw their positions reduced intl wina reis fhco utmd oflx tlf source mkt cap from yahoo finance sec filings our calculations it is likely that these positions have been reduced less for valuation reasons and more to do with the firms graduation to larger equities since bares capital manages  billion aum and companies in the over  million market cap constitute more than  of the firms portfolio what is also notable is that in the last few months the above companies have been transferred from bares capital to nine ten partners lp which is a hedge fund directed by bares capital what is interesting is that only these smallcap companies have been listed so far under nine ten partners while the larger company holdings are yet to be listed with nine ten our educated guess is that some institutions and the partners of bares elected to continue their focus on microcaps and smaller smallcap companies as we guessed in this article the transfer is likely to have caused bares to reduce their positions potentially due to giving some capital back to some investors xpo logistics nysemktxpo is another position that was reduced in the quarter  that is well above  million  that is also included as nine tens holdings the only companies with an  million market cap that were added to were americas
