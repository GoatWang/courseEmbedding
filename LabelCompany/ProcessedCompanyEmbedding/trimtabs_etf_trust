holdings etf investingzackscomtrimtabs etf trust has recently filed a posteffective amendment for two etfs  one focusing on the domestic market and the other on international markets the funds  trimtabs international freecashflow etf and trimtabs us freecashflow etf  are expected to trade under the tickers fcfi and fcfd following their launch below we have highlighted some of the details about the etfs for investors seeking to know more about these inregistration funds fcfi in focus as per the sec filing the proposed passively managed etf looks to provide exposure to international companies poised for rapid growth by tracking the performance of the trimtabs international freecashflow index before fees and expenses for this purpose the index focuses on companies with high free cash flow yield including reits free cash flow here refers to the total cash generated by the company after spending the money required to maintain or expand its operations while free cash flow yield is the ratio of a companys free cash flow to its market capitalization the index follows an equal weighted strategy which ensures a welldiversified portfolio moreover the index seeks to provide exposure to  countries including australia canada china france germany japan korea the netherlands switzerland and the uk the fund will charge  basis points as fees fcfd in focus the proposed fund looks to track the performance of the trimtabs us freecashflow index before fees and expenses the passively managed fund focuses solely on us companies including reits having a high free cash flow yield fcfd in short follows the same strategy as fcfi and also charges the same fees but with a domestic focus how might it fit in a portfolio free cash flow is one of the important tools to measure the performance of a company usually most investors focus on fundamental indicators such as the pricetoearnings ratio pe book value pricetobook pb and the peg ratio to select companies with strong fundamentals they often ignore free cash flow measures however the free cash flow yield offers a better representation of the companys performance and in most cases give a fairer picture of the company than other fundamental measures fcfi and fcfd which focus on companies with high cash flow yield are expected to hold some of the best performing international and domestic companies respectively etf competition presently there arent many funds focusing on this space however we have two funds from cambria  one focused on the domestic space and the other on the international front  providing exposure to companies that generate high free cash flow and in turn look to return these to shareholders in the form of cash dividends share repurchases or by reducing their leverage cambria shareholder yield etf nysearcasyld with an asset base of  million is based on the research that free cash flow is a key predictor of a companys strength this product invests in companies that show strong characteristics in returning free cash flow to their shareholders by way of cash dividends share repurchases or by reducing their leverage the actively managed fund has a diversified portfolio of  stocks and charges  basis points as fees cambria foreign shareholder yield etf batsfyld on the other hand also works on the same proposition as syld but focuses on stocks from foreign developed countries the fund manages an asset base of  million and includes companies with the best combination of dividend payments and net stock buybacks the fund charges the same fee as syld thus fcfi and fcfd if launched have a fair chance of building assets for themselves given the lack of competition in the spaceabout this articleexpandtagged etfs  portfolio strategy etf analysiswant to share your

etfs – one focusing on the domestic market and the other on international markets the funds – trimtabs international freecashflow etf and trimtabs us freecashflow etf – are expected to trade under the tickers fcfi and fcfd following their launch below we have highlighted some of the details about the etfs for investors seeking to know more about these inregistration fundsfcfi in focus as per the sec filing the proposed passively managed etf looks to provide exposure to international companies poised for rapid growth by tracking the performance of the trimtabs intl freecashflow index before fees and expenses for this purpose the index focuses on companies with high free cash flow yield including reits  free cash flow here refers to the total cash generated by the company after spending the money required to maintain or expand its operations while free cash flow yield is the ratio of a company’s free cash flow to its market capitalization read reit etfs for income and diversification the index follows an equal weighted strategy which ensures a welldiversified portfolio moreover the index seeks to provide exposure to  countries including australia canada china france germany japan korea the netherlands switzerland and uk the fund will charge  basis points as feesfcfd in focus the proposed fund looks to track the performance of the trimtabs us freecashflow index before fees and expenses the passively managed fund focuses solely on us companies including reits having a high free cash flow yield fcfd in short follows the same strategy as fcfi and also charges the same fees but with a domestic focus read dividend boom and share buybacks put these etfs in focushow might it fit in a portfolio free cash flow is one of the important tools to measure the performance of a company  usually most investors focus on fundamental indicators such as the pricetoearnings ratio pe book value pricetobook pb and the peg ratio to select companies with strong fundamentals they often ignore free cash flow measures however the free cash flow yield offers a better representation of the companys performance and in most cases give a fairer picture of the company than other fundamental measures fcfi and fcfd which focus on companies with high cash flow yield are expected to hold some of the best performing international and domestic companies respectivelyetf competition presently there aren’t many funds focusing on this space however we have two funds from cambria – one focused on the domestic space and the other on the international front –providing exposure to companies that generate high free cash flow and in turn look to return these to shareholders in the form of cash dividends share repurchases or by reducing their leveragecambria shareholder yield etf syld  free report with an asset base of  million is based on the research that free cash flow is a key predictor of a company’s strength this product invests in companies that show strong characteristics in returning free cash flow to their shareholders by way of cash dividends share repurchases or by reducing their leverage read cambria debuts us etf with zero management fee the actively managed fund has a diversified portfolio of  stocks and charges  basis points as feescambria foreign shareholder yield etf fyld on the other hand also works on the same proposition as syld but focuses on stocks from foreign developed countries the fund manages an asset base of  million and includes companies with the best combination of dividend payments and net stock buybacks the fund charges the same fee as syld see all broad developed world etfs here thus fcfi and fcfd if launched have a fair chance of building assets for themselves given the lack of competition in the space   want the latest
