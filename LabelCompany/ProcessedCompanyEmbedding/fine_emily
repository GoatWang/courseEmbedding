i used cleansing cleansing conditioner on my fine hair  heres what happened homepage news entertainment beauty fashion lifestyle books tech flowcharts company about us advertise apps labs terms privacy dmca contact follow us ®  bustle i used cleansing cleansing conditioner on my fine hair  heres what happened share this by emily mcclure feb   weve likely all seen the informercials for the hair care line wen by chaz dean at some point in our lives you know the ones with all the gorgeous woman shaking their hair around and swearing that the cleansing conditioner is basically magic in a bottle as a diehard haircare fanatic i had to see if the rumors were true i decided to put the wen cleansing conditioner to the test to see if it could transform my thin hair into luscious tvworthy strands  if you havent heard of the wen cleansing conditioners these products are essentially an allinone shampoo conditioner and styling treatment the brand boasts that these products can work well for any hair type depending on which formulation you try personally i reached for the fig version as it promised to give my hair moisture bounce and shine  while there have recently been some notsoexcellent but also quite rare reports of negative side effects from using this stuff i was willing to take the chance as someone who loves beauty products im aware there is always a risk when trying out new products with that said heres how the wen cleansing conditioner worked for my fine thin hair  wen sweet almond mint cleansing conditioner  sephora  day  before after a day filled with planes trains and automobiles i was in desperate need of a shower as you can see in the photo with that in mind i thought it would also be a good time to start my wen cleansing conditioner experiment my hair was already greasyfrizzyunruly when i arrived home so i wanted to see what sort of magic this cleansing conditioner could pull off  the first thing i want to point out about this product is just how much of it the brand actually recommends using printed on the back label the brand suggests using using  pumps of product for short hair  pumps for medium hair and  pumps for long hair to me that sounds like actual insanity why do you need that much product on your hair as someone with fine hair i immediately began to worry about this weighing my hair down  normal amount of shampoo i use vs amount recommended by wen shampoo here is the normal amount of shampoo that i have to use to clean my hair and scalp   wen cleansing conditioner here is how much wen i had to use as per recommended on the bottle shown in the photo above is ten pumps this amount is the minimum recommended amount for any length of hair my strands were quaking in their roots  after once i got into the shower i pumped the large amount of product into my hands and spread evenly across my hair as recommended in the product directions i massaged the conditioner into my scalp and pulled through across my ends i let the product soak in for a few minutes and then rinsed  i noticed while i was massaging in the product that my hair felt almost thicker it seems crazy but it actually felt like i had more hair also i noticed that less strands were falling out midshower as any girl with longer hair might i tend to notice strands pilling up in my shower however nothing fell out when i used wen it was great after my shower i blow dried my hair to see the end result it looked more shiny and bouncy in my opinion honestly i was just happy that it was clean  day  when i woke up the next morning my roots were already greasy this was an unexpected surprise as it usually take a day or two of being unwashed for my hair to get oily unfortunately i had to run errands this morning and didnt have time to shower however i did have time for a kitten selfie to show you just how stringy my hair looked  the photo above is my preshower photo typically i have volume in the morning that fades away during the afternoon however my hair was already looking greasy and flat  when i arrived home i immediately jumped in the shower after going through the whole cleansing and blow drying routine again my hair resumed to that shiny voluminous look from day  it still felt great in the shower despite the product amount and i love my after look however i was still wary of the product due to how greasy my roots were before i showered it had only been  hours of using the product and my hair already wasnt acting like its normal self day  on day  i woke with wondering what in the world my hair would be looking like thankfully my roots werent as greasy as they had been the morning of day  but they still were oilier than i would like  i hopped in the shower used the cleansing conditioner and even was extra careful to thoroughly wash out the product just in case it was leftover product that was making my hair so greasy once again i loved the end result after i blow dried my hair i will admit thought that i used other products to style my hair on this day like heat protectant and texturizing paste i usually use styling products on a daytoday basis so i wanted to see how these would match up with the wen  going on throughout my day i noticed my hair get flatter this is pretty typical for my straight strands so i wasnt too bothered by it however at the end of this very long day i noticed my hair still looked pretty shiny and healthy overall i was impressed  day  on day  i woke up late and therefore i had zero time to shower thankfully i work at a hair salon so i knew i was going to be able to style my hair much to my horror however my hair was a total greaseball when i finally looked at it in a mirror i hadnt noticed before i arrived at the salon but my hair was a frizzy greasy mess it was the epitome of a bad hair day  after loads of dry shampoo and curling see photo above my roots still werent looking any better i was literally counting down the hours until i could shower  dry bar detox dry shampoo  check it out t bodywaver curling iron  check it out day  so day  wasnt that bad i showered in the morning applied the product and had a normal great result my only downside is that after i curled my hair the waves fell a little more quickly than normal however my locks were super soft from the wen so i knew my chances for longlasting waves werent good to begin with this was the first time that whole week were i was totally confident about my hair from start to finish  day  by day  i was settling into a routine with wen if i was going to use the product i had to use it morning in order to have clean looking hair even though i still prefer to shower at night i didnt want to chance having greasy hair  that night i went out for drinks with a few friends and they surprisingly commented on how shiny my hair looked it was definitely the confidence booster i needed after a week of hair struggles  day  on the last day of my experiment i continued my routine of waking up early to shower and style my hair as i had a busy day ahead of me i didnt want to have to worry about another disastrous hair day after my styling i noticed once again that my curls seemed to fall a little faster than normal but besides that my hair looked great  final thoughts the wen cleansing conditioner is a great product for those with fine hair who make a point to shower and style their hair every morning if youre a slightly lazier person like myself then this may not be your goto product while it made my hair look fabulous postshower my strands became extremely oily and unmanageable if i tried to skip a day between washes — or even if id showered the night before it was definitely a lovehate relationship throughout the week however i can see myself reaching for the conditioner again on days when i crave a little extra shine if i get myself out of bed on time  wen cleansing conditioner  check it out images emily mcclure must reads confessions of a former extension addict emily maynard photo credit my insanely talented friend lindsay alexander photography  check out her blog too  confessions of a former extension addict november   by emily  comments hi my name is emily and i used to be addicted to hair extensions i’ve had every kind from the bonded to the tapeins to simple clipins and of course had the broken off hair to show for it on top of that i don’t know if you all remember but last year september th  not that i’ve kept track or anything i got bangs cut and as embarrassing as it is to admit it was a traumatizing experience to say the least just picture me hiding under my covers and ordering headbands on my computer like a maniac not pretty over the past year i have been on a mission to get my hair to be as healthy as possible all the while avoiding the easy fix of throwing in some extensions so here are my biggest tips for growing your hair out and keeping it as healthy as possible   hair vitaimins–  i give these to all of my friends that are trying to grow their hair out and they really do work so quickly after i got my bangs cut i started taking these and they were significantly grown out after a month of taking these vitamins even my husband noticed wet brush– this is pretty much the only hairbrush i use besides my mason pearson brush if you’re not ready to splurge on a mp try this one it’s so much easier on your hair than a traditional hairbrush deep conditioner i use this living proof hair treatment once a week scrunchies i put my hair in a bun on the top of my head with a giant scrunchie every night silk pillowcase– i bought this at sephora and it has made my blow outs last so much longer dry shampoo this is a safe place right please don’t judge me but i wash my hair about once a week part because its not good to wash your hair too much and mostly because i’m lazy i buy this living proof dry shampoo in bulk what are your secrets for growing out a bad haircut or just keeping your hair healthy leave them in comments   comments rebecca mersiowsky says november   at  am mane  tail shampooconditioner works wonders i have tried a zillion different salon products but this leaves my hair soft and shiny and helps my blow out last all week reply jillian oliver says november   at  am my favorite things for growing hair healthy and long is coconut oil and biotin i use the coconut oil as a hair mask for a min of hrs i also sleep in it over night i did the same thing as you years ago and now reversing the damage hope this helps reply shalane says november   at  am i only wash my hair once a week also one because i have a  month old and don’t have time for that nonsense and two i am also a bit lazy i confess to being an extension addict my hair has been the same length for  years and i cannot get it to grow so i finally bought me some clipins about  months ago i love the look but hate the hassle i am going to look into those vitamins and be on the search for the scrunchies i made in th grade home and family class reply shalane says november   at  am also i did not notice that my caps lock was on so that comment looks ridiculous  reply olivia says november   at  am hi emily your hair looks

pretty with your shorter hair cut years ago you have a nice face for short hair and about the hair tips i swear this works it sounds crazy but try and hang upside down off you bed a doctor told me once that this causes the blood to rush to your scalp if you do this a few minutes a day it works and give yourself or have someone else give you a scalp massage like  minutes a day this alone worked i have blonde hair too and a month after doing both of these things my roots were like inches longer than usual reply ashley lane says november   at  am hi emily you may already be planning to do a

art you lovethe number one rule for selecting artwork is that it should speak to you if it isn’t meaningful in any way it’s best to keep searching if you’ve themed your furniture and décor around a certain color or idea that can get you started in your search many paintings and other artwork have a cultural theme such as aboriginal art or japanese art on the other hand black and white photography goes great with anything whatever style you choose just make sure it represents your tastes interests or history check out every type of wall art out thereif you’re looking for paintings that fit perfectly with your traditional décor consider fine art prints these are a great alternative if you can’t afford genuine picasso paintings or works by other famous artists pencil art and some sculptures can also fit in well with a traditional scheme if you’re in the mood for some modern artwork illustrations and mixed media are a great place to start sculptures made from metal or glass can also have a modern tone try going bold with abstract paintings urban art or pop art which tend to incorporate more modern influences like graffiti and celebrities plus bright colors photographs work well with any décor as they can cross between modern and traditional easily depending on the subject matter don’t be afraid to mix and match either a modern piece can go amazingly well with a traditional home and vice versa arrange your new artwork for optimal viewingonce you’ve found those perfect meaningful pieces you’ll want to place them in a spot that allows everyone who passes by to admire them common locations for artwork include above a seating area or better yet facing your seating arrangement proper lighting and visibility is also important as is hanging your new pieces at the correct height aim for eye level or the gallery standard which says the center of your paintings should be approximately  inches from the floor embed photo open photo in new window pagetype

artwork your own photo collage can add a personal touch to any room while mirrors can make a small space seem larger thanks to their reflective qualities if storage is an issue use shelves and stack them with fun trinkets or flowers don’t forget about the wall itself add some flavor with colorful patterned wallpaper or go for a brightly painted accent wall home decorations make great table toppersif your living room needs a lift liven it up by adding a few thoughtful home decor accessories photos always make great additions but keep them interesting by mixing and matching your frames when lit candles add a romantic relaxing feel and coffee table books about travel home design fashion or photography make for great conversation starters house decorations can cozy up your floorwhile floor space may be limited there’s always room for a wellplaced area rug or two these are a great way to add texture color and warmth to a hardwood or tile floor choose a traditional floral pattern or some funky chevrons to get started then pair your pattern with a textured berber rug or soft shag for ultimate indulgence add some vibrancy to neutralcolored furniture one of the easiest ways to punch up a look is through the fabric you display swap out throw pillows and blankets to liven up a dull home decor foundation and search right here on houzz for bold or mismatched patterns comfy throws and
