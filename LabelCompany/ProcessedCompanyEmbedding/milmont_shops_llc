doesnt require any formal education floral designers must know how to care for the plants they use and which ones work best for which season or event additionally a skilled floral arranger must also be familiar with the cultural symbolism behind each flower for instance carnations symbolize beauty and pride while daisies represent innocence and purityif you plan to give someone a flowering plant as a gift then a good florist can direct you to the right one they may also help you choose flowers to convey platonic or romantic lovemany floral designers provide a host of services to meet customer demand throughout the yearprearrangements most florists whether they work at a chain or independent flower shop both online or in a brickandmortar store offer prearrangements of flowers this means the floral designer has a selection of roses tulips and other popular kinds of blossoms designed in arrangement that customers can simply buy on the spot instead of telling the florist what kind of flower pattern they wanthave you ever purchased a getwell basket featuring sunflowers or an array of springtime flowers for mothers day if so you most likely bought a prearrangement that the floral designer put together ahead of timebuying a prearranged bouquet is a great option if you dont know what blooms or plants to purchase but you need flowers for a particular occasionpredesigned arrangements are not original oneofakind designs but the upside to buying prearrangements is they already come with a fixed price attached customers may simply walk in and spend  on a valentines day bouquet as opposed to paying the florist a commission for an original design that could fetch a much higher pricecustommade arrangements having both an eye for design as well as good people and customer service skills is a must for any florist these professionals work with clients to find the best flowers and customdesigned arrangements appropriate for the event or occasion a commission to create a table piece wreath or other type of design is typically much more expensive than a prearrangement as it may not be made up of plants the florist already has on handevents and occasionstheres always a demand for florists and their creations yearround as people celebrate and commemorate the special moments in their lives whether youre getting married or remembering a loved one that just passed flower arrangements and wreaths are traditional items we all use to help mark the important dates stages and occasions in our livesweddings one type of event most floral designers work on is weddings professional florists will collaborate with the bride and groom to formulate a design scheme that complements the events overall colors and layout depending on what the couple wants and can afford a floral designer may create the bridal bouquet along with streams of flowers for the wedding venue table arrangements and vases for the reception afterwardthe prices for hiring a florist to do a wedding vary broadly because it not only depends on how many blooming plants you want but also how widely available the particular flowers are more exotic types of blossoms such as orchids are pricier than your typical rose your bill could also fluctuate depending on how complicated the design is to make and if the flowers you choose are in season or notkeeping that in mind florists are like any other tradesperson  your bill will reflect the materials they used and the time and labor that went into making up the designssome floral designers also charge delivery fees to transport the flowers vases and other materials to wedding or reception sites remember its not only the bride that needs flowers bridesmaids and the mother of the bride might also carry corsages and the groom and groomsmen sometimes festoon their jackets with boutonnieres dont forget about the flower girl as wellin all the average cost to outfit a wedding with flowers is about  some florists advise people to set aside  to  percent of the ceremonys budget for floral decorationsfunerals funerals are another major life event we commemorate with flowers florists may furnish sympathy flowers for the observance and lay sprays or baskets of plants around the church synagogue or funeral home to help attendees with the grieving process designers also make floral wreaths and crosses to set up at the venue or in the cemetery as well as special casket arrangements so family and friends may show their respect for the deceasedmany customers choose traditional roses lilies and carnations to send to a bereaved family but florists are also able to personalize arrangements to your likingjust like other ceremonies that call for flowers the price depends on the number of blossoms and what type of plants you want along with the complexity of the arrangement a complete funeral floral package that includes sprays along the casket flower decorations for the venue and flowers for the participants can run from  to meanwhile the usual sympathy bouquet or vase runs between  and mothers day you might think valentines day would be the busiest day for a florist but the day of love comes in second place behind mothers day according to a number of studies people do more online searches for flowers in anticipation of the may holiday than they do for valentines dayin fact this day is inextricably linked with flowers as congress first issued a mothers day proclamation in  asking all federal officials to wear a white carnation to commemorate their mothersmany children wish their mothers well on the day by sending a bouquet of carnations roses violets or tulipsvalentines day coming in second place as the busiest holiday for florists is valentines day when feb  arrives so do many people looking for arrangements to send to their loved ones just like mothers day this holiday is very lucrative for floral designers americans typically spend tens of millions of dollars on their significant others every feb  and flowers especially longstemmed red roses are a popular way to show someone you carevalentines day goes to show that a gift of freshcut flowers never goes out of style however it does go up in price  quite a lot actually the price of a bouquet of roses usually doubles on feb  before it goes back down the next business day expect to pay up to  for red roses from a flower shop on valentines day therefore if youre looking for a deal its smart to buy your bouquets a few days ahead of time and keep them in a vase with water so they stay freshthanksgiving christmas and hanukkah the holiday season is also one known for festive floral arrangements many families look to florists to come up with a thanksgiving table set piece or a traditional cornucopia featuring plants with autumnal colors and gourds many churches and individuals also spring for flowering plants to help usher in christmastime many florists sell living yuletide decorative plants such as ivy holly poinsettias mistletoe and even miniature christmas treesmany flower shops and floral arrangers also design centerpieces especially for the eight nights of hanukkah online and brickandmortar florists offer blue and white flowers usually arranged with candles in between the blossomseaster and passover religious holidays held in spring also keep flower shops busy as they design orders for families churches and synagogues many shoppers are on the lookout for bunches of mixed flowers prearranged in bouquets or vases by florists lilies as well as daffodils and tulips are especially popular around these spring holidayshindu and buddhist ceremonies flowers especially the lotus figure prominently in hindu and buddhist religious ceremonies as well as in these two ancient religions wedding customs many florists provide garlands of flowers to decorate and festoon the functions withother occasions remember that it doesnt need to be a holiday to purchase flowers floral designers also make commissioned or prearranged flowers to take to sick relatives friends and colleagues recovering at home or in the hospital many florists also make designs for newborn babies toowhat else a florist can help you withwhile the majority of their work is devoted to making eyecatching and pleasing creations with plants florists can help you with much more than just finding the right flowers for your next event or partyin fact a good floral designer can be a fountain of knowledge these experts can inform you of the best ways to take care of your plants or how to properly cut the stems of flowers to ensure they last longer in your vasethe next time youre out buying an arrangement ask your florist which type of vase to use with which flower and how much water and plant food you should use to prolong the life of your bouquet or potted plant even though retail florists dont usually grow the blooms or plants themselves they do know the best ways to keep your arrangement looking fresh for longeronline florists versus local shopslocal flower shops or gardening stores used to be the only game in town when it came to selling real or fake floral arrangements until supermarkets and drugstore chains entered the business by offering inexpensive prearrangements for holidays and other occasions however the number of brickandmortar florists is further on the decline as more customers choose to purchase bouquets wreaths and other greenery onlineeven though one exists in a virtual capacity while the other is located in a physical setting there arent too many differences between online and brickandmortar flower shopsmany online stores offer prearrangements of flowers you can purchase as well as the ability to form your own design and decorationonline flower shops in fact work with wholesale florists near your area to ensure they deliver your order promptly since cut flowers dont have a long shelf life these internetbased companies essentially take your request and contract it out to a florist in your locale to design it and drop it off at your home or officewhile purchasing flowers online is convenient  you can shop any time of the day without leaving your house  there are a few things the online stores cannot offer patrons you cant smell the sweet fragrance of tulips or roses in cyberspace and you cant touch the petals or leaves before you buy the plant additionally when you buy a bouquet over the internet youre basing your decision on a stock photo of the item instead of the actual one that will arrive at your doorstepnot all varieties of roses or violets look the same and an approximation of a flower isnt the same as the specific one you could end up receivingthis is one advantage physical brickandmortar flower shops have over their online competitors making the trip to your local florist means you can actually get the chance to stop and smell the roses we just redesigned ypcom do you like it× likenot a fan× thank youfeedback milmont
