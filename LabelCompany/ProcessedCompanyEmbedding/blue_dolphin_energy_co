events for additional disclosures related to our longterm debt and financial covenant violations blue dolphin energy company form q  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued major influences on results of operations our earnings and cash flows from our refinery operations business segment are primarily affected by the relationship between refined petroleum product prices and the prices for crude oil and other feedstocks crude oil refining is primarily a marginbased business and in order to increase profitability it is important for a refinery to maximize the yields of higher value finished and intermediate products and to minimize the costs of feedstock and operating expenses our cost to acquire crude oil and condensate and the price for which our refined petroleum products are ultimately sold depend on several factors many of which are beyond our control including the supply of and demand for crude oil and refined petroleum products which depend on changes in domestic and foreign economies weather conditions domestic and foreign political affairs production levels availability of and access to transportation infrastructure the availability of imports the marketing of competitive fuel and governmental regulations among other factors crude oil and refined petroleum product prices are also affected by other factors such as local and general market conditions and the operating levels of competing refineries crude oil costs and the prices of refined petroleum products have historically been subject to wide fluctuations an expansion or upgrade of our competitors facilities price volatility international political and economic developments and other factors beyond our control are likely to continue to play an important role in crude oil refining industry economics moreover the refining industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand for refined petroleum products such as increases in the demand for gasoline during the summer driving season and for home heating oil during the winter these factors can impact among other things the level of inventories in the market resulting in price volatility and a negative impact on product margins in addition to current market conditions there are longterm factors that may impact the demand for refined petroleum products these factors include mandated renewable fuels standards proposed climate change laws and regulations and increased mileage standards for vehicles key relationships relationship with leh we currently rely on operations payments and our profit share under the joint marketing agreement and advances from leh to fund our working capital requirements if gel does not advance operations payments and the profit share is insufficient to fund our working capital requirements leh may but is not required to fund our working capital requirements there can be no assurances that leh will continue to fund our

in significant refinery downtime and a significant decrease in refinery throughput refinery production and refined petroleum product sales for the nine months ended september   although gel resumed normal delivery of crude oil and condensate to the nixon facility in july  the adverse change in our relationship with genesis has had a material adverse effect on our operations liquidity and
