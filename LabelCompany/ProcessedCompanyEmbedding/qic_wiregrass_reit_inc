you saw in our earnings release we continue to execute on strategy as reflected by both solid results from our portfolio and transactions that will raise significant equity contribute to greater focus and further debt reduction as we prepare for reit conversionoperating ffo per share was up  for the quarter and  yeartodate compared to the same period last year the biggest drivers of those gains were increased noi from the mature portfolio increased operating ffo from new properties and new openings and acquisitions and lower interest expense here again each of those drivers is very much in line with the continued execution our strategiescomp noi and occupancies were up across all major asset classes in our regional malls were seeing positive impact of the strong samespace leasing spreads weve been reporting as a result of our renovation expansion and remerchandising programs in the third quarter those spreads were up  on a rolling month basis the sixth consecutive quarter with spreads above  in our mallsoffice results reflect ongoing strength in our life science portfolio including the leaseup  sidney at university park at mit which we reported last quarter as well as strong demanding in key markets particularly brooklyn apartments continue to post positive gains with thirdquarter results reflecting increased competition as new supply comes in line in a number of our sub markets while that new supply is being absorbed we expected more modest results in the near to midterm with somewhat lower noi growth than our averages over the past couple of years longer term we believe our properties are located in some of the strongest markets in the country with good demographics and solid longterm growth outlooks bob will share more details on our results later in the callread moreill turn now to the transactions we announced with our earnings we expect these and others still in the works will continue to focus our business and generate capital to drive continued progress towards our deleveraging goals in line with the strategy we shared with investors back in mayfirst at westchesters ridge hill regional mall in yonkers new york we are commencing site work to bring the home improvement retailer lowes to the center on a acre parcel at the southern end of the project we expect to have a signed lease in the near future we believe that together with other recent new tenants the addition of lowes puts ridge on a solid path to stabilizationwith that milestone we have reached an agreement qic under which we expect to expand our existing regional mall joint ventures to include ridge hill in the fourth quarter in addition we plan to add the shops at wiregrass near tampa and ballston commons in arlington virginia to our qic joint ventures in the first half of  our relationship with qic has been a great success to date and were seeing positive impact on our retail results as we invest together to further improve the centers in the portfoliobringing these three additional centers into the qic joint venture portfolio is expected to generate net proceeds with approximately  million as a result of the agreements that include ridge hill and our qic joint venture we recognized a  million noncash impairment of that asset during this quarter the impairment reflects the challenges the center has faced including opening into a piece of the great recession importantly though ridge hill now has considerable positive momentum is achieving sales per square foot well above of our regional mall average and fits into the quality mall portfolio we own with qicwe also now after receiving multiple offers from interested parties and conducting a competitive bidding process we have negotiated an agreement in principal to sell our military housing business to the hunt companies a significant player in the military housing space we expect to execute a purchase agreement in the near future and are targeting a closing subject to appropriate consents and closing conditions by yearend expected proceeds from the disposition of this business is approximately  millionin addition in brooklyn we have executed purchase agreements with the rabsky group for the sale of  fulton street a development site adjacent to our dklb bkln apartment community we expect the sale of this property which is unencumbered to generate gross proceeds of approximately  million that pricing represents roughly  per square foot based upon current zoningin total these transactions the three new qic joint ventures the disposition of the military housing business and  fulton are expected to result in total net proceeds of approximately  million in line with the strategies we presented to investors in may we are pleased that we have identified and are working to close opportunities representing a significant portion of the equity needed for our transformation we remain fully focused on pursuing the remaining noncore dispositions we will provide additional updates on each of these transactions as they close of course there can be no assurance that we will be able to close all or any of these ongoing transactions mentioned on this call or in our earnings release nonetheless we remain confident in our ability to continue to execute our strategies to focus our business further delever and activate growth opportunities with our strategic partnersthere were two other impairments in the quarter that i should comment on the first of our illinois science and technology park in skokie illinois where we recorded an impairments of  million or  million net of tax the other impairment which impacted ffo results was on land in downtown las vegas where we recognized impairment of  million we are actively marketing both of these assets and have revised our valuation assumptions based upon negotiations with prospective buyers also in our earnings we noted that after the end of the quarter we closed financing on the redevelopment of nassaus veteran memorial coliseum and brought onexim sports and entertainment into that partnership as an  majority partnerbefore i turn the call over to bob i just want to thank shareholders for the support they showed by approving all proposals put forth for the vote related to our planned reit conversion at the special shareholder meeting held on october  with that ill turn it over to bobbob obrien forest city enterprises inc  cfo thanks steve good morning everybodyim going to begin this morning by walking through our thirdquarter operating ffo bridge which can be found on page  of the supplemental package the bridge begins on the lefthand side with our thirdquarter  operating ffo of  million moving to the right our offo results for this years third quarter were positively impacted by increased operating ffo from new property openings and acquisitions of  million with much of that gain coming from our acquisition in june of our former partners interest in university park at mitnext is decrease expense of  million including both corporate and propertylevel interest increased noi from the mature portfolio of  million increased ffo from a variety of other sources of  million increased capitalized interest of  million as we have activated new development projects increased offo from land sales at stapleton of  million and increased offo from military housing of  millionthese positives were partially offset by lower offo from property sold of  million resulting in thirdquarter operating ffo of  million or  per share a  increase over offo per share in the third quarter last year overall as dave pointed out it was another solid quarter and reflects the positive impact of our continuing execution of our strategiesour team is continuing to put forth the extraordinary efforts needed to achieve our goal of reit conversion as of the beginning of the new year as dave indicated there are a number of pending and potential joint ventures and sales transaction that we are targeting to close by yearend each of these transactions will have a meaningful impact on our taxable income or loss for the year and will have a material effect on our cumulative earnings and profit calculation as of the military housing and  fulton sales will generate significant taxable gains while the ridge hill joint venture when closed will result in a taxable loss we are working diligently to minimize the tax and ep impact these transactions have on the company youll note in our filings we changed the assumptions about the range of any potential ep distributions to less than  million if anygiven the volume of transactions and the potential for the timing and the closing of these transactions to shift between  and  we would expect to make the required ep distribution should there be one sometime in early  you will also note in our construction pipeline in the supplemental package youll see cost increases of approximately  million for b in brooklynthese increases reflect a more complete assessment of construction conditions in the field including the degree of completion of units already at the building site and those remaining in the factory we also experienced greater delays than anticipated and costs related to rehiring or replacing talent that was let go when our former partners separated from the project we have made significant progress in the factory and at the site and our team is very focused on completing this projectas we indicated in our filings we are finalizing the negotiation of a new line of credit for the company terms of the new line will better align with our new structure as a reit and reflect the significant progress we have made thus far improving our balance sheet and our risk profileone last thing i certainly hope our investors recognize as i do that there is much to be done between now and the end of the year i know that our teams are focused on our nearterm objective and the good news is that our goals are in sight and achievable i want to acknowledge their efforts and thank all our of stakeholders for their supportlet me turn it back to you davedavid larue forest city enterprises inc  president  ceo thanks bob our press release and filings contain information on our projects under construction i will take the time now to talk about the specific projects but we would be happy to address any questions during qa in september we announced that we would move to a new organizational structure to better align with our strategies enhance efficiency and help us achieve our targeted margin improvementour teams are nearing completion of the planning and design for the new organization with execution in  and a steadystate goal in  the new structure will be a key driver in meeting and exceeding our targeted annual cost savings and margin improvement we outlined back in may in summary our thirdquarter and yeartodate results showed solid momentum in our portfoliowe continue to execute on strategy including growth from core product and stronger the markets improving our balance sheet debt metrics and activating new developments the transactions we have announced will help accelerate our transformation including significant additional debt reduction with shareholder approval of the proposals related to our conversion to reit status we have passed another milestone in our journey as a company and are confident in our outlook and ability to deliver value for all stakeholdersbefore we go to your questions id like to say special thank you to our associates and advisors between reit conversion and our organizational structural changes to say nothing of the daytoday work of running a successful business its hard to overstate the efforts that our teams and in particular our legal tax it finance accounting and operating teams have put forth and continue to put forth to make sure our transformation is a reality that effort is deeply appreciated and i thank all of our associates for the dedication and hard workwith that lets go your questionsquestions and answersoperator operator instructionssheila mcgrath evercore isisheila mcgrath evercore isi  analyst good morning bob or dave could you tell us approximately if you sum up all these dispositions with a  million net proceeds and also the debt that might go to your partners on the jv where this gets to on a net debttoebitda basisbob obrien forest city enterprises inc  cfo sheila ill take that good question we said at the end of the  or last quarter at about  if you annualize that for the qic acquisition its really about  we think that the transactions we announced together with using the proceeds to pay down debt absent any other changes will reduce that back by a  turn so just high ssheila mcgrath evercore isi  analyst high s okay great and then on the impairment on ridge hill in your explanation of it this is helping to shelter gains and minimize the ep distribution is that accurate is that how the ep is going lowerbob obrien forest city enterprises inc  cfo short answer to that is yes the impairment was a results of our decision to enter into the joint venture with qic when we changed the hold period and knew we were going to transact or increased the probability we would transact on that thats what triggered the impairment for gaap purposesthe tax loss will be realized and there is one here when we close were obviously pushing to get that closed this year its substantial similar in amount to the impairment we took obviously that would reduce our cumulative earnings and profits as well so if we can successfully close that this year that will dramatically lower on potentially  ep purge  potentially to zerosheila mcgrath evercore isi  analyst okay one last question just on  everyone was probably pleasantly surprised on the value of the residential parcel as well as military housing but there was no real update on the nets and the arena but in the q the forbearance date changed so i wonder if you could just explain what that date means how much that is and where you are in the process of those discussionsdavid larue forest city enterprises inc  president  ceo sheila thank you for the question this is dave again with all of our noncore asset and again weve talk again about this particular asset being a core asset but not for our company because its the operation of the arena and an nba sports team we continued to make progress and have discussions i wouldnt look too much into the dates that are and therewe continue to advance discussions on the nets and the arena along with other assets as i said during my comments were going to remain focused on transacting those because we understand the importance of the transactions on the simplification of our business and our story the capital that can be raised and just getting to where we want to end up with that portfolio that is going to be the main basis of value the value proposition that we look forward tosheila mcgrath evercore isi  analyst okay great thank youoperator christy mcelroy citichristy mcelroy citigroup  analyst hi good morning thanks dave just following up on the recently announced organizational changes now that they have been detailed can you update us on your estimate for cost savings previously it was a range of  million to  million can you also provide some additional details around the level of ga savings versus expected operating margin improvement theredavid larue forest city enterprises inc  president  ceo hi christy thanks for the question we are comfortable that we are  again we dont have any final specific targets that we are in the range still more towards the mid to upper part of that range as we are looking at the plans come together now the breakdown between what ga and what is going to pass through the allocation system to the properties has not yet been finalizedso were hoping by our next quarterly call after we have had that budget complete that we see the impact of the savings roll through our model so to speak and different partnerships we will be able to give you more insight into how that broke down between ga and property noi enhancementchristy mcelroy citigroup  analyst okay with regard to the ridge hill contribution in q since its the most immediate as we think about it from a modeling standpoint how much retail noi will you lose in the sale in thinking about it in the context of your stabilized noi estimate of  million whats the time frame for reaching that stabilized noi now that you have visibility on the lowes dealbob obrien forest city enterprises inc  cfo christy its bob with respect to ridge hills impact in the fourth quarter i would expect that that would close  the joint venture  if we can get it closed this year well close late this year so we will have a modest if any impact really on the current run rate of noi at the center lowes as dave indicated is coming but the lease is not yet signed that will happen sometime presumably in  or early  so were on a glide path to get to that  million of noi and thats expect to stabilize in christy mcelroy citigroup  analyst so then what will be the impact on q thenbob obrien forest city enterprises inc  cfo well you can expect that qic will be in the goal is to get them in by the first quarter so as i indicated were trying to get that closed this year so they would be in for the full first quarter so you can look at our quarterly run rate that should improve as occupancy continues to improve but they will be taking roughly onehalf of thatchristy mcelroy citigroup  analyst okay youve said in the past that with the reit conversion you would be willing to start providing possibly ffo and other guidance would you expect to do that for  can you update us on thatdavid larue forest city enterprises inc  president  ceo that is something that weve talked about weve considered as youve noted in your own comments about the quarter we have some choppier results because of the transactions what were evaluating is as we look forward how can we get to a steadystate operating numberas these transactions close as we make progress on some of these still major transactions that we havent announced that we are working on it will give us a better idea when we can get to providing guidance regarding operating ffo or ffo et cetera in line with other peers do in the marketplace but during this transformation and again as i said its going to go through  until we get to a steadystate at the right point we will be able to give with confidence those numberschristy mcelroy citigroup  analyst right especially as youre moving through these transactions some guidance on the movement in ffo would be extremely helpful and then just lastly for me have you finalized dividend policy what are you expecting now that were getting closer to david larue forest city enterprises inc  president  ceo we have not  again thats a decision the board makes were going to have a board meeting later this month as we discussed with a number of new investors and analysts and internally we believe that for forest city realty trust that the correct dividend policy will be to pay what is required per the reit statute which is close to our taxable income getting that rangecontinue to use excess capital generated from the portfolio to address our other strategic initiatives deleveraging and other needs in the business so we hope to have an answer to that again clearly by our february meeting we will have to declare what that dividend is but if we make a decision sooner we will obviously announce that after the board meetingchristy mcelroy citigroup  analyst thank youdavid larue forest city enterprises inc  president  ceo thank youoperator george auerbach credit suissegeorge auerbach credit suisse  analyst thanks good morning on the mall sales and understanding that you had the qic venture already set up and that they had to have a appetite to grow that venture with you but going forward has your appetite changed at all to sell more stabilized core asset in addition to noncore assets or was this a oneoff transactiondavid larue forest city enterprises inc  president  ceo george thanks for the question again qic is a series of joint ventures it is just not one each one of the properties is a separate joint venture just clarifying that its not all in one but similar structures in each i dont think our appetite has changed regarding core assetsif we look at the makeup of each one of these the characteristics of each asset ridge hill again we were able to get a lowes deal done we were able to again make a decision on stabilization we changed our whole period it made sense for us to look for a partner and they were most likely as you can tell the logical partner for us because we believe in the longterm value of ridge hill and putting it in the portfolio is beneficial  putting in into their strategic portfolio is beneficial to us and themballston weve talked about the complete renovation and repurposing opportunities at ballston again they are investing in a partial operating assets but more investing in the future then just so from a risk standpoint and having again a strong capital partner that understands the real estate business during a redevelopment is beneficial to us as well so we can begin to appropriately allocating capital our share of capital spending redevelopment at the same time focusing capital on other investment opportunitiesand then with regard to wiregrass as we were looking at the portfolio it was something we have been talking about during the last string and we just couldnt get to the value equations at that point and the property has improved over time and we were able to get to an agreedupon value between us so each had its own different characteristic with regard to the regional mall portfolio and again that should be the partnership makes sense for uswith regard to any other assets any other core asset as we said many times our focus is on the noncore we realize there is significant value in core asset sales today but we believe longterm the type of properties we want to own and operate and grow value from some of the core properties would be nonreplaceable for us so we want to maintain a hold on our great assets and again focus on the assets that weve stated and are out there in the marketplace trying to marketgeorge auerbach credit suisse  analyst thats helpful especially on the ballston comments on that theme as you think about south bay galleria redevelopment in the future could that asset also be a candidate for a qic venture just as you look to bring in capital partnerdavid larue forest city enterprises inc  president  ceo thats already in the venture that was put in back in september of  i believe was when we closed so thats already in again they are fully committed to the repurposing and redevelopment of that and again that will fit beyond their knowledge of redevelopment of properties their partnership from a financial standpoint is also beneficialgeorge auerbach credit suisse  analyst okay last one for me the noi margins have already started to tick higher this year up about  basis points yearoveryear are there any expense savings reflected in those numbers or is the margin improvement simply a reflection of the samestore noi growth and the mix of assetsdavid larue forest city enterprises inc  president  ceo so george if i understand the question youre asking if there is some savings already showing up in the operating marginsgeorge auerbach credit suisse  analyst yesdavid larue forest city enterprises inc  president  ceo yes what we have done is weve started again this process with our advisors and our internal review of our structure and our costs and things that we are able to execute on without impacting  because we dont have that final plan done  we have taken action onsome of that margin improvement is showing up this year but again as we  as i stated earlier once we finalize that plan and start executing through  that steadystate and again all of that operating margin expansion will show up in a steadystate more in  but there is some of that happening this year alreadygeorge auerbach credit suisse  analyst thats great thank youoperator brad burke goldman sachsbrad burke goldman sachs  analyst hey good morning guys followup to sheilas question bob just thinking about your question on debttoebitda i think you said that youre going to get the high s post the asset sales but that also assumes that youve fully redeploying net proceeds into debt repayment and as i look at your development pipeline you have just under  million remaining to fund thereso a twopart question first how youre feeling about getting the   times leverage level that you laid out previously then second how youre thinking about funding that development pipeline if the base case assumption is that youll use sales proceeds for deleveragingbob obrien forest city enterprises inc  cfo a couple things obviously our leverage bridge that we shared with investors back in may had a number of components i know asset sales was a significant but certainly not the only component there so my response to sheila  i should have said was mid to upper s based on the transactions announced is really what i wanted to  i should have emphasize and again you are right assuming we use  of those proceeds to reduce leverageyoure also right that we have obligations related to that construction pipeline a significant portion of which  of the remaining funding is debt but there is probably  million to  million of equity obligations that we have to fund our share in that pipeline that identified it from both cash flow from operations as well as incremental asset salesas dave indicated in his prepared remarks and as well as afterwards theres more to come were focused on executing the strategies that we laid out that includes some additional noncore asset sales weve given ourselves the time and laid out a timeline under which we think we can get that donethe announcement we were making with our release yesterday and the discussion today goes a long way to getting there but theres still a lot of work to be done so its really going to be the debt reduction and the funding of that equity the majority of the funding of the equity requirements in the construction pipeline are coming from these asset sales but a portion is coming from the ongoing cash flow from the business as wellbrad burke goldman sachs  analyst so if i think about the development  your comments that only about  million of equity and the remainder would debt that works out to the better part of  million of debt that youd be taking on to fund those developments inclusive of that increase in debt you still feel like the glide path that you laid out previously is reasonable over the timeline that you had indicateddavid larue forest city enterprises inc  president  ceo yes because obviously over  particularly in  and into  well be opening a number of these and those will be additive to our noi you see particularly on the commercial side the preleasing on the office stuff that will add immediately obviously residential will ramp up over timeso again the components to get to that  to  times are numerous and includes the conversion of our converts there is additional debt reduction from noncore asset sales that will come theres a margin improvement that weve been talking about and were focused on all those but the bottom line is yes we are focused on getting to that  to  times and then confident we are going to get there within the time frame we articulatedbrad burke goldman sachs  analyst okay then i realize that you have a lot of moving parts but i was hoping for some additional color on what drove the big increase in adjusted ebitda from the second quarter you obviously had the fullquarter contribution from mit i estimate thats maybe  million  million of sequential improvement but otherwise arena senior housing military housing land development it looks like were all down sequentially so i was just trying to understand what would be driving such a big increase sequentiallybob obrien forest city enterprises inc  cfo yes actually land was up ill have to check that the big difference quarteroverquarter was there was a fairly sizable project right off last quarter that didnt recur this quarter thats one of the bigger driver for the two and mit is a significant component as you identifybrad burke goldman sachs  analyst and that project right off was captured in q adjusted ebitdabob obrien forest city enterprises inc  cfo yesbrad burke goldman sachs  analyst okay and then the last one for me i appreciate the color on b but since youre doing so much on development i was just hoping for your comments on how youre thinking about construction cost escalation risk and what youre seeing on the ground in your marketsdavid larue forest city enterprises inc  president  ceo brad thanks for the question that is a real occurrence that is happening we see it each time we go to the market in each of our core markets that there is greater demand for the service that is being offered so therefore there is an increase in cost occurrence the strength of the markets that were building in so far has been able to absorb that costagain weve talked about in the past the nature of our development projects based upon where were at from a cost perspective when we start when we have a final contract in place and final drawings in measuring the potential income we make the decision to go forward and if that doesnt balance because these projects arent the sizable projects that we had when we went in they are not  million or  million projects theyre much more compactwe have equity partners and development partners taking that risk with us and disbursed across markets we think that from a risk standpoint we have that balance and at the same time we see that cost escalating faster than market rents would allow us to get a return we can make the choice not to proceed so its just a different makeup of the development portfolio that helps us deal with that cost increase which again as you noted we are seeingbrad burke goldman sachs  analyst are you able to give a broad strokes percentage increase yearoveryear what youre seeing on the ground across the portfolio on construction costs maybe eliminating some of the idiosyncratic that  happening at bdavid larue forest city enterprises inc  president  ceo i dont off the top of my head brad have that number because new york is different than washington just a fact based upon labor conditions denver is different than san francisco and los angeles i dont have it off the top of my head and i wouldnt want to guess as were on the callbrad burke goldman sachs  analyst no that is fair enough thank you very muchdavid larue forest city enterprises inc  president  ceo all right thanks bradoperator jamie feldman bank of america merrill lynchjamie feldman bofa merrill lynch  analyst thank you and good morning you had commented on the outset of the call that you are seeing more challenging conditions in brooklyn on the residential side can you just provide more color on what youre seeing on the grounddavid larue forest city enterprises inc  president  ceo yes what i was talking about not so much brooklyn but i was talking about new supply coming into some of our submarkets is more focused jamie on just the east coast where we are developing product in new york and we just did  were opening dc we opened  and have another building under development that will be opening soonas we look across that east coast market in our submarkets particular as i said we see buildings opening and even against ourselves at the yards in washington for example impacting our revenue we are pretty standard  pretty much in line with our expense increases and were focused on keeping those expenses under control but new supply is coming into the market and it has impacted that noi to the  and again that mostly on that east coast portfolio for usjamie feldman bofa merrill lynch  analyst okay and just to gauge your  is this a change in view from last quarter is it materially worse than you thought it would be heading into the third quarterbob obrien forest city enterprises inc  cfo no its pretty much in line with where we thought it was going to be more important rather than quartertoquarter if we look at where we are yeartodate yeartodate were still well about   the markets have been resilient and pricing has been in the landlords favor in the markets because of demand in each of these markets where we have productso it was just the particulars with just the buildings opening in our sub markets that has caused this more of a downtrend we expect that will continue in the near term as i said as these buildings continue to lease up the competitors buildings continue to lease up but again longterm the strength of the markets we think is going to continue to rule the day and we are going to be able to take advantage of the strength in that rentable sectorjamie feldman bofa merrill lynch  analyst okay and does this change or appetite for starts or maybe push out stabilization on any of your assets that are in the pipelinedavid larue forest city enterprises inc  president  ceo yes we dont see pushing out stabilization at this point again well feel that when we actually start opening these buildings and leasing them more in  but again were going to be focused on whether or not our appetite should change and as i addressed in the previous question the makeup of our portfolio is going to allow us to make that choice based upon current informationand that includes a new supply into the marketplace a new demand into the marketplace and construction costs and how that all impacting returns so we will remain vigilant and make sure we are careful about where we are allocating capital in that regard to that growth opportunityjamie feldman bofa merrill lynch  analyst okay and then can you just address office leasing spreads they were pretty light in the third quarter what should people be expecting going forwardbob obrien forest city enterprises inc  cfo the third quarter is more of an anomaly compared to where weve been were in the plus yearoveryear versus relatively flat in this quarter so it all depends what particular leases rolled that quarter where they were at versus what we signed back up so its just maybe a tough quarterly comparisonjamie feldman bofa merrill lynch  analyst okay similar question you had an occupancy dip in both retail and office multiple speakersbob obrien forest city enterprises inc  cfo very minor reduction  and  or something again thats more just an anomaly versus anything major as i said the markets where our office value sits in new york and cambridge continued to see increases in demand increases in tenant demand and revenue so again where our assets are positioned in the markets are in a strong place and we will be able to capture that strength as leases come upjamie feldman bofa merrill lynch  analyst okay and then weve been hearing a lot about gsa requirements over the next several years in dc do you have a sense of what that might mean for your development pipeline or opportunities where you have landdavid larue forest city enterprises inc  president  ceo well again we have in washington our yards project entitlement for  million squarefeet of office space we believe that we are creating a superior unique location for office users that is unlike any other one in the district where you can have an environment that is not just office and close to capitol hill and convenient to metro and public transportation and so as gsa goes out into the marketplace we think were going to be able to be competitive and realize value that is tied up  that we have there in the land and bring value to the stockholdersagain we will look at the deal see if it makes sense for us to do judge the size of it if we have the capacity to do it ourselves we will and if it is too large because it end up being a sizable deal theres  we have a history of making sure that we balance that risk and size against what the opportunity isjamie feldman bofa merrill lynch  analyst do you have an early sense of when we will start to see those commitments come out  or the rfps come updavid larue forest city enterprises inc  president  ceo no again there are some requests and some deals floating around the washington market right now so again i cant say when the rest of them will come out but there are some active gsa deals currently in the marketplace that were aware of and were having discussions aboutjamie feldman bofa merrill lynch  analyst okay and then just my last question the nets arena and even some of your legacy midwest assets the market seems pretty anxious to see those get sold can you just give us maybe a realistic time frame of as we head into  is this something we could see earlier or is this going to really take a whiledavid larue forest city enterprises inc  president  ceo jamie again the market is anxious about everything were doing i hope that the announcements that weve made answer a lot of the questions and pushback weve gotten over the last number of meetings and discussions weve had with investors and analysts whether or not we were committed to making the transactions occur on selling these this quarter clearly demonstrates that we have been focused and making progressso those assets that you mentioned again arent in the long term we anticipate near to midterm announcements and if those arent going to happen we will tell you they are not going to happen and why but at this point things that we have talked about transacting were having discussions on and when theyre ready to announce well do that and it will be near to midterm not its just going to sit on the balance sheet until we get around to itjamie feldman bofa merrill lynch  analyst okay thanks for the coloroperator christy mcelroy citimichael bilerman citigroup  analyst hey its michael bilerman i just had a couple of questions bob thanks for the cost incurred to date on page  on the development pipelinebob obrien forest city enterprises inc  cfo see we are listening a little were slow michael but were listeningmichael bilerman citigroup  analyst so now all we need is construction loans by project in terms of total amount and amounts drawn and ultimately this will be a fight for the next few years yields by type or by project which would be helpful but i wanted to thank you at least for putting these costs incurred to date inbob obrien forest city enterprises inc  cfo appreciate that were keeping a list michaelmichael bilerman citigroup  analyst as we think about the qic assets if you were to take your noi from page  you look at your mall noi  million in the third quarter so an annualized about  million and a stabilized number of  million which i assume includes the  million from ridge hill how much current noi is there from the three projects and how much stabilized noi is there from the three projectsbob obrien forest city enterprises inc  cfo im not going to give you the current noi on that and dave tried to articulate to one of the questions georges question on the malls that ridge hill has been in transition weve highlighted that specifically given its size and magnitude to the company and the timeline for us to get there as i said should stabilized in  the other two are in some form of transitionwiregrass is a little closer to stabilization as it currently exists there is an actual small project adding a theater and some an additional restaurant and retail at a site right adjacent to the mall that qic will be part of as well so they are buying in not only to the existing center but the opportunities that exist adjacent to thatthen ballston in arlington is undergoing a pretty sizeable and significant transformation really opening up the center to the outside really a significant transformation of the tenancy to really reflect what it is which is its going to continue to be a great urban center in the middle of what has grown up to be a great downtownso you can  we talked last night via email the cap rate that qic is paying to come into ridge hill is relatively straightforward and obvious given the disclosures weve made im more aggressive on the other assets because of where they are and where they sit in their lifemichael bilerman citigroup  analyst we just dont know from a current basis what noi we have to strip out as this venture unfolded arguably all three of these assets have some issues on a current basis but eventually will stabilize to a much higher noi from a transaction basis it would be really helpful to know the current noi that these projects are generatingotherwise you can say where debttoebitda goes but if we dont know  we know the debt there is  million of debt of the three projects gross asset value for the venture is about  million just imputing the  million gross so we know the debt and we dont the ebitda though so it would be helpful to get that numberbob obrien forest city enterprises inc  cfo okay we will take it under advisement i agree with youmichael bilerman citigroup  analyst is there any fees  i remember this was circled when you did the internalization with bruce is there any other fees going out for ridge hill to himdavid larue forest city enterprises inc  president  ceo any additional fees as a result this transaction nomichael bilerman citigroup  analyst no and then what was the changes  if i remember correctly you had the  yield on  million of cost which would be about  million of noi it is now listed at  million i dont know of the lowes ground lease affected that difference or was there a revision overall to the projects ultimate occupancy and rent levels that would have caused the noi to be different from what you had previously discloseddavid larue forest city enterprises inc  president  ceo michael it is a majority of the transaction were doing with lowes but there are other factors in there as we look into stabilization it is where we came to an agreement with what that stabilized number was going to be with qic we put it on the page so its across again  more tilted toward the big deal on the  acres but also the other expectations as we move forwardmichael bilerman citigroup  analyst does the  million of cash youre getting in does that include any funding for ballston or wiregrass or any build out at ridge hill or is that truly just standalone today as the assets and then you will cofunded  any future capital commitmentsdavid larue forest city enterprises inc  president  ceo its the latter were going to  that will be the money we get in and going forward we will be jv partners on our ownership interest and funding partnersmichael bilerman citigroup  analyst okay just last two was there any seller financing or any debt on the military housing business so that  million is a gross or is that an equity number as we think about valuedavid larue forest city enterprises inc  president  ceo that is the equity that we will be taking onmichael bilerman citigroup  analyst and how much debt is going along with military housingbob obrien forest city enterprises inc  cfo on our balance sheet about  millionmichael bilerman citigroup  analyst  millionbob obrien forest city enterprises inc  cfo  millionmichael bilerman citigroup  analyst  million and then there was no debt on  fulton rightbob obrien forest city enterprises inc  cfo thats correctmichael bilerman citigroup  analyst okay perfect thank youbob obrien forest city enterprises inc  cfo thanks michaeloperator i would now like to turn the call back over to mr larue for closing remarksdavid larue forest city enterprises inc  president  ceo thank you thank you all for your questions and your participation in the call as we reflect on how much progress we were able to announce this quarter i think back to the comments bob has made during numerous investor meeting where we keep telling whoever we are meeting with that were like the duck underwater were paddling furiously beneath the water while were calm on topthis quarter is a reflection of us staying focused on the strategy and where we need to be and being able to announce things when we are able to and not beforehand so its important we understand the importance of timing with regard to that and again our objective is to achieve our goals as soon as possible but in a realistic timeframeat the same time besides that timing being important its also important that we continue to maximize value for the shareholders during this entire transformation process so were focused on all of that combined again from the operations of the business to the transformation of the businessthank you all for your support and your interest in forest city and we will talk to you in the near futureoperator thank you for your participation in todays conference this concludes the
