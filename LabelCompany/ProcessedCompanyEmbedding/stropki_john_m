economic climate success stories in the business world range from creative geniuses thinking up that perfect invention to investors funding that risky venture john stropki’s story is more traditional than that stropki began work at lincoln electric holdings inc  years ago over the decades he’s climbed the ranks literally from bottom to top today he’s president ceo and chairman of the company — and he has been since  as the fourth speaker for week seven a week titled “the us economy beyond a quick fix” stropki presented his powerpoint lecture at  am thursday in the amphitheater stropki spoke about how lincoln remains a successful corporation despite global economic turmoil on a secondary note he addressed the role china has played in keeping the business afloat — and the role it will play in recovery efforts lincoln is a clevelandbased welding company with plants in  countries around the world founded in  it retained its success using various techniques and market practices including payperproduct style of wages and disuse of layoff policies business students worldwide study lincoln in classes most notably at harvard business school one of the innovations the company has made is to submit to the green movement at least partially it’s reduced waste from  million pounds in  to  million pounds in  while recycling almost  million pounds for every  lb of steel welded at one branch the amount of water used has been reduced from one liter to almost nothing — it’s using evaporation and recycling water now “the program that we’re most proud of at least in terms of recent investments” stropki said “is that we’ve put a wind tower on our property in euclid ohio” the wind tower a  million investment produces about  percent of the facility’s electrical power it will take about  years to return on the investment but it’s “created a tremendous amount of enthusiasm” stropki said its second purpose is to show the company’s customers’ support in wind energy generation as a welding company it builds steel used in wind towers these practices have helped to keep lincoln afloat during the economic crisis stropki explained the ins and outs of the economic crisis before applying it all to the steel and welding industry then the topic switched to china china’s global domestic product is about  trillion and it’s increasing almost  percent every year — a feat stropki said would be like the us “finding the holy grail” the us has a  trillion gdp but it’s only growing at  percent each year “it doesn’t take long for one to overtake the other” he said “the predictions from the international monetary fund are that china’s total gdp will exceed the us in  that’s just around the corner” he said this shouldn’t be viewed as a negative progression china’s growth he said along with that of other countries is fueling the global economic recovery efforts however he said foreign growth only helps countries that are still participating in global trade greece’s bankruptcy and the “teetering” economies in spain portugal and italy don’t look good for global recovery he added “something that’s kind of close to home for us that i think is a great barometer to show what’s happening in the world economy is steel” stropki said “steel is a primary building component to so many things in our life — transportation appliances bridges roads there aren’t many things that don’t use steel” then to audience laughter he tagged “in fact everything should use steel from my perspective” china consumes  percent of the world’s steel while the us consumes just  percent stropki said to think about how much more use steel is getting in china because of such use of welded steel in china he said lincoln has the opportunity for market growth in   percent of lincoln’s sales went to north america while  percent in all of russia brazil india and china in   percent went to north america with  percent to russia brazil india and china he added further that sales in north america have more than doubled — meaning international sales to russia brazil india and china have jumped at least fold in  lincoln was a  billion company if things stay on track this year he said it should end up a  billion company stropki tried to explain why china is suddenly increasing in power part of it he said is the modernization people are moving from rural areas to urban areas in china which also is increasing the use of energy china and the us use about the same amount of energy but china’s energy use per person is about onefourth as great car ownership per person is significantly less as well but it is increasing stropki in the end said international trade is important to global economic health “i believe this is the biggest driver for the growth of us manufacturing right now” stropki said “it’s not the strength of the us economy — it’s the growth of the global economy” john m stropki john m stropki was named president and ceo of lincoln electric holdings inc in june  and elected
