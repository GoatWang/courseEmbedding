over to aengus kelly aengus kelly thank you brian good morning everybody and thank you for joining us for our  first quarter earnings call im happy to report another quarter of strong earnings and profitability during the first quarter we generated  of earning per share and net income of  million the strong performance of the aercap platform drove a fleet utilization rate of  for the first quarter reflecting robust demand for aircraft globally aercaps global leasing platform continues to capture the growth in demand for air travel during the first quarter we executed  transactions equal to more than one transaction every day this included  lease agreements  of which were narrowbodies and  were widebodies our average remaining lease term has now lengthened to  years a notable transaction during the quarter was the delivery of the first two a aircrafts to air caraïbes the strong demand for aircraft is also evident in the secondary market and we continue to capitalize on this through the sale of  owned aircrafts which had an average age of  years and resulted in a gain on sale of  as you are aware the sale of aircraft is a very deliberate strategy by aercap most importantly it is a critical tool in managing our portfolio and improving the overall quality of our fleet but the sales also generated excess capital that we were able to deploy by repurchasing stock at attractive levels which creates further value for our shareholders in the past  months alone we have grown book value per share by  we do recognize that the asset sales program has resulted in a reduction in assets over the past two years and has had an impact on our net interest margin however as noted it has improved our portfolio via the capital freed up from  and via the capital freed up from sales for share repurchases has resulted in significant eps and book value per share accretion we believe this is the right portfolio management strategy to follow in order to maximize shareholder value over the long term i expect our assets to begin growing again in the second half of  as our forward order books starts to deliver in earnest as you are aware we have over  billion worth of aircraft delivering in the next five years given aercaps industryleading platform we have excellent visibility over the health of all the main drivers of the industry the scale of our platform gives aercap a unique insight into enduser sentiment and demand for all aircraft types from our perspective industry fundamentals remain robust iata reported strong passenger traffic numbers for the start of  and global airline profitability remains healthy we continue to see strong demand in domestic china latin america is beginning to turn and russias recovery continues in an industry as global as ours there will always be isolated events that will generate headlines that is to be expected but through diversification and effective risk management these events should always be manageable focusing on the liability side of our business we continue to be very active in the financing markets during the first quarter alongside receiving our ig upgrade from moodys we executed  billion of financing transactions we continue to maintain  billion of available liquidity and we closed the quarter with an adjusted debt equity ratio of  to  in the current environment we believe that effectively purchasing our own fleet through share repurchases generates greater value than purchasing aircraft in the open market over the last two years we have bought back more than  million shares equivalent to more than  of the outstanding share count to this end we are announcing a new share repurchase program of  million effective through september  to close i would like to reiterate that aercap is entering the second quarter of  in a strong position we have significant earnings visibility as  of all lease rental revenue through  is now contracted this visibility along with our disciplined approach to capital allocation will continue to drive value for aercaps shareholders with that i will hand the call over to pete for a detailed review of our financial performance peter peter juhas thanks gus good morning everyone ill start on slide  of the presentation our reported net income for the first quarter was  million an increase of  over the first quarter of  the increase was driven primarily by higher gain on sale of assets and lower maintenance rates expense as well as lower losses from our aeroturbine subsidiary as we approach the final stages of our winddown of aeroturbine this is partially offset by lower income as a result of our sales of midlife and older aircraft which reduced our average lease assets by around  billion yearoveryear turning to slide  our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was  an increase of  over the first quarter of  earnings per share was impacted by the same factors driving net income as well as by the repurchase of  million shares during  and the first quarter of  you can see the impact of these share repurchases coming through and that while our net income was up  yearoveryear our eps was up  on this slide weve also provided the aftertax earnings per share impact for the same components as we did for net income on slide  our total shareholders equity as of march  was  billion and our book value per share at the end of the first quarter was  we have grown book value per share as gus mentioned by  over the past year through a combination of earnings as well as share repurchases and by  over the past two years through last friday weve repurchased around  million of shares or over  of total shares outstanding for over  billion on slide  our total revenue for the first quarter was  million the substantial amount of asset sales that weve completed over the past year reduced our average lease assets by about  billion period over period this led to lower basic lease rents which were  billion in the first quarter of  down from  billion in the prior year period our maintenance revenues for the quarter were  million a decrease from  million in  as you may recall we had a relatively high number of lease terminations and amendments in the first quarter of  and that resulted in higher maintenance revenues during that quarter our net gain on sales was  million for the first quarter compared to  million a year ago as we continue to sell midlife and older aircraft at attractive prices the sales margin was higher on the first quarter at around  which indicates a strong demand that we continue to see from investors for older used aircraft our other income was  million for the quarter the increase in other income over the prior year period was primarily driven by contractual payments resulting from lease termination turning to slide  our net interest margin was  million for the quarter compared to  million in the prior year period again the decrease was due to the reduction of our average lease assets from  billion to  billion due to asset sales our annualized net spread for the first quarter was  compared to  in the first quarter of  as we discussed last quarter the two main drivers of this are reduction in the average age of our fleets and an increase in our average cost of debt this is consistent with the guidance we gave at our investor day in november where we mentioned that our net spread for  would be lower because of these two factors our average cost of debt increased from  in the first quarter of  to  this past quarter primarily due to the issuance of new longerterm bonds that replaced shorterterm ilfc notes which had a lower interest expense due to purchase accounting the average age of our fleet decreased from  years to  years as a result of the asset sales in the delivery of new aircraft the new aircraft generally have lower yields than older aircraft on slide  for the quarter we had a net gain on sale of  million up from  million in the prior year we continue to actively sell older aircraft to improve the quality of our fleet during the first quarter we sold  aircraft there were yearsold on average we also placed three ngs on longterm leases which led us to reclassify these aircraft from operating to finance leases on the purchase side we took delivery of  new aircraft during the first quarter including seven aneos two as and two boeing s as gus mentioned our capex for the year is backend loaded with about twothirds of our deliveries coming in q and q turning to slide  our leasing expenses were  million for the first quarter down from  million in  the decrease was primarily due to lower maintenance rates expense as a result of fewer maintenance events during the quarter our sga expenses were  million down from  million in the first quarter of  a decrease in sga expenses was primarily due to the downsizing of aeroturbine we had no aircraft asset impairments in the first quarter as you may recall the asset impairments of  million in the first quarter of  were more than offset by the release of over  million of maintenance reserves and finally we had transaction restructuring expenses of  million during the quarter these are all related to the aeroturbine downsizing during the first quarter we amended the lease of aeroturbines facility in miami and we had some lease termination fees associated with that amendment we also repaid aeroturbines revolving credit facility during the first quarter and we have now consigned all of the aeroturbines remaining parts inventory to a thirdparty to be sold down over time slide  we continue to maintain a very strong liquidity position as of march  we had available liquidity of  billion together with our estimated operating cash flows that gives us  times coverage of our next  months cash needs or excess cash coverage of  billion in the first quarter we completed  billion worth of financing transactions these included the amendment extension and upsizing of our revolving credit facility from  billion to  billion the amendment and extension of around  billion of term loan facilities the  million public bond offering we did in the first quarter and around  million of other unsecured deals as you can see from this activity financing market for aircraft remains very strong and we appreciate all the support we continue to have from our banks and our debt investors so to wrap up for aercap this is another quarter of strong operating and financial performance for our business we continue to execute on our placements of aircraft we completed  aircraft transactions more than one a day we continue to sell older aircraft to improve our portfolio and bid for those assets remains strong as you can see from the health margin at which we sold them and we use the excess capital we generated to buy back  million shares so far this year for a total of  million at the same time we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position with a strong access to funding as we approach a period of higher deliveries in the latter half of this year and of course with the moodys upgrade during the first quarter we are now the only independent aircraft leasing company to be rated investment grade by all three major rating agencies with that we will turn it over for qa questionandanswer session operator okay thank you operator instructions we will pause now for just a moment to assemble the queue we will take our first question today from jason arnold from rbc capital markets please go ahead jason arnold hi guys good morning i guess just two quick questions one was on the robust gain on sale margin here this quarter i was just wondering if you could talk a bit more on detail on that maybe specifically any types in particular that youre seeing higher demand on peter juhas it was really across the board jason i mean if you look at  we try to lay out there on the slides but if you look at the average age of the aircraft that we sold it was  years in this quarter going back to the first quarter of  it was  years so its really very similar we are just seeing a lot of demand for these used aircraft jason arnold okay great thanks and then the other question i had was maybe you just update us on your view on the widebody market weve heard recently some stories from i believe its malaysia and then a few other airlines using or at least contemplating use of widebodies on high traffic routes that are typically maybe more narrowbody on focus so maybe just some thoughts on that avenue there as well aengus kelly sure we are seeing an upgauging of aircraft and its a theme that has been going through the industry for quite a few years now there are a number of routes particularly in slot constrained airports like jakarta where there is and i should say kuala lumpur as well where there is definitely traffic being spilled that can be picked up if there are bigger aircraft on the route now of course the risk of putting a bigger aircraft on the route is are you sure the traffic will be there for long enough to justify it and it seems based on what weve observed as we work with airlines that there are a number of hubs in the world that are significantly congested on both sides that justify moving from in malaysians case  to a larger gauge airplane that is something we are observing i mean that the widebody market overall a good widebody will move its worth nothing that this  we moved  boats already ph  widebodies in the last  years and indeed we have leased  as and s as well jason arnold excellent thanks very much for the color guys operator thank you we will now take our next question from jamie baker from jpmorgan nish mani hey good morning guys this is actually nish mani on for jamie can you guys remind us of your exposure to alitalia and how you guys think about managing counterpartyrisk kind of more broadly speaking aengus kelly sure we have less than  of lease revenue coming from alitalia we manage counterparty risk very carefully as i mentioned in my prepared comments there are always events that occur last year it was focused more in turkey and then before that in russia and brazil so this is nothing unusual and if you look at our credit costs over the last  years you can see that where they have averaged less than  of lease revenue per annum so we are working with alitalia now and we will see how that evolves over the coming weeks and months nish mani okay great and then just switching gears for one second taking a step back and looking at your overall fleet strategy i mean you guys sold pretty healthy amount of aircraft in the first quarter and it sound like its a portfolio optimization exercise if you take advantage of the market and demand for these midlife assets but as your order books for new deliveries accelerate in  and  can you help us think about how you want to manage the border portfolio are you solving for an average age for example and taking advantage of this period or are you kind of content with being in that kind of sevenyear bracket so to speak thank you so much aengus kelly were quite content where the average age is we generally feel that at the higher end of the range you dont want to be much more than eight years of age on average and at the lower end you dont want to be too much less than low fives i think in that area you provide the right risk and reward return for our shareholders so thats where we target and thats where we are at the moment as the new fleet deliveries on the order book just by virtue of the value of the new aircraft delivering you will continue to see a decline in the average life of the fleet and in terms of asset sales there are certain assets of course that we do want to dispose of and if we feel that we received the right bid and well continue to sell those assets but its a combination of looking at the returns from holding the asset versus are we getting the right price to sell it nish mani okay that makes sense i really appreciate the color thank you so much aengus kelly youre welcome operator thank you our next question comes from moshe orenbuch from credit suisse please go ahead james ulan good morning this is actually james ulan on for moshe thanks for taking my question we see that your coverage ratio is going up i guess from kind of  to  to  and i was wondering if you guys can expand on your philosophy on how to prepare the company for a downturn especially on the liability side to protect against risk and how to potentially prepare the company to go on the office in a downturn scenario peter juhas sure thanks james so the most important thing obviously we want to maintain a high level of financial flexibility and thats why we carry the liquidity balances that we have today so when we look at it we say its got  billion of liquidity if you look at that plus the operating cash flow that we expect and how does that compare to our needs over that period we also  but its also equally important to make sure that the facilities that we have have the right  or structured appropriately so they dont have any max or anything like that that in them that would not be of use when  if a downturn comes so were very cognizant of that youre right that were carrying higher levels of liquidity recently thats really just a function id say some of it is timing function so it will move around we still target  times id say we tend  as youve seen we tend to be somewhat above that but longer term i expect that that ratio will come down really because the level of capex that we have ramps up in the second half of this year and so that ratio itself will come down but in terms of an absolute amount of liquidity that were holding that will still remain high james ulan okay thats helpful and can you kind of talk about the competitive environment for executing more larger sale leaseback transactions some of your competitors on their recent conference calls announced bigger transactions and we were just wondering kind of how todays environment compares to the past and whether we might see something incremental in addition to your order book aengus kelly look as we said before our objective is to spend our shareholders money to achieve the maximum return for an appropriate level of risk over the course of the last several years the growth of the company has been fueled by ma and from that ma an attractive order book that came with it we then used a lot of our surplus capital to delever the business over the course of the last  months weve been in the position to allocate capital as we see fit be it for oem orders be it for sale leasebacks share buybacks or ma activity as we evaluate sale leasebacks every week we bid on sale leasebacks every single week we evaluate that versus the attractiveness of buying our own aircraft by the share buybacks and at the moment we are yet to seeing a transaction that is superior in a risk and reward balance than buying our own aircraft so long as that remains the case well continue likely to buy our own stock however that can change very quickly too and when it does change we will be there and we will do it in large size as we have in the past james ulan great thank you operator our next question comes from michael linenberg from deutsche bank please go ahead unidentified analyst hi this is actually matt on for mike so american has recently deferred as and it has been reported in the press that delta would like to defer up to  as and united has indicated that the a may not be right for its fleet is it response so the big three have any impact on the as desirability and residual values aengus kelly dont think so i cant say as to exactly why theyre deferring the aircraft i understand from some of the comments they may be to do to the alleviation of working capital what you did see with the a was the largest airline in asia just order  of them last week and there is another few unidentified orders that were announced also the a and boeing  are the widebody airplanes of the future and they are both we believe excellent airplanes and theyll form the backbone likely of our widebody fleet as we go forward unidentified analyst thank you and can you just discuss any potential delivery delays due to aircraft manufacturer or supplier bottlenecks thank you aengus kelly sure i mean we had addressed this at our investor day in november of last year when we had given some guidance on what we thought would occur with delays as we are working continuously with all the manufactures the biggest owner of commercial airplanes in the world and the information we gave at that point in time is still accurate and they are the delays that weve observed and if that changes well make you aware if theres any material change to those delays but what we envisaged last year is so far i stress that so far that what has occurred unidentified analyst thanks for taking my question guys aengus kelly youre welcome operator thank you our next question comes from helane becker from cowen and company please go ahead unidentified analyst hey guys its actually steve on for helane just going off of that it looks like you guys pulled forward some orders into  and i believe also in as a couple of your customers have  actually had to put those aircrafts on the sideline are you guys getting penalized for those aircrafts thanks peter juhas sure let me answer the first part of your question so on the aneos youre right move eight in our schedule on page  we moved eight of those that we had originally expected to be delivered in  back to  and basically thats because of the discussion that weve had with airbus and those in general weve assumed about three to four month average delay on the platinum ph in the aneos and about one month delay or so on the cfm aneos aengus kelly we should note of course those eight planes are just pulled forward primarily from the q into q so wont have any big impact on the guidance that we have given to you in any event and then on your question about airplanes that are out of service at the moment there are ongoing discussions that we are having with the airlines and the oems and cant comment on those unidentified analyst okay and then one of your other customers actually  sorry one of your other competitors started to use their management capabilities to manage aircraft that typically dont  wouldnt fit into their fleet have you guys thought of using your management capabilities a little more fully maybe managing some younger aircraft maybe below that five years you were talking about managing some older aircrafts  years or older that wouldnt typically fit into the aircraft fleet but you can maybe monetize the aircraft cycle a little more aengus kelly sure i mean obviously weve managed hundreds of airplanes over the years and if you look at the abs market as an instrument thats often used for that reason and we invented the abs market  years ago and did the largest transaction ever done and its still since and have issued more abs deals than anyone in the world for all different reasons and variations the reasons for abs are excellent they can generate significant amount of leverage at a competitive price if you dont have access to competitively price on secured aircraft they can very importantly alleviate balance sheet pressures that was something why we have primarily done it in the past and the other big user of abs is being gecas theyve primarily used it for gain on sale to be fair you would never really use it for management fair revenue streams because over time its a big commitment over a longterm period the cost associated with adequately servicing those vehicles and while those fees are attractive at the front end what actually happens over time is you have to produce an excellent standard of reporting and service to those vehicles and rightly so and that doesnt come cost free unidentified analyst okay thanks guys operator thank you our next question comes from christopher nolan from fbr christopher nolan hey pete can you give us an update on your  capex estimate peter juhas sure so chris id say for the fullyear  its about  billion christopher nolan great and then… peter juhas so we did about  million in the first quarter so thats  billion remaining roughly christopher nolan great and then just sort of a housekeeping question whats the book value of the aircraft sold in the first quarter peter juhas i dont think weve disclosed the actual book value of the aircraft sold it was roughly  if you look at the cash flow statement you will see it was around  million thats on the cash flow statement there is another  million or so of maintenance related to that so altogether id say the cost of goods sold will be around  million altogether christopher nolan great thanks for taking my questions operator thank you operator instructions we will take our next question from arren cyganovich from da davidson please go ahead arren cyganovich hi can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment now we have another fairly large player with avolon acquiring a lot of assets what are you seeing from competition is it relatively rational and has it impacted much in terms of your placements of fleet aengus kelly i think it is  consolidation is a relatively positive thing for the industry we believe and i think it was good that an experienced player acquired a large leasing company such as cit and in capable hands we have seen no evidence of any irrational activity and we think the consolidation is a positive and we will just have to see if there is further consolidation at the lower levels of the business as well arren cyganovich great thanks and in terms of the capex numbers peter that you just laid out the  billion whats the cadence of those deliveries throughout the next three quarters peter juhas its backend loaded so about twothirds of it is in the third and fourth quarter of the year it keeps ramping up each quarter basically arren cyganovich and those delays for the neos is that included in that and those assumptions are  is there a risk that some of that would be pushed over to  peter juhas well thats included in those numbers and this is based on our latest discussions with airbus so obviously there is always a risk that some of them wont deliver on time but this is our best estimate right now i mean just to be clear if you look at what we said in investor day we were assuming further delays then and were now are assuming a little bit less than that so it does factor in to our forecast arren cyganovich okay and in terms of the  placements through to  is that only on an new order deliveries or is that also releasing stuff thats coming after books aengus kelly and thats all revenue from new aircraft and from the rollover of the existing fleet arren cyganovich okay and just lastly the other income line was somewhat elevated this quarter was there anything that in particular that was nonrecurring or onetime revenue there peter juhas it was really due to  primarily due to a termination payment that we received related to a termination last year arren cyganovich okay all right thank you operator thank you operator instructions we will now take our next question from scott valentin from compass point scott valentin good morning thanks for taking my question just quickly on the net spread its running i think it was  for the quarter and i think the guidance for the year from the investor day was  just wondering if you expect kind of  if its going to trend down over the course of the year or do you think with the changes in rate may be worse we were back in november the forward curve you think the margin can remain higher than initial guidance peter juhas yes thanks scott i would stick with the guidance that we got right now i think  is probably a good number and one thing you have to keep in mind is that were leasing these aircraft well in advance and so its hard for any movement to have an impact really on the  numbers it has to  it would impact  rise in rates could impact further out but it will be hard to see much of an impact i would say on  it could be   to  but somewhere in that ballpark scott valentin okay thanks and then just in terms of kind of the  yes the relationship between the fleet size and sales and buyback to the extent that you guys sell more aircrafts over the  roughly  billion i think was the guidance at the investor day if you go above that would we expect you that more in the buyback i think you guys had guided to about  million or roughly  billion on return of capital as gain on sales higher do you expect to kind of reinvest that into repurchasing shares peter juhas yes so at investor day i have said  million roughly of excess capital for the year which as youve seen weve been using that excess capital to buy back stock but we always have valued at that time id say that was based on a  billion of sales for the year as gus mentioned were likely to see more than  billion for the year at this point so i think if conditions were to continue the way they are now we would likely use that to buy back stock so yes both the larger size of buybacks as well as gains on sale contributes to excess capital that we can deploy scott valentin great and just one final question i think gus you said  number includes all releasing and new deliveries how much is left to release in  and  in terms of  i dont know if its percentage of the fleet i dont know you want to scrap it but just the idea of how much is left in  and  to release aengus kelly if theres anything  there is not a huge amount left in terms of the percentage of the aircraft theres virtually nothing left in  there is left in a handful of new aircrafts and then a number of lower value narrowbodies as well and one or two widebodies in  but as a percentage of the overall revenue base of the business there not a huge number scott valentin thanks very much operator thank you our next question comes from jason arnold from rbc capital markets jason arnold hey guys one other quick followup for gus just curious if you could comment on the max  and your thoughts around that particular potential product aengus kelly i mean we will  we continue to look at the aircraft and we think its certainly an improvement on the max  but we will just continue to evaluate it jason arnold okay thanks operator thank you that will conclude todays questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr canniffe for any additional or closing remarks brian canniffe thank you operator thank you

and will be archived for replay i’ll now turn the call over to aengus kelly aengus kelly thank you brian good morning everybody and thank you for joining us for our  fourth quarter and fullyear earnings call i’m delighted to report another quarter of strong earnings and profitability we had a record fourth quarter with net aftertax income of  million and  billion for the full year net aftertax income this equates to reported earnings per share of  for the quarter and  for the full year you will have noticed that we are no longer reporting adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share numbers keith and pete will provide more information on this the strong performance of the aercap platform which drove a fleet utilization rate of  for the full year reflects the continuing resilience of air travel and its ability to withstand the numerous challenges faced by the industry in recent years in  the breadth and depth of our platform enabled us to capture increasing demand for aircraft by executing a record  transactions which includes the signing of  lease agreements this is almost two aircraft transactions every working day during the fourth quarter alone we completed  aircraft transactions including  new lease agreements  new aircraft purchases and  aircraft sales notable deliveries included the first airbus aneo to spirit airlines making the airline the first in the united states to receive this aircraft type we also delivered the first boeing  dreamliner to air france we now have  of new aircraft deliveries to  leased this level of activity provides the business with a high level of visibility into future earnings we continue to actively manage our portfolio during the fourth quarter resulting in over  billion of sales for the full year  of which were widebodies based on ascend market data we estimate this accounts for approximately  of all used aircraft traded globally in  this volume of activity demonstrates not only the unequaled reach and scale of the aercap platform but also the continued demand for aircraft in the secondary market there has been discussion in the media regarding recent deferral activity by several airlines and what if any impact this has unless or is like aercap as i have said before deferrals are nothing new and they are to be expected the reason is that the oems know several things firstly they know air traffic will grow and every  years it will approximately double secondly they know they have a noninvestment grade customer base in the airline and three they know they have a huge fixed cost phase in cash the only way to hedge these risks and meet future demand is to over commit an order that is why we see that orders are extremely cyclical and always have been but deliveries are very stable and have been also deliveries closely track the growth in air travel it is to be expected that from time to time certain regions or carriers become oversupplied and require deferrals clearly from our transaction activity however in  there continues to be solid demand for aircraft on a global basis and we dont see that changing like the oem but unlike the airline aercap is able to sell its product wherever in the world there is demand we are not constrained by geography so looking ahead to  we expect to see stable levels of growth in the market and this will be supported by the th year in a row of aggregate airline profitability our airline client also remain well supported by favorable financing environment with the debt and capital markets looking to participate in the need to finance growth in the sector as far as aircraft own financing activities are concerned we signed financing transactions for  billion during the fourth quarter and we maintain over  billion of available liquidity our debt to equity ratio remains at  to  you will also have seen last week our upgrade to investment grade by moodys we are now the only independent lessor in the world that is investment grade rated by all the three rating agencies we view this as a further endorsement of the way we are managing the business during  we continued to demonstrate discipline when deploying shareholder capital your money in the fourth quarter we repurchased  million shares for  million this brings the fullyear total of share repurchases to  million shares for  million equating to  of the outstanding share count the level of visibility we have into future earnings and the substantial excess capital we were able to generate provides us with the confidence to increase our share buyback program by  million through june  as you’ve heard me say before we remain true to our mantra we do not grow for growth sake and we adopt a flexible and nimble approach to generating the greatest longterm value for our shareholders with that i will hand the call over to keith and pete for a detailed review of our financial performance keith helming thank guys good morning i’ll on slide  of the presentation our reported net income for the fourth quarter was  million and was  billion for fullyear  our return on equity for the full year was approximately  on a reported basis fourth quarter  reported net income was up  over the fourth quarter of  driven in part by higher gains on sales and other nonrecurring items as well as lower aeroturbine losses the decrease in yearoveryear net income was due to a few items including sales of older aircraft during  and ’ which reduced average lease assets by approximately  billion the proceeds from these sales were used to repurchase shares as you can see we have just provided reported net income on this slide going forward we have decided to eliminate adjusted net income and earnings per share and focus on our gaap results only instead we will provide the required information in order to understand our results by showing the key components of net income as we have done on this slide we believe this will help simplify our financial disclosures and make it easier to understand our financial results with this transitional period we have provided the same reconciliation from reported net income and earnings per share the adjusted numbers on slides  and  of this presentation the components of net income that we have provided include those that have the most significant impact to the result gains on the sale of aircraft and other nonrecurring items provided  million of net income in the fourth quarter of  the nonrecurring items in fourth quarter included income from lease terminations and a gain related to the repayment of a note receivable earlier than expected we incurred a loss of  million in our aeroturbine business during fourth quarter which consisted primarily of operating expenses and further severance related costs the downsizing of aeroturbine remains on track with a schedule we discussed previously the maintenance rights amortization impacted fourth quarter was a reduction to net income of  million and all other earnings in fourth quarter was  million turning to slide  our earnings per share for the fourth quarter on a reported basis were  and for the fullyear  earnings per share were  fourth quarter  earnings per share were up  over the fourth quarter of  driven by the same factors as those impacting net income and were also favorably impacted by our share repurchase fullyear  earnings per share were down slightly versus the fullyear of  and were also impacted by the same factors as those driving net income although full year  earnings per share were favorably impacted by our share repurchases it does not yet reflect the fullyear benefits we will receive going forward from this year as we repurchased during  on this slide we have also provided the earnings per share impact to the same component as we did for net income slide  our book value per share at the end of fourth quarter was  over the past year we have grown book value per share by  and since the end of  book value per share has grown by  this has been accomplished through a combination of earnings as well as share repurchases since the beginning of  and through  we have reduced our share count by  million shares or approximately  of our total shares outstanding including the shares purchased todate in  we have repurchased  of total shares outstanding in doing so we have returned over  billion to shareholders during this time period with that let me pass it over to pete who will take through the rest of financial results pete juhas thanks keith good morning everyone starting on slide  our total revenue for the fourth quarter was  billion an increase of  million from the fourth quarter of  as keith mentioned our aircraft sales during  and  reduced our average lease assets by about  billion this led to a reduction in basic lease rents from  billion in the fourth quarter of  to  billion in  our maintenance revenues for the fourth quarter were  million an increase of  million from the prioryear period primarily due to lease terminations and amendments along with a higher amount of end of lease payments during the fourth quarter of  our net gain on sales was  million for the quarter compared to  million a year ago the increase was primarily due to the higher volume of sales that closed in the fourth quarter of  as we completed the sales of a number of larger portfolios that were signed earlier in the year our other income was  million for the quarter which included  million of nonrecurring income from a combination of lease terminations and a gain related to the repayment of our note receivable earlier than we had expected turning to slide  the reduction on average lease assets due to asset sales resulted in lower basic lease rents and a net interest margin of  million in the fourth quarter compared to  million in the prioryear period our annualized net spread for the fourth quarter was  compared to  in the fourth quarter of  the two main drivers of this were an increase in our average cost of debt and a reduction in the average age of our fleet our average cost of debt increased from  in the fourth quarter of  to  this past quarter primarily due to the issuance of new longer term bonds that replaced shorter term ilfc notes that had a lower interest expense as a result of purchase accounting the average age of our fleet improved from  years to  years as a result of asset sales and the delivery of new aircraft which typically have lower yields in older aircraft on slide  in the fourth quarter we sold  aircraft with an average age of  years we also placed three ngs on longterm leases which lead us to reclassify them from operating to finance leases for the full year we had a net gain of  million resulting in a sales margin of approximately  for the full year on the purchase side we took delivery of  new aircraft during the fourth quarter including  aneos three as and two boeing s turning to slide  our leasing expenses were  million for the froth quarter versus  million in  the increase was primarily due to costs associated with the lease terminations during the fourth quarter of  our sga expenses were  million down from  million in the fourth quarter of  the decrease in expenses was primarily due to the downsizing of aeroturbine we reported asset impairments of  million in the fourth quarter which related to the lease terminations of two aircraft this was more than offset by the release of  million of maintenance reserves related to these aircraft and finally we had transaction restructuring expenses of  million during the quarter which were primarily severance costs related the aeroturbine downsizing slide  we continued to maintain a very strong liquidity position ending the year with available liquidity of  billion together with our estimated operating cash flows that gives us  times coverage of our next  months cash needs or excess cash coverage of  billion so far this year weve already completed a number of significant financing transactions these include the amendment extension and upsizing of our revolving credit facility from  billion to  billion the amendment and extension of over  billion of term loan facilities and the  million bond offering we did in january that was heavily oversubscribed so overall for aercap this was another quarter of strong operating and financial performance for our business to finish a very strong  we leased  aircraft during the year an average of more than one every business day we sold over  billion worth of assets significantly improving the quality of our portfolio and we use the excess capital we generated to buy back  million shares or  million worth of stock at the same time we continued to delever and improve our balance sheet during the course of the year and with the moodys upgrade announced last week were now the only independent aircraft leasing company to be rated investment grade by all three major rating agencies with that now i will turn it over for qa questionandanswer session operator operator instructions we will take our first question from helane becker of cowen and company please go ahead your line is open conor cunningham hey guys its actually conor cunningham in for helane so it seems like aercap has been very active with the aircraft sales over the last seven years can you talk about like the expected trends in   so would you expect the sales to slow as we get a new uptick  as you have an uptick in new technology entering the fleet thanks aengus kelly conor as you know we expect to sell at least  billion of assets each year in the last two years we have significantly exceeded that now the key to selling assets is to sell assets that you want to sell and we tend to target the midlife assets of  to  years of age average age is around  years as we want to try and drive the average age of the portfolio down a bit and focus the portfolio more on the newer technology assets if we still observe a strong bid in the market i think well continue to sell the levels in excess of the billion dollars and for the assets we want to sell so far the market this year seems to be reasonably strong and that could change of course but at the moment i would say its likely that we will probably exceed the billion dollars by how much though is uncertain conor cunningham great and just a follow up theres been some airlines that talked about delays of the aneo  have you incorporated that into your outlook or do you expect them to be a major change to any of your delivery schedules in the near term aengus kelly it may lead to a slide of several months for sure on the pratt  whitney powered aneo i think its likely that we will see three months but that has been incorporated into the guidance weve given if there are any further delays well update on the next call conor cunningham and then i just have one maintenance question in terms of how you guys calculate your utilization rate do you include assets held for sale i assume you do if theres a lease attached to it in the near term keith helming yeah we do include those in it operator we will take our next question from gary liebowitz of wells fargo securities please go ahead your line is open gary liebowitz guys back in november you talked about the sort of medium term sale leaseback addressable market opportunity are you seeing prices in that market get anywhere close to attractive or share buybacks still far more additive aengus kelly todate share buybacks have been more attractive we bid every week in fact we put out three bids yesterday but thats nothing unusual gary we will put out several bids every week we want to make sure you know where the market is in november we did say that we expected the addressable market to increase in size as more of the new technology begins to deliver now that is definitely happening that there is more activity pricing though i think still remains tilted in a wrong direction for us we dont feel theres a fair reward for the risk but we continue to bid at levels that we think do make sense but as we sit here today the share buyback is a more attractive alternative that may well change though during the year as the addressable market gets bigger gary liebowitz and for keith or peter it looks you’ve accelerated some  deliveries into ’ at least relative to where we were back on september  what is the right capex number to be using for this year keith helming so gary thats correct we’ve moved some forward actually from  based on notifications that weve gotten from airbus so just to recall we had assumed basically a sixmonth delay in terms of  approximately aneos and were still assuming that but when we’ve gotten a notification from airbus weve moved those up to whatever the notification date was in terms of capex contracted capex for  will be about just over  billion gary liebowitz just one last one since youre moving to gaap instead of adjusted eps what should we be assuming for  the mra adjustment is it about flat like you thought it might be going or how much should we be adjusting for that keith helming the maintenance rights adjustment for  should be around what we talked about  million thats what weve given out in the first quarter of last year and thats still probably the best estimate gary liebowitz and then going down in  pete juhas in  i think  million number that we gave is still about right operator we will take our take question from moshe orenbuch of credit suisse please go ahead your line is open moshe orenbuch i mean most of my questions actually have been asked and answered already but could you maybe just talk a little bit about the decision to go to eliminate the other forms of reporting and go just to gaap aengus kelly so as pete just pointed out  should actually really be the last year where the maintenance rights impact is significant and the other items including aeroturbine in  is not expected to be significant so we think that going forward providing just one net income number the gaap number and providing this component analysis would be a better way to kind of explain whats going on with the business result that way we dont have to sit here and always debate as to what goes into or is excluded from adjusted net income or a nongaap measure so were going to focus on gaap results and well provide whatever analytical information we need to explain the results moshe orenbuch and i guess you know given that youve got the expectation of  billion of capex and then the  million of the buyback over the first half how does that do you think will that impact the debt to equity ratio i mean youre kind of a few ticks below your target how would that likely evolve over that period pete juhas so right now were at  to  thats where we ended the year well continue to stay within the  to  to  range during the course of the year and well always want to maintain within that level so i think you should just expect us to be well within that range for the year operator we will take our met question from rajeev lalwani of morgan stanley please go ahead your line is open rajeev lalwani can you walk us through the implications of rising interest rates to borrowing costs and then also how you think thats going to impact yields as we look forward and then a follow up aengus kelly the first thing is that we run a hedged book so we are not exposed to rising rates on the book of business thats written and the vast  and any least thats placed on forward order has an automatic adjustment for any increase in interest rates now as we go forward rises in rates have historically being accompanied by rises in lease rates on the used aircraft theres generally a lag period it could be six months give or take but it only applies to those aircraft that are repricing at that point in time as rates are rising and having said that also a rising rate environment generally correlate to a better global growth environment and what weve always observed in the past the rising rate environment generally leads to asset insulation so as long as you’re hedged right and you’re operating in a decent global economy rising rates should not be a threat to the business and as i said this company does run a hedged book pete anything you would add pete juhas no i think that’s it rajeev lalwani what about the debt side as far as borrowing costs aengus kelly my point is that if  so obviously if swap rate  the yield curve goes up by  points across the curve and your underlying cost of funding has risen by  basis points the lease rate should move with that and certainly our new aircraft they move immediately day by day on the new aircraft with the movement in the swap rates rajeev lalwani i got your point now another question you previously talked about asset values being marked below market it is hard to spend on your books can you talk about how that takes into account just sga and lease expense levels and just thoughts going forward as far as overall sga levels and what we should be modeling aengus kelly so on the sga front i would expect quarterly average should be around  million a quarter thats probably the best run rate to be using for that after the first half of  we dont expect to have really any indiscernible aeroturbine so that would be really just core leasing business rajeev lalwani when you talk about your asset values does not take into account sga levels or is that just a separate line item aengus kelly no it does not  no it does not take into consideration sga it’s just looking at the aircraft value itself all components of the aircraft value operator we will take our next question from jamie baker of jp morgan please go ahead your line is open nish mani hey good afternoon guys this is actually nish mani on for jamie baker i want to ask you a quick question about how you guys are thinking about potential tax reform in the united states and how that would impact us airline decisions to lease versus own i mean obviously there are other economic and private considerations there but have you started to engage your us customers on this topic aengus kelly so nish at this point it’s a little early to predict how us tax reform will play out from our standpoint were obviously not a us company and we have very few assets in the us so there would be very little direct impact we think in terms of the impact on our customers and on the oems its very preliminary at this stage and its hard to predict how any of the provisions including the border adjustment mechanism could actually  whether it will actually happen and if so how exactly would that play out obviously were monitoring developments in this area but i think its a little early to tell at this point nish mani yeah okay thats helpful and a quick question on  pricing just want to see if you guys could provide any color on  pricing specifically by model today relative to maybe a year ago or so and see if any of the market has changed at all aengus kelly well we have moved i mean in total between what weve taken and what weve bought on sale leaseback and still on order we had over  s we were over  of the market we’ve sold some of those assets the  we think is a tremendous airplane we see good demand for that we have only three units left out of our entire position and theyre coming in ish and we can put them away if we want to i think youll see that the  has been fairly durable over the last year we havent seen any material move one way or the other in the last  months in the lease rates obviously interest rates impacted as interest rates fell significantly last year the absolute rate went down with that but overall its still a very good airplane and its the heart of the family we dont have any s and on the  a few years ago we converted all of our open positions into  so i think that gives you a good indication of where we think the heart of the market is and where theres a fair risk and reward for the owners operator we will take our next question from jason arnold of rbc capital markets please go ahead your line is open jason arnold please go ahead your line is open brian canniffe operator we’ll take the next question operator we will take our next question from justine fischerof goldman sachs please go ahead your line is open justine fischer good morning okay the first question i have is just on the message for financing your capex this year and on the balance sheet i know that you guys have the secured debt to unsecured debt ratio of   right now and you guys have said that you want to maintain it around that level in order to maintain access to various parts of capital but with an investment grade rating i would think that that access should remain more open overtime to various positive capital even if you didnt use one of them for a couple of years lets say if the unsecured market was very good and also it probably creates more consistent access to the unsecured market so does the rating change now that indiscernible all three agencies change the way youre viewing your secured to unsecured debt ratio keith helming justine thanks for the question no it doesnt really change it in our minds i mean as you said we want to make sure that we maintain access to all types of funding so we cap our secured debt to total assets ratio at  we’re just below that at this point and that will move around right it will move around somewhat below that  from time to time but we think that being at that level gives us we have good access to the unsecured markets as weve seen right we have good access to the secured markets as well were bringing in new lenders and we think that thats an appropriate place to be justine fischer okay yeah so the  was the percent of your total debt outstanding so your target is  debt to assets i was talking about a different number and then the other question is just on the widebody deferrals for gus i know that there are definitely deferrals all the time and we saw that with some latin american airlines the lessor has played a huge role in helping to figure out some of the delivery problems there despite the difficulties in demand that we saw but i think that whats concerning investors is that with gulf carriers now they represent a huge percentage of the widebody backlog and i think in peoples recent memories we can think of a region that represents such a huge percent of the backlog that is going to see deferrals so can you tell us your view on how to lay investor concerns given the size of the gulf carriers in the order book aengus kelly justine i would say that we have certainly seen a region having a much bigger share of the backlog having gone through significant stress for a long period of time which would be the north american market as you know most north american airlines have filed multiple times with massive backlogs and massive amounts of airplanes in the system far greater than what’s in the gulf i would go back to what i have said in my prepared comments the oems know that there will be growth in air travel the oems know theyve a noninvestment grade customer base and theyve a massive fixed cost base they have to cover in that regard i think the oems knew when they were taking those orders from several airlines with the same business model that it was likely not all of those aircraft would be delivered in a timeframe order but they didnt know which one would make it or which one will take more of them in the nearer term so they needed to take them from all of them it’s similar to what happened in india where they overcommitted to everyone and kingfisher was the one that everyone thought would make it at the start but didnt so its just  its nothing really new in the scheme of things and i think we will see the middle eastern carriers have revolutionized air travel theyve been tremendous for the consumer absolutely tremendous you can now fly for less in absolute dollar amounts almost anywhere in the world than you could do  years ago thats inflation  and thats without adjusting for inflation so these carriers have been a massive boon for the consumers and i do think that as we go forward theyll work their way through their issues but this is nothing that we havent seen before and the oems are not going to put the national carriers of these countries into bankruptcy that will not happen they will work with them they will defer what needs to be done as always for any airline in the world it is an expensive discussion to go indiscernible and thats how the oems make a lot of money justine is by deferrals they know the day the airlines signs the order there is a high likelihood that theyll have to come back and look for help and when they do that the price goes up significantly and so its part of the oem business model and their profit margin to expect deferrals operator we will take our next question from michael linenberg of deutsche bank please go ahead your line is open michael linenberg yeah hey good morning good afternoon everybody peter i think you had mentioned the sales margin was about  for the full year on the assets sold what was it for the fourth quarter did you say that pete juhas i didnt say that it was actually higher for the fourth quarter it was around  for the fourth quarter and thats really  that moves around  it moves around depending on what happens to close during that quarter as i mentioned before we had a number of big portfolios that comprised a big percentage of the sales during last year and so some of those closed in the second quarter some in the third some in the fourth and so i think its probably best to look at the full year margin i think thats more reflective of what we would expect going forward as well michael linenberg okay great thats helpful and then just my second question keith you had presented this focusing on this gaap number and i get that although there is that element of nonrecurring and that is something that is notoriously difficult to forecast im not sure in subsequent quarters are you going to put out a like an k in advance about what those potential nonrecurring numbers are so that we have a forecast that can sync up with what you’re thinking about on a gaap basis and then just a follow on what was that nonrecurring in that  million just so i have the right numbers here what was the nonrecurring number in the fourth quarter if you could provide that thank you keith helming yeah well the gain on sale you can see that in the slide it was about  of that total number the nonrecurring items would fall into the other income category and it consisted of primarily lease terminations so effectively payments we received as a result of lease terminations as well as effectively income on notes receivable that was paid off early so these are two as we referred to nonrecurring items and we dont expect to see those significantly in future periods now in terms of going forward i mean whenever we have this thing we will break out those items and make sure that people understand whats in the numbers whats recurring what isn’t recurring and to the extent obviously that we know in advance what the numbers will be in the forecast we would provide that as well so even though were going to a different way of reporting here the information we will be as transparent with it as we always have been operator we will take our next question from andrew light of citi please go ahead your line is open andrew light yeah hi there got a question on european airlines youve got fairly significant exposure to the three airlines in europe i mean somewhat distressed situation do you expect in general in europe to see more defaults andor restructured initiatives to there aengus kelly andrew europe is doing fine for us and has done so for the last couple of years actually weve moved a lot of aircraft in europe theres always europe is a highly fragmented market and so that leads itself naturally to some weaker players but will we have some restructuring defaults possibly but i dont see anything out of the ordinary i think the area where there is obviously concern at the moment is more around turkey than anywhere else given the events there during last summer and the decline in traffic in turkey due to the tragic events recently but having said that then we have seen a turn in russia two years ago russia was in a really tough spot and we were taking lots of airplanes out of russia far greater than anything thats going on in europe at the moment and those did not have a material impact on the result of this company during that period of time and now with the stronger ruble and people just have  once people travel they want to travel again thats why its so resilient and people have adjusted their budgets and we still  we see tremendous demand from the russian traveler again to go abroad they experienced it for the first time over the last decade and people adjust their budgets so that this is one of the last things that gets caught in a household and were stressing the resilience of that in the russian market but i would say at the moment on a global basis turkey is somewhere where there are definite stresses there for sure in parts of mediterranean africa but these are not anything beyond the norm that we experience every year theres unfortunately some part of the world that always has an issue andrew light thanks and can i ask a followup on your forward order book you’ve got a fairly healthy pipeline of deliveries through to  and then it drops down quite considerably at what point will you need to think about an order placement through say  onwards aengus kelly only when we feel that there is a fair risk and reward from the manufacturers we certainly are not here to fill their backlogs were here to make money for our shareholders and if there is an attractive transaction with the manufacturers then thats fine if not i’ve no problem not buying a single airplane from them ever again but it has to be something that makes money for our shareholders and if there are deals are there tomorrow that make that happen great and if they never come i dont care operator we will take our next question from arren cyganovich of da davidson please go ahead your line is open arren cyganovich thanks gus how is the strong dollar impacting your customer base is there any discussion about changes in us trade policy et cetera that would make you a little worried about stressing some of your customer base strengthening dollar aengus kelly i think its too early to tell if there will be protectionism around the world all i can say is that the benefits of liberalization of air travel have been extraordinary boosts for the consumer globally as i just mentioned it is cheaper now to fly anywhere in the world in absolute dollar terms than it was  years ago even without adjusting for inflation thats a tremendous boon for the customer and thats the result of liberalization protectionism will i can assure you the customer will pay an awful lot more for air travel once there is protectionism thats what created southwest created ryanair created emirates all of these airlines have changed the face of air travel or air asia in asia so i think that if that were to happen it would really hurt the average guy in the street now the strong dollar itself that has happened certainly in some jurisdictions in particularly in mexico of course we have seen the impact there the airlines are so far coping with it it may well  if theres two sides to it of course look if an airline is weak this may push it over the edge we dont see anything unusual there in that level of activity beyond the norm with airline stress however it does of course mean that airlines in those jurisdictions are so much less likely to buy the assets themselves as the large dollar expenditure may not be as financeable as it was and therefore the leaseback may be a more attractive alternative arren cyganovich thanks and then looking at your maintenance rents for the quarter they were elevated were there any defaults or lease terminations that were unexpected that generated this quarter keith helming yeah we had a higher level of lease terminations that we essentially due to negotiated terminations with the airlines and so that led to what happens in those cases is we tend to sweep the maintenance reserves because the maintenance didnt perform in the air craft so the aircrafts returned to us and we recognized those revenues so thats why you saw both the higher level of maintenance revenues in the quarter and also a higher level of leasing expenses arren cyganovich got it and then just lastly for modeling purposes whats the dollar amount of capex looking like on a quarterly basis for the next two quarters keith helming well it moves around quartertoquarter but as i said for the full year that will be about  billion for  pete juhas of which probably about  is in the first half operator we will take our next question from scott valentin of compass point please go ahead your line is open scott valentin thanks for taking my question just with regard to the moodys upgrade does that impact your outlook at all for your cost of funds outlook i know youve given guidance in november for a net spread i’m just wondering if the upgrade has any positive impact or no impact at all keith helming well we have factored in a little improvement relative to where we were back in november when we gave the forecast so we expected to see some improvements there id say we have seen spreads come in a little obviously since we did our deal our bond deal and since we had the moodys upgrade in the other hand weve also seen some higher interest rates  higher rates in the meantime so those probably offset each other in terms of where we are so in terms of our forecast overall were pretty much still within the range that we gave you in november scott valentin okay thanks and then just a followup on that point the decision to move away from the adjusted earnings just gaap earnings how should we think about the previous guidance i think it was  to  was a core number before the gain on sale of any aircraft just wondering is that a number to use going forward for and add an assumption on gain on sale to get the gaap number is that the way we should think about it keith helming yeah i would still use that number so id say were still within the range that we gave you then if you think about the adjustment items that we had included those were really two one was the maintenance rates amortization impact that we talked about earlier of  million so id factor that and the other was aeroturbine losses of around  million so if you add those back those would  or adjust for those that would give you the core on a reported basis and then yeah i would add gains to that whatever your expectation is on gain operator we will take our next question from christopher nolan of fbr and company please go ahead your line is open christopher nolan hey thanks gus for your earlier comments in terms of people travelling one to one ago again put the exception of anyone have gone a long trip in the back of an md  i think theyll put you off travelling for a little while another point the capex for  billion the slide deck on page  shows  billion for  what’s the difference there keith helming  billion of cash is what we expect in terms of contracted capex it’s a little over  billion youve got the pdps to be added on christopher nolan got you and then also the  million share repurchase program is this just a upscale of the  that was previously announced to go through  or was this a separate announcement keith helming this is a new program in addition to that one christopher nolan okay so we’ve got  through  and  on top of that keith helming thats correct christopher nolan finally on the lease sale margins which are up are you seeing the value or are these aircraft being sold with leases i presume and that is driving prices now than just the metal pete juhas all aircraft that we sell are with leases attached christopher nolan and so whats driving up the margins i think you addressed this earlier but it wasn’t quite clear keith helming yeah so we had a higher margin in the fourth quarter but again i think its really due to we just had some aircraft most of these were part of big sales big portfolio sales and so we had lower margins in the third quarter higher in the fourth quarter they tend to even out and so thats why i say i think if you look at  the reason why we gave or we provided the margin for the full year is i think thats more representative of what you would see rather than any particular quarter christopher nolan okay final question on the order book again and i know you answered this a little bit earlier it seems like the order book is running down by  or running off by  by value is the strategy here does it start capitalizing on contention deferrals or airlines that might have over ordered because it looks like the early order slots for the aneo and max are pretty much taken up keith helming yeah its about  give or take i suppose the total capex will go through it in  but thats plan d look as i said earlier if there is a deal there to be done with the oems at the track then thats fine if there isnt i couldnt care less there will be plenty of opportunity for the company weve always demonstrated that in the past so im not particularly bothered about the oems operator we will take our next question from jason arnold of rbc capital markets please go ahead jason arnold hi guys sorry for the telecom issue there just curious any aircraft types in particular that youre seeing stronger appeal for perhaps lack of interest from your airline customers at present aengus kelly i think on the new technology stuff the aneo is certainly extremely liquid assets and is proving itself to be a very liquid airplane were moving in fact this week just earlier on sunday of this week we agreed to do it for another five airplanes in  thats i suppose the most liquid asset out there then you have  max  is doing well and we dont have any max s we dont have any max s we think the max  is a very good airplane on the s you heard my commentary earlier we think that the  is a liquid machine and on the a side we think the  is a liquid machine and thats evidence by our own actions in that all of our s are s and on the  side everything we could we put in to  and have no s jason arnold okay super thanks and then i guess the other one i was curious on is any updated thoughts on iran as an opportunity set or is complications from geopolitical factor there problematic aengus kelly once we have more clarity on iran it is a market that we will carefully look at but under no circumstances will we violate any sanctions and the issue is that while you could say sanctions are lifted its day one risk has been eliminated or we release however we are entering into a transaction for a multiyear period and when we put an airplane in there are other parties as part of that transaction theres the financiers and theres the insurers and ourselves the owners are you guys the owners and what we have to look at is what has happened in the event if there were to be a snap back of sanctions how would that impact your insurance policy or your financing structure and you need to have clarity over that so its multiple parties have to get comfortable with that potential and that process is ongoing and once theres clarity around that well know what action to take operator we will take our next question from kristine liwag of bank of american merrill lynch please go ahead your line is open kristine liwag hi good morning everyone can you quantify if any late payments from your airline customers today and how they compared to last year and are there particular regions of the world where that may be in your watch list this year that you didnt have last year aengus kelly well kristine there has been no great movement in receivables and you can see that when we file the quarterly reports one way or the other the jurisdictions have moved each year unfortunately some part of the world is always in trouble its a big world and things happen so at the moment turkey as i mentioned earlier on is under pressure we are starting to see a turn in brazil its a slow turn but its coming we feel and we are also seeing a real turn in russia and it generally takes these markets a couple of years to turn but on a global basis theres no absolute change and in terms of regions shifted more as i said to turkey in some parts of the mediterranean africa kristine liwag and earlier you mentioned how protectionism is a key risk to global airline industry so when you discuss this with your airline customers to what degree are they thinking about the risk of possible renegotiations of us open skies agreement and how much flexibility are they building into their fleet planning aengus kelly well i think look no one is willing to change their fleet plan at the moment it’s too uncertain every action has a reaction though i think many of them would hope in their heart of hearts for the status quo even though some may be tempted by an oligopoly i think in their heart of hearts they would be afraid of what would happen if there was to be a return to protectionism across the world it certainly wouldnt do any favors for the traveling public thats for sure kristine liwag great and maybe one last question for me with the  billion placeholder for aircraft sales this year can you discuss the expected profile of this fleet compared to your existing fleet and also is that  gain on sales still a reasonable expectation in  aengus kelly well the gain on sale is driven by the type of airplanes we sell i would just look back kristine over the last decade and you can see a consistent gain on sale in the business in terms of the type of assets we’ll sell i would expect it to be more of the same of what we sold last year with the focus on the midlife asset between  and   years of age operator we will take our final question from gary liebowitz of wells fargo securities please go ahead your line is open gary liebowitz yes thanks operator pete not to beat the dead horse here but going back to the guidance of  to  for this year that was on a core eps basis are you saying we should reduce that by about  of share or the items that are included in gaap you had excluded that on top of that and our estimate of trading gains pete juhas yeah gary what i’m saying is if you were to we gave that out on kind of an adjusted basis obviously right so if you were to convert that to reported really there are two main items in that one is the maintenance rates amortization impact which is  million so depending on your assumption about share count right that’s  you would factor that in and then the other one is the aeroturbine results which we gave was  million so if you’re going from adjusted to reported you would deduct both of those i think and then obviously you have to think about what you would expect in terms of gains on sale i think those are the three items gary liebowitz okay and then just one gus you stopped disclosing the average duration of new leases and releases what kind of trends are you seeing there especially with respect to widebody aircraft aengus kelly nothing different gary to be fair were still seeing the new stuff as i said we just signed a handful of them on sunday for  years and the used stuff bounces around four five year category nothing different there gary liebowitz were those widebody placements for  years aengus kelly they were narrow body aengus kelly well thank you all very much for joining us on the call and we look forward to seeing a number of you tomorrow in new york and on thursday and speaking again in may thank you very much thank you
