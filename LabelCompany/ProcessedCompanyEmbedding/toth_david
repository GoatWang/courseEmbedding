image these products were created by scanning an original printed edition most older books are in scanned image format because original digital layout files never existed or were no longer available from the publisher for pdf download editions each page has been run through optical character recognition ocr software to attempt to decipher the printed text the result of this ocr process is placed invisibly behind the picture of each scanned page to allow for text searching however any text in a given book set on a graphical background or in handwritten fonts would most likely not be picked up by the ocr software and is therefore not searchable also a few larger books may be resampled to fit into the system and may not have this searchable text background for printed books we have performed highresolution scans of an original hardcopy of the book we essentially digitally remaster the book unfortunately the resulting quality of these books is not as high its the problem of making a copy of a copy the text is fine for reading but illustration work starts to run dark pixellating andor losing shades of grey moiré patterns may develop in photos we mark clearly which print titles come from scanned image books so that you can make an informed purchase decision about the quality of what you will receive original electronic format these ebooks were created from the original electronic layout files and therefore are fully text searchable also their file size tends to be smaller than scanned image books most newer books are in the original electronic format both download and print editions of such books should be high quality file last updated march   this title was added to our catalog on march   publisher info flying buffalo publisher average rating see all reviews publisher
