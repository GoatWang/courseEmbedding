unilever hul reported a  per cent rise in profit after tax at rs  crore for the june quarter compared with rs  crore profit estimate by analysts in an etnow poll the fmcg major had reported rs  crore profit for the corresponding quarter last year revenue for the quarter came in at rs  crore up  per cent yoy over rs  crore reported in the same quarter last year volume growth remained flat the company said in a bse filing the company said that sentiment during the quarter was cautious in the run up to gst rollout it noted that despite high promotional intensity stock pipelines remained low and varied across categories channels and geographies ebitda margins expanded  basis points the company said the company was expected not to see gstrelated destocking as severe as witnessed during the demonetisation phase analysts noted that while there was no impact on consumer demand during the quarter destocking by wholesalers was visible owing to the fact that the share of wholesale was lower for hul the impact was expected to be lesser for hul against the expectation for many other staple companies cost of goods sold fell  basis points while the company maintained advertisement and promotion spends during the quarter zerobased budgeting zbb helped drive aampp percentage down by  bps and other expenses down by  bps the company said ebitda for the quarter rose  per cent it said transition to gst was swift and smooth starting from day  the company saiditc tanks  after gst council hikes cess on cigarettescigarette makers were choking in trade with market leader itc being hit the worst its stock falling as much as  per cent to rs  on the bse which reduced its market value to rs  lakh crore compared to yesterdays closing value of rs  lakh crore the slump comes on the back of the gst goods and services tax council led by finance minister arun jaitley hiking compensation cess on cigarettes the hike came into effect from the midnight of monday and tuesday the sensex tanked as much as  points while the nifty briefly slipped below the  mark to  losses in the market were led by itc which has the second highest weightage  per cent in the broader nifty salttohotels conglomerate itcs cigarette division contributes nearly twothirds of the fmcg fast moving consumer goods sector majors total revenues over  per cent of itcs revenues come from its cigarettes business brokerage firm macquarie said the increase in cess is clearly a negative for itc the increase in overall taxes higher retail prices would impact cigarette volume and earnings adversely it said the compensation cess on cigarettes consists of two components  an ad valorem tax of  per cent and another numerical cess on each category of filter and nonfilter varieties while the ad valorem has remained the same the numerical cess linked to the length of cigarettes was increased by the council for nonfilter  mm cigarettes the numerical cess has been raised to rs  per  units for nonfilter  mm cigarettes it is rs  per  units for filter category  mm cigarettes will be charged rs  per  units  mm will be charged rs  per  units and  mm will be charged rs  per  units for other filter cigarettes the ad valorem has been increased to  per cent plus rs  per  units whether cigarette makers will increase prices is currently unclear however brokerages believe the companies would have to hike prices in order to protect margins the increase in cess would bring in rs  crore of additional tax revenue which otherwise would have gone to the manufacturers jaitley said after the emergency meeting that

information presents managements expectations beliefs plans and objectives regarding future financial performance and assumptions or judgments concerning such performance any discussions contained in this press release except to the extent that they contain historical facts are forwardlooking and accordingly involve estimates assumptions judgments and uncertainties factors that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those addressed in the forwardlooking information include but are not limited to the strength of construction home improvement and remodeling markets and the recovery of the homebuilding industry to levels consistent with the historical average of total housing starts the cyclical nature of our industry the uncertainties resulting from the changes to policies and laws following the us election in november  the cost of environmental compliance including actual expenses we may incur to resolve proceedings we are involved in arising out of a formerly

ended december   filed with the securities and exchange commission and in other reports filed by huttig with the securities and exchange commission from time to time nongaap financial measures huttig supplements its reporting of net income with nongaap measurement of adjusted ebitda this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for gaap measures huttig defines adjusted ebitda as net income adjusted for interest income taxes depreciation and amortization and other special significant items as listed in the table below huttig presents adjusted ebitda because it is a primary measure used by management and by similar companies in the industry to evaluate operating performance and huttig believes it enhances investors’ overall understanding of the financial performance of our business  adjusted ebitda is not a recognized term under gaap and does not purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance  huttig compensates for the limitations of using nongaap financial measures by using them to supplement gaap results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors affecting the business  because not all companies use identical calculations huttig’s presentation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies adjusted ebitda unaudited the following
