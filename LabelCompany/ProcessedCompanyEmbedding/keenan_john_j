the keenans or the peter born in 0 died and a younger brother also named peter was born and baptized in dayton                         in  at age  william keenan also appears in the city directory

and read english but neither could write which was pretty common back then   by  williams business had folded perhaps due to williams ill health  he is listed in the city directory as                keenan wm p billiards                                           n high   william p keenan died on march  or   of tuberculosis  he was  years old  four years later on feb 0  at about the age of  his

died lucille may have been born after her fathers death  the census further reports that mrs mary keenan had borne a total of  children of whom only  were surviving in    it is also interesting to note that daughter mary e keenan who had been a full  months older than edmund in 0 was only one year older than her brother a decade later  this trait she undoubtedly inherited from her mother who aged only  years during that same decade   from roughly  to  theres no record of william in columbus  he left in  as an upholsterer and reappeared  years later selling office and saloon fixtures  where did he go and why the occupational change  the 0 census gives us a clue where he was  his son edmund was born in illinois  the more complete answer lies with his three older brothers george john and peter   george first appeared in the columbus city directory in  at the age of  as a bartender  by  he was listed as a plumber which he remained until  at which time he disappears from the columbus city directory   john also began as a bartender according to the columbus city directory in 0 at the age of  although the census lists him that year as working in a buggy factory  he is not again listed until  and  as a telegraph operator at which time he too disappears  peter first appears as a plumber in  and so is probably a year younger than john as shown in the 0 census but not in the baptismal record  in  hes a plumber in  a rubber in  a laborer and in  also gone  where did they go   note the columbus city directory lists a peter m keenan as residing with the family from  and a george in   these were likely relatives newly immigrated perhaps johns brothers nephews or even his aged father   george in  and his brothers john and peter in  went to chicago  the earliest record of them appears in the chicago architects contractors and material dealers directory of  which lists                keenan bros store and office fittings   two years later the lakeside annual business directory lists                keenan bros george j  john j  peter m beer pumps                                                                                         0 washington       tel                          keenan bros mnfg co george j keenan pres john j  keenan sec                                                             office fixtures    00 washington   apparently their joint bartending and plumbing backgrounds had paid off  the  lakeside directory listed keenan bros mnfg co under both store and office fixtures and beer pumps much like our modern yellow pages   the  lakeside directory lists in the alphabetical section                keenan bros mnfg co                     saloon fixtures            washington                                                                                                                           0 s central ave in the businessgroupings section under store and office fixtures keenan bros mnfg is again listed but they no longer appear under beer pumps however there is a h t shannon mfg co listed under that heading that advertized itself as the maker of the keenan hydraulic air compressor  my guess is that one of the brothers probably george had invented an improved beer pump back around  and about 0 years later sold the rights to it to mr shannon after diversifying into other product lines   in the meantime though william had joined his brothers in the family venture around  learned the trade and then returned to columbus in  to open up his own branch of the keenan bros mnfg co  he too may have gradually moved away from the beer pump end of the business to a broader line of merchandise since my mother always described him as having run a furniture store  but then again maybe that was just an editing of the oral family history as handed down to me through mary meehan keenan catherine keenan cummins and elizabeth cummins mcgee
