distributor so it hasnt set the exact price for its product which will be sold in pairs like epipenadamis spokesman mark flather said symjepi is intended to be a lowcost alternative to epipen and similar products and the company is aiming to sell it for less than generic epipensin a note to investors evercore isi analyst umer raffat wrote that symjepi is not identical to epipen and so the price adamis sets will obviously be an important considerationcurrently epipens cost about  to  without insurance while the new generic version retails for about  to mylan which has us headquarters

end the food and drug administration having approved an affordable alternative  adamis pharmaceuticals corp nasdaqadmp generic version symjepi is the latest addition in the highly competitive space the fact that adami’s product will be much cheaper means mylan will struggle to ship as many products as it did in the past the launch could not have come at a worse time for the pharmaceutical company which has seen its market share trimmed with the launch of alternatives from the likes of kaleo auvi mylan has been the subject of immense criticism over the price it charges for its epipen products outrage from the public has already attracted the attention of legislators who asked the company to justify why it charges consumers up to  for its products  the company was later fined  million for wrongly classifying its epipen under the medicaid drug rebate program  price wars pricing wars should be a point of concern for mylan given the reaction that adamis got on announcing the approval of symjepi by the fda “pricing is on everyone’s mind as it should be given all of the pricing controversies around epipen pricing for symjepi hasn’t been determined yet as that will be set around the time of the launch … adamis does intend to position this product as the lowcost alternative to the other offerings in this market” said adamis spokesperson  symjepi’s cost advantage is not the only thing that mylan will have to worry about  the new prefilled syringe is not an autoinjector taking its ease of use to another level  the fact that some doctors struggle to use autoinjectors helps bolster the case of why symjepi could be an attractive prospect for the mass market  adami’s product is also highly portable at four inches long something that observers believe will give it a competitive edge against the other alternatives  mylan might have to rethink its epipen strategy if it is to generate any sales going forward mylan stock was up by  in monday’s trading session ending

adamisrecent crl should shake investor confidence in managementcrl is good news for mylan who has the only epinephrine product on the market adamis pharmaceuticals nasdaqadmp shareholders received negative news yesterday when the fda announced that it issued a crl for adamis epinephrine prefilled syringe this decision was unexpected as i was projecting that adamis would obtain an fda approval instead of being rejected for adamis shareholders this decision by the fda could have a large impact on adamis ability to compete against other epinephrine products and the decision left only one clear winner mylan nasdaqmyl crl the fda was concerned about some of the improvements that adamis made to the device which was in response to some initial concerns from the fda essentially the fda is saying that adamis will need to expand its human factors study and reliability study in order to examine if the changes had any effect on usability on a positive note the fda indicated that adamis did solve the volume delivery issue which was the subject of an initial crl from the fda timeline adamis investors should be encouraged as the company stated that it should be able to have its study expanded and results within a short amount of time and at an immaterial cost the real question though will be how long a short amount of time is every delay for adamis is time for its competitor antares nasdaqatrs which is developing its own epinephrine product with teva nyseteva to catch up as i mentioned in a previous article the first epinephrine product to the market will have a substantial advantage versus mylan by being able to barely undercut them in price and gain significant marketshare having multiple competing products however will cause large pricing pressure and make the product less profitable even with a large partner that adamis has in its partner allergan nyseagn the pricing pressure is still likely to be the case it is also unclear as to the timeline for once adamis submits a response as to how the fda will classify the response and whether there is any chance for the fda to render an approval decision it will be important for adamis to have a response as quickly as possible but to also get it right this time adamis has experienced too many delays with this product and investors are understandably frustrated about the fact that management has not been able to deliver the longer that a generic epinephrine product is able to stay off the market the more lucrative it is for mylan myl which currently has the epipen investors will need to see a quick response from adamis and will need to rebuild confidence in management after an inability to execute up to this point concerns moving forward without an approved product from the fda investors should have concerns about all of adamis pipeline while adamis does appear to have a solid pipeline of promising products most of which are using the b pathway the ability of management to get caught up on relatively minor problems should be a concern with adamis trying to enter already heavily crowded marketplaces it will need to continue to rely upon its ability to attract partners to market its products with a management history of delays partners could wait until much later in the approval process or until adamis has approval in hand before partnering another concern is that the value of the pipeline could be adversely affected by a history of managements inability to see a product through to the finish line this is the second crl for adamis and while management may have history from other companies about being able to execute the market will have a short memory for management it is important that management continues to try to restore investor confidence after this setback conclusion moving forward investors should make sure that there is a very clear timeline for an fda response investors will also need to watch the progress by competitors in order to make sure that adamis is the first company to the market with a generic epinephrine product any further delays could give the competition time to surpass adamis it is also concerning that the management at adamis has now had two delays in getting the product approved it will be important for management to rebuild confidence disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any
