taking steps to roll up many of its nontraded reits including the following american realty capital – retail centers of america inc american realty capital healthcare trust iii inc american realty capital global trust ii inc and realty finance trust inc on april   arcrca filed a proxy statement with the sec setting the companys annual meeting for june    therein the defendants recommended that arcrcas shareholders vote at the annual meeting to approve numerous amendments to the companys articles of amendment and restatement the charter  as more fully detailed in the complaint approval of the proposed amendments to the charter will eliminate valuable shareholder protections and rights currently enjoyed by arcrcas shareholders under the charter including the right to an independent appraisal of the companys value in connection with a roll up transaction and the ability to receive a pro rata share of the companys appraised value in cash as well as protections concerning the companys ability to engage in conflicted transactions with related parties as further detailed in the complaint although the defendants seek to eliminate valuable protections currently enjoyed by arcrca shareholders under the companys charter the proxy statements explanation for why shareholder approval is sought for amendments to the charter is materially misleading and incomplete  for example the proxy statement fails to disclose that ar global has already taken steps to roll up arcrca and other nontraded reits controlled by ar global into american finance trust inc – another nontraded reit controlled by ar global  the proxy statement is also materially misleading and incomplete with respect to disclosures concerning proposed amendments to the charter that would eliminate conflicts of interest protections and restrictions on the companys advisor american realty capital retail advisor llc which manages the daytoday affairs of the company and is also controlled by ar global  finally the proxy statement improperly bundles multiple unrelated charter amendments in single voting proposals illegally requiring arcrca shareholders to vote up or down a number of proposals
