fourthranked as a spoken first language the country is one of the few in africa never to have had a coup détat and regular elections have been held for almost a century however the vast majority of black south africans were not enfranchised until  during the twentieth century the black majority sought to recover its rights from the dominant white minority with this struggle playing a large role in the countrys recent history and politics the national party imposed the apartheid system in  institutionalising previous racial segregation after a long and sometimes violent struggle by the

recovered from a series of caves in gauteng province the area is a unesco world heritage site and has been termed the cradle of humankind the sites include sterkfontein which is one of the richest hominin fossil sites in the world other sites include swartkrans gondolin cave kromdraai coopers cave and malapa the first hominin fossil discovered in africa the taung child was found near taung in  further hominin remains have been recovered from the sites of makapansgat in limpopo cornelia and florisbad in the free state border cave in kwazulunatal klasies river mouth in eastern cape and pinnacle point elandsfontein and die kelders cave in western cape these sites suggest that various hominid species existed in south africa from about three million years ago starting with australopithecus africanus these were succeeded by various species including australopithecus sediba homo ergaster homo erectus homo rhodesiensis homo helmei homo naledi and modern humans homo sapiens modern humans have inhabited southern africa for at least  years within the vaal river valley pebble tools have been located bantu expansion mapungubwe hill the site of the former capital of the kingdom of mapungubwe settlements of bantuspeaking peoples who were ironusing agriculturists and herdsmen were already present south of the limpopo river now the northern border with botswana and zimbabwe by the th or th century ce see bantu expansion they displaced conquered and absorbed the original khoisan speakers the khoikhoi and san peoples the bantu slowly moved south the earliest ironworks in modernday kwazulunatal province are believed to date from around  the southernmost group was the xhosa people whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier khoisan people the xhosa reached the great fish river in todays eastern cape province as they migrated these larger iron age populations displaced or assimilated earlier peoples in mpumalanga several stone circles have been found along with the stone arrangement that has been named adams calendar portuguese contacts at the time of european contact the dominant ethnic group were bantuspeaking peoples who had migrated from other parts of africa about one thousand years before the two major historic groups were the xhosa and zulu peoples in  the portuguese explorer bartolomeu dias led the first european voyage to land in southern africa on  december he landed at walfisch bay now known as walvis bay in presentday namibia this was south of the furthest point reached in  by his predecessor the portuguese navigator diogo cão cape cross north of the bay dias continued down the western coast of southern africa after  january  prevented by storms from proceeding along the coast he sailed out of sight of land and passed the southernmost point of africa without seeing it he reached as far up the eastern coast of africa as what he called rio do infante probably the presentday groot river in may  but on his return he saw the cape which he first named cabo das tormentas cape of storms his king john ii renamed the point cabo da boa esperança or cape of good hope as it led to the riches of the east indies dias feat of navigation was later immortalised in luís de camões portuguese epic poem the lusiads  dutch colonisation see also history of cape colony and dutch cape colony charles davidson bells thcentury painting of jan van riebeeck who founded the first european settlement in south africa arrives in table bay in  by the early th century portugals maritime power was starting to decline and english and dutch merchants competed to oust lisbon from its lucrative monopoly on the spice trade representatives of the british east india company did call sporadically at the cape in search of provisions as early as  but later came to favour ascension island and st helena as alternative ports of refuge dutch interest was aroused after  when two employees of the dutch east india company voc were shipwrecked there for several months the sailors were able to survive by obtaining fresh water and meat from the natives they also sowed vegetables in the fertile soil upon their return to holland they reported favourably on the capes potential as a warehouse and garden for provisions to stock passing ships for long voyages in  a century and a half after the discovery of the cape sea route jan van riebeeck established a victualing station at the cape of good hope at what would become cape town on behalf of the dutch east india company in time the cape become home to a large population of vrijlieden also known as vrijburgers free citizens former company employees who stayed in dutch territories overseas after serving their contracts dutch traders also imported thousands of slaves to the fledgling colony from indonesia madagascar and parts of eastern africa some of the earliest mixed race communities in the country were later formed through unions between vrijburgers their slaves and various indigenous peoples this led to the development of a new ethnic group the cape coloureds most of whom adopted the dutch language and christian faith the eastward expansion of dutch colonists ushered in a series of wars with the southwesterly migrating xhosa tribe as both sides competed for the pastureland necessary to graze their cattle near the great fish river vrijburgers who became independent farmers on the frontier were known as boers with some adopting seminomadic lifestyles being denoted as trekboers the boers formed loose militias which they termed commandos and forged alliances with khoisan groups to repel xhosa raids both sides launched bloody but inconclusive offensives and sporadic violence often accompanied by livestock theft remained common for several decades british colonisation great britain occupied cape town between  and  to prevent it from falling under the control of the french first republic which had invaded the low countries despite briefly returning to dutch rule under the batavian republic in  the cape was occupied again by the british in  following the end of the napoleonic wars it was formally ceded to great britain and became an integral part of the british empire british immigration to south africa began around  subsequently culminating in the arrival of the  settlers the new colonists were induced to settle for a variety of reasons namely to increase the size of the european workforce and to bolster frontier regions against xhosa incursions depiction of a zulu attack on a boer camp in february  in the first two decades of the th century the zulu people grew in power and expanded their territory under their leader shaka shakas warfare led indirectly to the mfecane crushing that devastated and depopulated the inland plateau in the early s an offshoot of the zulu the matabele people created a larger empire that included large parts of the highveld under their king mzilikazi during the early s many dutch settlers departed from the cape colony where they had been subjected to british control they migrated to the future natal orange free state and transvaal regions the boers founded the boer republics the south african republic now gauteng limpopo mpumalanga and north west provinces and the orange free state free state the discovery of diamonds in  and gold in  in the interior started the mineral revolution and increased economic growth and immigration this intensified british efforts to gain control over the indigenous peoples the struggle to control these important economic resources was a factor in relations between europeans and the indigenous population and also between the boers and the british the anglozulu war was fought in  between the british empire and the zulu kingdom following lord carnarvons successful introduction of federation in canada it was thought that similar political effort coupled with military campaigns might succeed with the african kingdoms tribal areas and boer republics in south africa in  sir henry bartle frere was sent to south africa as high commissioner for the british empire to bring such plans into being among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the south african republic and the kingdom of zululand and its army the zulu nation spectacularly defeated the british at the battle of isandlwana eventually though the war was lost resulting in the end of the zulu nations independence boers in combat  the boer republics successfully resisted british encroachments during the first boer war – using guerrilla warfare tactics which were well suited to local conditions the british returned with greater numbers more experience and new strategy in the second boer war – but suffered heavy casualties through attrition nonetheless they were ultimately successful independence within the country antibritish policies among white south africans focused on independence during the dutch and british colonial years racial segregation was mostly informal though some legislation was enacted to control the settlement and movement of native people including the native location act of  and the system of pass laws eight years after the end of the second boer war and after four years of negotiation an act of the british parliament south africa act  granted nominal independence while creating the union of south africa on  may  the union was a dominion that included the former territories of the cape and natal colonies as well as the republics of orange free state and transvaal the natives land act of  severely restricted the ownership of land by blacks at that stage natives controlled only  of the country the amount of land reserved for indigenous peoples was later marginally increased in  the union was fully sovereign from the united kingdom with the passage of the statute of westminster which abolished the last powers of the british government on the country in  the south african party and national party merged to form the united party seeking reconciliation between afrikaners and englishspeaking whites in  the party split over the entry of the union into world war ii as an ally of the united kingdom a move which the national party followers strongly opposed beginning of apartheid for use by white persons – apartheid sign in  the national party was elected to power it strengthened the racial segregation begun under dutch and british colonial rule the nationalist government classified all peoples into three races and developed rights and limitations for each the white minority less than  controlled the vastly larger black majority the legally institutionalised segregation became known as apartheid while whites enjoyed the highest standard of living in all of africa comparable to first world western nations the black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard including income education housing and life expectancy the freedom charter adopted in  by the congress alliance demanded a nonracial society and an end to discrimination republic on  may  the country became a republic following a referendum in which white voters narrowly voted in favour thereof the britishdominated natal province rallied against the issue queen elizabeth ii was stripped of the title queen of south africa and the last governorgeneral namely charles robberts swart became state president as a concession to the westminster system the presidency remained parliamentary appointed and virtually powerless until p w bothas constitution act of  which intact in these regards eliminated the office of prime minister and instated a nearunique strong presidency responsible to parliament pressured by other commonwealth of nations countries south africa withdrew from the organisation in  and rejoined it only in  despite opposition both within and outside the country the government legislated for a continuation of apartheid the security forces cracked down on internal dissent and violence became widespread with antiapartheid organisations such as the african national congress the azanian peoples organisation and the panafricanist congress carrying out guerrilla warfare and urban sabotage the three rival resistance movements also engaged in occasional interfactional clashes as they jockeyed for domestic influence apartheid became increasingly controversial and several countries began to boycott business with the south african government because of its racial policies these measures were later extended to international sanctions and the divestment of holdings by foreign investors f w de klerk and nelson mandela shake hands in january  in the late s south africa initiated a programme of nuclear weapons development in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons end of apartheid the mahlabatini declaration of faith signed by mangosuthu buthelezi and harry schwarz in  enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all the first of such agreements by black and white political leaders in south africa ultimately f w de klerk opened bilateral discussions with nelson mandela in  for a transition of policies and government in  the national party government took the first step towards dismantling discrimination when it lifted the ban on the african national congress and other political organisations it released nelson mandela from prison after twentyseven years serving a sentence for sabotage a negotiation process followed with approval from a predominantly white referendum the government repealed apartheid legislation south africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty south africa held its first universal elections in  which the anc won by an overwhelming majority it has been in power ever since the country rejoined the commonwealth of nations and became a member of the southern african development community sadc nelson mandela first black african president of republic of south africa in postapartheid south africa unemployment has been extremely high as the country has struggled with many changes while many blacks have risen to middle or upper classes the overall unemployment rate of blacks worsened between  and  poverty among whites previously rare increased in addition the current government has struggled to achieve the monetary and fiscal discipline to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth since the ancled government took power the united nations human development index of south africa has fallen while it was steadily rising until the mids some may be attributed to the hivaids pandemic and the failure of the government to take steps to address it in the early years in may  riots left over sixty people dead the centre on housing rights and evictions estimates over  people were driven from their homes the targets were mainly migrants and refugees seeking asylum but a third of the victims were south african citizens in a  survey the south african migration project concluded that south africans are more opposed to immigration than anywhere else in the world the united nations high commissioner for refugees in  reported over  refugees applied for asylum in south africa almost four times as many as the year before these people were mainly from zimbabwe though many also come from burundi democratic republic of the congo rwanda eritrea ethiopia and somalia competition over jobs business opportunities public services and housing has led to tension between refugees and host communities while xenophobia is still a problem recent violence has not been as widespread as initially feared geography main article geography of south africa a map of south africa showing the main topographic features the central plateau edged by the great escarpment and the cape fold belt in the southwest corner of the country important geographical regions in south africa the thick line traces the course of the great escarpment which edges the central plateau the eastern portion of this line coloured red is known as the drakensberg the escarpment rises to its highest point at over  m where the drakensberg forms the border between kwazulunatal and lesotho none of the regions indicated on the map has a sharp welldefined border except where the escarpment or a range of mountains forms a clear dividing line between two regions some of the better known regions are coloured in the others are simply indicated by their names as they would be in an atlas south africa is located at the southernmost region of africa with a long coastline that stretches more than  km  mi and along two oceans the south atlantic and the indian at  km  sq mi south africa is the thlargest country in the world and is comparable in size to colombia mafadi in the drakensberg at  m  ft is the highest peak in south africa excluding the prince edward islands the country lies between latitudes ° and °s and longitudes ° and °e the interior of south africa consists of a vast in most places almost flat plateau with an altitude of between  m  ft and  m  ft highest in the east and sloping gently downwards towards the west and north and slightly less noticeably so to the south and southwest this plateau is surrounded by the great escarpment whose eastern and highest stretch is known as the drakensberg the south and southwestern parts of the plateau at approximately – m above sea level and the adjoining plain below at approximately – m above sea level – see map on the right is known as the great karoo which consists of sparsely populated scrubland to the north the great karoo fades into the even drier and more arid bushmanland which eventually becomes the kalahari desert in the very northwest of the country the mideastern and highest part of the plateau is known as the highveld this relatively wellwatered area is home to a great proportion of the country’s commercial farmlands and contains its largest conurbation gauteng province to the north of highveld from about the °  s line of latitude the plateau slopes downwards into the bushveld which ultimately gives way to the limpopo lowlands or lowveld flat topped hills called karoo koppies are highly characteristic of the southern and southwestern karoo landscape these hills are capped by hard erosion resistant dolerite sills this is solidified lava that was forced under high pressure between the horizontal strata of the sedimentary rocks that make up most of the karoo’s geology about  million years ago since then southern africa has undergone a prolonged period of erosion removing the relatively soft karoo rocks except where they are protected by a cap of dolerite this photograph was taken near cradock in the eastern cape the coastal belt below the great escarpment moving clockwise from the northeast consists of the limpopo lowveld which merges into the mpumalanga lowveld below the mpumalanga drakensberg the eastern portion of the great escarpment this is hotter drier and less intensely cultivated than the highveld above the escarpment the kruger national park located in the provinces of limpopo and mpumalanga in northeastern south africa occupies a large portion of the lowveld covering  square kilometres  sq mi  south of the lowveld the annual rainfall increases as one enters kwazulunatal province which especially near the coast is subtropically hot and humid the kwazulunatal – lesotho international border is formed by the highest portion of the great escarpment or drakensberg which reaches an altitude of over  m  ft the climate at the foot of this part of the drakensberg is temperate drakensberg the eastern and highest portion of the great escarpment which surrounds the east south and western borders of the central plateau of southern africa the coastal belt below the south and southwestern stretches of the great escarpment contains several ranges of cape fold mountains which run parallel to the coast separating the great escarpment from the ocean these parallel ranges of fold mountains are shown on the map above left note the course of the great escarpment to the north of these mountain ranges the land at approximately – m above sea level between two of these ranges of fold mountains in the south ie between the outeniqua and langeberg ranges to the south and the swartberg range to the north is known as the little karoo which consists of semidesert scrubland similar to that of the great karoo except that its northern strip along the foothills of the swartberg mountains has a somewhat higher rainfall and is therefore more cultivated than the great karoo the little karoo is historically and still famous for its ostrich farming around the town of oudtshoorn the lowland area – m above sea level to the north of the swartberg mountain range up to the great escarpment is the lowland part of the great karoo see map at top right which is climatically and botanically almost indistinguishable from the karoo above the great escarpment the narrow coastal strip between the most seaward cape fold mountain range ie the langeberg–outeniqua mountains and the ocean has a moderately high yearround rainfall especially in the georgeknysnaplettenberg bay region which is known as the garden route it is famous for the most extensive areas of indigenous forests in south africa a generally forestpoor country in the southwest corner of the country the cape peninsula forms the southernmost tip of the coastal strip which borders the atlantic ocean and ultimately terminates at the country’s border with namibia at the orange river the cape peninsula has a mediterranean climate making it and its immediate surrounds the only portion of africa south of the sahara which receives most of its rainfall in winter the greater cape town metropolitan area is situated on the cape peninsula and is home to  million people according to the  population census it is the countrys legislative capital spring flowers in namaqualand the coastal belt to the north of the cape peninsula is bounded on the west by the atlantic ocean and the first row of northsouth running cape fold mountains to the east the cape fold mountains peter out at about the ° s line of latitude after which the coastal plain is bounded by the great escarpment itself the most southerly portion of this coastal belt is known as the swartland and malmesbury plain which is an important wheat growing region relying on winter rains the region further north is known as namaqualand which becomes more and more arid as one approaches the orange river the little rain that falls tends to fall in winter which results in one of the world’s most spectacular displays of flowers carpeting huge stretches of veld in spring august–september cape floral region protected areas south africa also has one possession the small subantarctic archipelago of the prince edward islands consisting of marion island  km or  sq mi and prince edward island  km or  sq mi not to be confused with the canadian province of the same name climate main article climate of south africa köppen climate types of south africa south africa has a generally temperate climate due in part to being surrounded by the atlantic and indian oceans on three sides by its location in the climatically milder southern hemisphere and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north towards the equator and further inland due to this varied topography and oceanic influence a great variety of climatic zones exist the climatic zones range from the extreme desert of the southern namib in the farthest northwest to the lush subtropical climate in the east along the mozambique border and the indian ocean winters in south africa occur between june and august the extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the mediterranean with wet winters and hot dry summers hosting the famous fynbos biome of shrubland and thicket this area also produces much of the wine in south africa this region is also particularly known for its wind which blows intermittently almost all year the severity of this wind made passing around the cape of good hope particularly treacherous for sailors causing many shipwrecks further east on the south coast rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year producing a green landscape this area is popularly known as the garden route the free state is particularly flat because it lies centrally on the high plateau north of the vaal river the highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat johannesburg in the centre of the highveld is at  m  ft and receives an annual rainfall of  mm  in winters in this region are cold although snow is rare the high drakensberg mountains which form the southeastern escarpment of the highveld offer limited skiing opportunities in winter the coldest place on mainland south africa is sutherland in the western roggeveld mountains where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as − °c  °f the prince edward islands have colder average annual temperatures but sutherland has colder extremes the deep interior of mainland south africa has the hottest temperatures a temperature of  °c  °f was recorded in  in the northern cape kalahari near upington but this temperature is unofficial and was not recorded with standard equipment the official highest temperature is  °c  °f at vioolsdrif in january  biodiversity

animals south african giraffe kruger national park numerous mammals are found in the bushveld including transvaal lions african leopards south african cheetahs southern white rhinos blue wildebeest kudus impalas hyenas hippopotamuses and south african giraffes a significant extent of the bushveld exists in the northeast including kruger national park and the sabi sand game reserve as well as in the far north in the waterberg biosphere south africa houses many endemic species among them the critically endangered riverine rabbit bunolagus monticullaris in the karoo fungi up to  more than  species of fungi including lichenforming species had been recorded in  the total number of fungi which occur in south africa was conservatively estimated at about  species but that did not take into account fungi associated with insects if correct then the number of south african fungi dwarfs that of its plants in at least some major south african ecosystems an exceptionally high percentage of fungi are highly specific in terms of the plants with which they occur the countrys biodiversity strategy and action plan does not mention fungi including lichenforming fungi plants subtropical forest near durban lowveld vegetation of the kruger national park with more than  different higher plants or about  of all the known species of plants on earth south africa is particularly rich in plant diversity the most prevalent biome in south africa is the grassland particularly on the highveld where the plant cover is dominated by different grasses low shrubs and acacia trees mainly camelthorn and whitethorn vegetation becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low rainfall there are several species of waterstoring succulents like aloes and euphorbias in the very hot and dry namaqualand area the grass and thorn savannah turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the northeast of the country with denser growth there are significant numbers of baobab trees in this area near the northern end of kruger national park the fynbos biome which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the cape floristic region one of the six floral kingdoms is located in a small region of the western cape and contains more than  of those species making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of plant diversitycitation needed most of the plants are evergreen hardleaf plants with fine needlelike leaves such as the sclerophyllous plants another uniquely south african flowering plant group is the genus protea there are around  different species of protea in south africa while south africa has a great wealth of flowering plants only  of south africa is forest almost exclusively in the humid coastal plain of kwazulunatal where there are also areas of southern africa mangroves in river mouths there are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of fire known as montane forests plantations of imported tree species are predominant particularly the nonnative eucalyptus and pine conservation issues south africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades primarily due to overpopulation sprawling development patterns and deforestation during the th century south africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many eg black wattle port jackson willow hakea

the taung child was found near taung in  further hominin remains have been recovered from the sites of makapansgat in limpopo cornelia and florisbad in the free state border cave in kwazulunatal klasies river mouth in eastern cape and pinnacle point elandsfontein and die kelders cave in western cape these sites suggest that various hominid species existed in south africa from about three million years ago starting with australopithecus africanus these were succeeded by various species including australopithecus sediba homo ergaster homo erectus homo rhodesiensis homo helmei homo

cape colony and dutch cape colony charles davidson bells thcentury painting of jan van riebeeck who founded the first european settlement in south africa arrives in table bay in  by the early th century portugals maritime power was starting to decline and english and dutch merchants competed to oust lisbon from its lucrative monopoly on the spice trade representatives of the british east india company did call sporadically at the cape in search of provisions as early as  but later came to favour ascension island and st helena as alternative ports of refuge dutch interest was aroused after  when two employees of the dutch east india company voc were shipwrecked there for several months the sailors were able to survive by obtaining fresh water and meat from the natives they also sowed vegetables in the fertile soil upon their return to holland they reported favourably on the capes potential as a warehouse and garden for provisions to stock passing ships for long voyages in  a century and a half after the discovery of the cape sea route jan van riebeeck established a victualing station at the cape of good hope at what would become cape town on behalf of the dutch east india company in time the cape become home to a large population of vrijlieden also known as vrijburgers free citizens former company employees who stayed in dutch territories overseas after serving their contracts dutch traders also imported thousands of slaves to the fledgling colony from indonesia madagascar and parts of eastern africa some of the earliest mixed race communities in the country were later formed through unions between vrijburgers their slaves and various indigenous peoples this led to the development of a new ethnic group the cape coloureds most of whom adopted the dutch language and christian faith the eastward expansion of dutch colonists ushered in a series of wars with the southwesterly migrating xhosa tribe as both sides competed for the pastureland necessary to graze their cattle near the great fish river vrijburgers who became independent farmers on the frontier were known as boers with some adopting seminomadic lifestyles being denoted as trekboers the boers formed loose militias which they termed commandos and forged alliances with khoisan groups to repel xhosa raids both sides launched bloody but inconclusive offensives and sporadic violence often accompanied by livestock theft remained common for several decades british colonisation great britain occupied cape town between  and  to prevent it from falling under the control of the french first republic which had invaded the low countries despite briefly returning to dutch rule under the batavian republic in  the cape was occupied again by the british in  following the end of the napoleonic wars it was formally ceded to great britain and became an integral part of the british empire british immigration to south africa began around  subsequently culminating in the arrival of the  settlers the new colonists were induced to settle for a variety of reasons namely to increase the size of the european workforce and to bolster frontier regions against xhosa incursions depiction of a zulu attack on a boer camp in february  in the first two decades of the th century the zulu people grew in power and expanded their territory under their leader shaka shakas warfare led indirectly to the mfecane crushing that devastated and depopulated the inland plateau in the early s an offshoot of the zulu the matabele people created a larger empire that included large parts of the highveld under their king mzilikazi during the early s many dutch settlers departed from the cape colony where they had been subjected to british control they migrated to the future natal orange free state and transvaal regions the boers founded the boer republics the south african republic now gauteng limpopo mpumalanga and north west provinces and the orange free state free state the discovery of diamonds in  and gold in  in the interior started the mineral revolution and increased economic growth and immigration this intensified british efforts to gain control over the indigenous peoples the struggle to control these important economic resources was a factor in relations between europeans and the indigenous population and also between the boers and the british the anglozulu war was fought in  between the british empire and the zulu kingdom following lord carnarvons successful introduction of federation in canada it was thought that similar political effort coupled with military campaigns might succeed with the african kingdoms tribal areas and boer republics in south africa in  sir henry bartle frere was sent to south africa as high commissioner for the british empire to bring such plans into being among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the south african republic and the kingdom of zululand and its army the zulu nation spectacularly defeated the british at the battle of isandlwana eventually though the war was lost resulting in the end of the zulu nations independence boers in combat  the boer republics successfully resisted british encroachments during the first boer war – using guerrilla warfare tactics which were well suited to local conditions the british returned with greater numbers more experience and new strategy in the second boer war – but suffered heavy casualties through attrition nonetheless they were ultimately successful independence within the country antibritish policies among white south africans focused on independence during the dutch and british colonial years racial segregation was mostly informal though some legislation was enacted to control the settlement and movement of native people including the native location act of  and the system of pass laws eight years after the end of the second boer war and after four years of negotiation an act of the british parliament south africa act  granted nominal independence while creating the union of south africa on  may  the union was a dominion that included the former territories of the cape and natal colonies as well as the republics of orange free state and transvaal the natives land act of  severely restricted the ownership of land by blacks at that stage natives controlled only  of the country the amount of land reserved for indigenous peoples was later marginally increased in  the union was fully sovereign from the united kingdom with the passage of the statute of westminster which abolished the last powers of the british

the entry of the union into world war ii as an ally of the united kingdom a move which the national party followers strongly opposed beginning of apartheid for use by white persons – apartheid sign in  the national party was elected to power it strengthened the racial segregation begun under dutch and british colonial rule the nationalist government classified all peoples into three races and developed rights and limitations for each the white minority less than  controlled the vastly larger black majority the legally institutionalised segregation became known as apartheid while whites enjoyed the highest standard of living in all of africa comparable to first world western nations the black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard including income education housing and life expectancy the freedom charter adopted in  by the congress alliance demanded a nonracial society and an end to discrimination republic on  may  the country became a republic following a referendum in which white voters narrowly voted in favour thereof the britishdominated natal province rallied against the issue queen elizabeth ii was stripped of the title queen of south africa and the last governorgeneral namely charles robberts swart became state president as a concession to the westminster system the presidency remained parliamentary appointed and virtually powerless until p w bothas constitution act of  which intact in these regards eliminated the office of prime minister and instated a nearunique strong presidency responsible to parliament pressured by other commonwealth of nations countries south africa withdrew from the organisation in  and rejoined it only in  despite opposition both within and outside the country the government legislated for a continuation of apartheid the security forces cracked down on internal dissent and violence became widespread with antiapartheid organisations such as the african national congress the azanian peoples organisation and the panafricanist congress carrying out guerrilla warfare and urban sabotage the three rival resistance movements also engaged in occasional interfactional clashes as they jockeyed for domestic influence apartheid became increasingly controversial and several countries began to boycott business with the south african government because of its racial policies these measures were later extended to international sanctions and the divestment of holdings by foreign investors f w de klerk and nelson mandela shake hands in january  in the late s south africa initiated a programme of nuclear weapons development in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons end of apartheid the mahlabatini declaration of faith signed by mangosuthu buthelezi and harry schwarz in  enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all the first of such agreements by black and white political leaders in south africa ultimately f w de klerk opened bilateral discussions with nelson mandela in  for a transition of policies and government in  the national party government took the first step towards dismantling discrimination when it lifted the ban on the african national congress and other political organisations it released nelson mandela from prison after twentyseven years serving a sentence for sabotage a negotiation process followed with approval from a predominantly white referendum the government repealed apartheid legislation south africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty

as the drakensberg the escarpment rises to its highest point at over  m where the drakensberg forms the border between kwazulunatal and lesotho none of the regions indicated on the map has a sharp welldefined border except where the escarpment or a range of mountains forms a clear dividing line between two regions some of the better known regions are coloured in the others are simply indicated

between  m  ft and  m  ft highest in the east and sloping gently downwards towards the west and north and slightly less noticeably so to the south and southwest this plateau is surrounded by the great escarpment whose eastern and highest stretch is known as the drakensberg the south and southwestern parts of the plateau at approximately – m above sea level and the adjoining plain below at approximately – m above sea level – see map on the right is known as the great karoo which consists of sparsely populated scrubland to the north the great karoo fades into the even drier and more arid bushmanland which eventually becomes the kalahari desert in the very northwest of the country the mideastern and highest part of the plateau is known as the highveld this relatively wellwatered area is home to a great proportion of the country’s commercial farmlands and contains its largest conurbation gauteng province to the north of highveld from about the °  s line of latitude the plateau slopes downwards into the bushveld which ultimately gives way to the limpopo lowlands or lowveld flat topped hills called karoo koppies are highly characteristic of the southern and southwestern karoo landscape these hills are capped by hard erosion resistant dolerite sills this is solidified lava that was forced under high pressure between the horizontal strata of the sedimentary rocks that make up most of the karoo’s geology about  million years ago since then southern africa has undergone a prolonged period of erosion removing the relatively soft karoo rocks except where they are protected by a cap of dolerite this photograph was taken near cradock in the eastern cape the coastal belt below the great escarpment moving clockwise from the northeast consists of the limpopo lowveld which merges into the mpumalanga lowveld below the mpumalanga drakensberg the eastern portion of the great escarpment this is hotter drier and less intensely cultivated than the highveld above the escarpment the kruger national park located in the provinces of limpopo and mpumalanga in northeastern south africa occupies a large portion of the lowveld covering  square kilometres  sq mi  south of the lowveld the annual rainfall increases as one enters kwazulunatal province which especially near the coast is subtropically hot and humid the kwazulunatal – lesotho international border is formed by the highest portion of the great escarpment or drakensberg which reaches an altitude of over  m  ft the climate at the foot of this part of the drakensberg is temperate drakensberg the eastern and highest portion of the great escarpment which surrounds the east south and western borders of the central plateau of southern africa the coastal belt below the south and southwestern stretches of the great escarpment contains several ranges of cape fold mountains which run parallel to the coast separating the great escarpment from the ocean these parallel ranges of fold mountains are shown on the map above left note the course of the great escarpment to the north of these mountain ranges the land at approximately – m above sea level between two of these ranges of fold mountains in the south ie between the outeniqua and langeberg ranges to the south and the swartberg range to the north is known as the little karoo which consists of semidesert scrubland similar to that of the great karoo except that its northern strip along the foothills of the swartberg mountains has a somewhat higher rainfall and is therefore more cultivated than the great karoo the little karoo is historically and still famous for its ostrich farming around the town of oudtshoorn the lowland area – m above sea level to the north of the swartberg mountain range up to the great escarpment is the lowland part of the great karoo see map at top right which is climatically and botanically almost indistinguishable from the karoo above the great escarpment the narrow coastal strip between the most seaward cape

article climate of south africa köppen climate types of south africa south africa has a generally temperate climate due in part to being surrounded by the atlantic and indian oceans on three sides by its location in the climatically milder southern hemisphere and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north towards the equator and further inland due to this varied topography and oceanic influence a great variety of climatic zones exist the climatic zones range from the extreme desert of the southern namib in the farthest northwest to the lush subtropical climate in the east along the mozambique border and the indian ocean winters in south africa occur between june and august the extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the mediterranean with wet winters and hot dry summers hosting the famous fynbos biome of shrubland and thicket this area also produces much of the wine in south africa this region is also particularly known for its wind which blows intermittently almost all year the severity of this wind made passing around the cape of good hope particularly treacherous for sailors causing many shipwrecks further east on the south coast rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year producing a green landscape this area is popularly known as the garden route the free state is particularly flat because it lies centrally on the high plateau north of the vaal river the highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat johannesburg in the centre of the highveld is at  m  ft and receives an annual rainfall of  mm  in winters in this region are cold although snow is rare the high drakensberg mountains which form the southeastern escarpment of the highveld offer limited skiing opportunities in winter the coldest place on mainland south africa is sutherland in the western roggeveld mountains where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as − °c  °f the prince edward islands have colder average annual temperatures but sutherland has colder extremes the deep interior of mainland south africa has the hottest temperatures a temperature of  °c  °f was recorded in  in the

consists of africas largest communities of european white asian indian and multiracial coloured ancestry south africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures languages and religions its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitutions recognition of eleven official languages which is among the highest number of any country in the world two of these languages are of european origin afrikaans developed from dutch and serves as the first language of most white and coloured south africans english reflects the legacy of british colonialism and is commonly used in public and commercial life though it is fourthranked as a spoken first language the country is one of the few in africa never to have had a coup détat and regular elections have been held for almost a century however the vast majority of black south africans were not enfranchised until  during the twentieth century the black majority sought to recover its rights from the dominant white minority with this struggle playing a large role in the countrys recent history and politics the national party imposed the apartheid system in  institutionalising previous racial segregation after a long and sometimes violent struggle by the african national congress and other antiapartheid activists both inside and outside the country discriminatory laws began to be repealed or abolished from  onwards

india company did call sporadically at the cape in search of provisions as early as  but later came to favour ascension island and st helena as alternative ports of refuge dutch interest was aroused after  when two employees of the dutch east india company voc were shipwrecked there for several months the sailors were able to survive by obtaining fresh water and meat from the natives they also sowed vegetables in the fertile soil upon their return to holland they reported favourably on the capes potential as a warehouse and garden for provisions to stock passing ships for long voyages in  a century and a half after the discovery of the cape sea route jan van riebeeck established a victualing station at the cape of good hope at what would become cape town on behalf of the dutch east india company in time the cape become home to a large population of vrijlieden also known as vrijburgers free citizens former company employees who stayed in dutch territories overseas after serving their contracts dutch traders also imported thousands of slaves to the fledgling colony from indonesia madagascar and parts of eastern africa some of the earliest mixed race communities in the country were later formed through unions between vrijburgers their slaves and various indigenous peoples this led to the development of a new ethnic group the cape coloureds most of whom adopted the dutch language and christian faith the eastward expansion of dutch colonists ushered in a series of wars with the southwesterly migrating xhosa tribe as both sides competed for the pastureland necessary to graze their cattle near the great fish river vrijburgers who became independent farmers on the frontier were known as boers with some adopting seminomadic lifestyles being denoted as trekboers the boers formed loose militias which they termed commandos and forged alliances with khoisan groups to repel xhosa raids both sides launched bloody but inconclusive offensives and sporadic violence often accompanied by livestock theft remained common for several decades british colonisation great britain occupied cape town between  and  to prevent it from falling under the control of the french first republic which had invaded the low countries despite briefly returning to dutch rule under the batavian republic in  the cape was occupied again by the british in  following the end of the napoleonic wars it was formally ceded to great britain and became an integral part of the british empire british immigration to south africa began around  subsequently culminating in the arrival of the  settlers the new colonists were induced to settle for a variety of reasons namely to increase the size of the european workforce and to bolster frontier regions against xhosa incursions depiction of a zulu attack on a boer camp in february  in the first two decades of the th century the zulu people grew in power and expanded their territory under their leader shaka shakas warfare led indirectly to the mfecane crushing that devastated and depopulated the inland plateau in the early s an offshoot of the zulu the matabele people created a larger empire that included large parts of the highveld under their king mzilikazi during the early s many dutch settlers departed from the cape colony where they had been subjected to british control they migrated to the future natal orange free state and transvaal regions the boers founded the boer republics the south african republic now gauteng limpopo mpumalanga and north west provinces and the orange free state free state the discovery of diamonds in  and gold in  in the interior started the mineral revolution and increased economic growth and immigration this intensified british efforts to gain control over the indigenous peoples the struggle to control these important economic resources was a factor in relations between europeans and the indigenous population and also between the boers and the british the anglozulu war was fought in  between the british empire and the zulu kingdom following lord carnarvons successful introduction of federation in canada it was thought that similar political effort coupled with military campaigns might succeed with the african kingdoms tribal areas and boer republics in south africa in  sir henry bartle frere was sent to south africa as high commissioner for the british empire to bring such plans into being among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the south african republic and the kingdom of zululand and its army the zulu nation spectacularly defeated the british at the battle of isandlwana eventually though the war was lost resulting in the end of the zulu nations independence boers in combat  the boer republics successfully resisted british encroachments during the first boer war – using guerrilla warfare tactics which were well suited to local conditions the british returned with greater numbers more experience and new strategy in the second boer war – but suffered heavy casualties through attrition nonetheless they were ultimately successful independence within the country antibritish policies among white south africans focused on independence during the dutch and british colonial years racial segregation was mostly informal though some legislation was enacted to control the settlement and movement of native people including the native location act of  and the system of pass laws eight years after the end of the second boer war and after four years of negotiation an act of the british parliament south africa act  granted nominal independence while creating the union of south africa on  may  the union was a dominion that included the former territories of the cape and natal colonies as well as the republics of orange

 the national party was elected to power it strengthened the racial segregation begun under dutch and british colonial rule the nationalist government classified all peoples into three races and developed rights and limitations for each the white minority less than  controlled the vastly larger black majority the legally institutionalised segregation became known as apartheid while whites enjoyed the highest standard of living in all of africa comparable to first world western nations the black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard including income education housing and life expectancy the freedom charter adopted in  by the congress alliance demanded a nonracial society and an end to discrimination republic on  may  the country became a republic following a referendum in which white voters narrowly voted in favour thereof the britishdominated natal province rallied against the issue queen elizabeth ii was stripped of the title queen of south africa and the last governorgeneral namely charles robberts swart became state president as a concession to the westminster system the presidency remained parliamentary appointed and virtually powerless until p

commonwealth of nations countries south africa withdrew from the organisation in  and rejoined it only in  despite opposition both within and outside the country the government legislated for a continuation of apartheid the security forces cracked down on internal dissent and violence became widespread with antiapartheid organisations such as the african national congress the azanian peoples organisation and the panafricanist congress carrying out guerrilla warfare and urban sabotage the three rival resistance movements also engaged in occasional interfactional clashes as they jockeyed for domestic influence apartheid became increasingly controversial and several countries began to boycott business with the south african government because of its racial policies these measures were later extended to international sanctions and the divestment of holdings by foreign investors f w de klerk and nelson mandela shake hands in january  in the late s south africa initiated a programme of nuclear weapons development in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons end of apartheid the mahlabatini declaration of faith signed by mangosuthu buthelezi and harry

the ban on the african national congress and other political organisations it released nelson mandela from prison after twentyseven years serving a sentence for sabotage a negotiation process followed with approval from a predominantly white referendum the government repealed apartheid legislation south africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty

escarpment whose eastern and highest stretch is known as the drakensberg the south and southwestern parts of the plateau at approximately – m above sea level and the adjoining plain below at approximately – m above sea level – see map on the right is known as the great karoo which consists of sparsely populated scrubland to the north the great karoo fades into the even drier and more arid bushmanland which eventually becomes the kalahari desert in the very northwest of the country the mideastern and highest part of the plateau is known as the highveld this relatively wellwatered area is home to a great proportion of the country’s commercial farmlands and contains its largest conurbation gauteng province to the north of highveld from about the °  s line of latitude the plateau slopes downwards into the bushveld which ultimately gives way to the limpopo lowlands or lowveld flat topped hills called karoo koppies are highly characteristic of the southern and southwestern karoo landscape these hills are capped by hard erosion resistant dolerite sills this is solidified lava that was forced under high pressure between the horizontal strata of the sedimentary rocks that make up most of the karoo’s geology about  million years ago since then southern africa has undergone a prolonged period of erosion removing the relatively soft karoo rocks except where they are protected by a cap of dolerite this photograph was taken near cradock in the eastern cape the coastal belt below the great escarpment moving clockwise from the northeast consists of the limpopo lowveld which merges into the mpumalanga lowveld below the mpumalanga drakensberg the eastern portion of the great escarpment this is hotter drier and less intensely cultivated than the highveld above the escarpment the kruger national park located in the provinces of limpopo and mpumalanga in northeastern south africa occupies a large portion of the lowveld covering  square kilometres  sq mi  south of the lowveld the annual rainfall increases as one enters kwazulunatal province which especially near the coast is subtropically hot and humid the kwazulunatal – lesotho international border is formed by the highest portion of the great escarpment or drakensberg which reaches an altitude of over  m  ft the climate at the foot of this part of the drakensberg is temperate drakensberg the eastern and highest portion of the great escarpment which surrounds the east south and western borders of the central plateau of southern africa the coastal belt below the south and southwestern stretches of the

article climate of south africa köppen climate types of south africa south africa has a generally temperate climate due in part to being surrounded by the atlantic and indian oceans on three sides by its location in the climatically milder southern hemisphere and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north towards the equator and further inland due to this varied topography and oceanic influence a great variety of climatic zones exist the climatic zones range from the extreme desert of the southern namib in the farthest northwest to the lush subtropical climate in the east along the mozambique border and the indian ocean winters in south africa occur between june and august the extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the mediterranean with wet winters and hot dry summers hosting the famous fynbos biome of shrubland and thicket this area also produces much of the wine in south africa this region is also particularly known for its wind which blows intermittently almost all year the severity of this wind made passing around the cape of good hope particularly treacherous for sailors causing many shipwrecks further east on the south coast rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year producing a green landscape this area is popularly known as the garden route the free state is particularly flat because it lies centrally on

the few in africa never to have had a coup détat and regular elections have been held for almost a century however the vast majority of black south africans were not enfranchised until  during the twentieth century the black majority sought to recover its rights from the dominant white minority with this struggle playing a large role in the countrys recent history and politics the national party imposed the apartheid system in  institutionalising previous racial segregation after a long and sometimes violent struggle by the african national congress and other antiapartheid activists

africa contains some of the oldest archaeological and human fossil sites in the world extensive fossil remains have been recovered from a series of caves in gauteng province the area is a unesco world heritage site and has been termed the cradle of humankind the sites include sterkfontein which is one of the richest hominin fossil sites in the world other sites include swartkrans gondolin cave kromdraai coopers cave and malapa the first hominin fossil discovered in africa the taung child was found near taung in  further hominin remains have been recovered from the sites of makapansgat in limpopo cornelia and florisbad in the free state border cave in kwazulunatal klasies river mouth in eastern cape and pinnacle point elandsfontein and die kelders cave in western cape these sites suggest that various hominid species existed in south africa from about three million years ago starting with australopithecus africanus these were succeeded by various species including australopithecus sediba homo ergaster homo erectus homo rhodesiensis homo helmei homo naledi and modern humans homo sapiens modern humans have inhabited southern africa for at least  years within the vaal river valley pebble tools have been located bantu expansion mapungubwe hill the site of the former capital of the kingdom of mapungubwe settlements of bantuspeaking peoples who were ironusing agriculturists and herdsmen were already present south of the limpopo river now the northern border with botswana and zimbabwe by the th or th century ce see bantu expansion they displaced conquered and absorbed the original khoisan speakers the khoikhoi and san peoples the bantu slowly moved south the earliest ironworks in modernday kwazulunatal province are believed to date from around  the southernmost group was the xhosa people whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier khoisan people the xhosa reached the great fish river in todays eastern cape province as they migrated these larger iron age populations displaced or assimilated earlier peoples in mpumalanga several stone circles have been found along with the stone arrangement that has been named adams calendar portuguese contacts at the time of european contact the dominant ethnic group were bantuspeaking peoples who had migrated from other parts of africa about one thousand years before the two major historic groups were the xhosa and zulu peoples in  the portuguese explorer bartolomeu dias led the first european voyage to land in southern africa on  december he landed at walfisch bay now known as walvis bay in presentday namibia this was south of the furthest point reached in  by his predecessor the portuguese navigator diogo cão cape cross north of the bay dias continued down the western coast of southern africa after  january  prevented by storms from proceeding along the coast he sailed out of sight of land and passed the southernmost point of africa without seeing it he reached as far up the eastern coast of africa as what he called rio do infante probably the presentday groot river in may  but on his return he saw the cape which he first named cabo das tormentas cape of storms his king john ii renamed the point cabo da boa esperança or cape of good hope as it led to the riches of the east indies dias feat of navigation was later immortalised in luís de camões portuguese epic poem the lusiads  dutch colonisation see also history of cape colony and dutch cape colony charles davidson bells thcentury painting of jan van riebeeck who founded the first european settlement in south africa arrives in table bay in  by the early th century portugals maritime power was starting to decline and english and dutch merchants competed to oust lisbon from its lucrative monopoly on the spice trade representatives of the british east india company did call sporadically at the cape in search of provisions as early as  but later came to favour ascension island and st helena as alternative ports of refuge dutch interest was aroused after  when two employees of the dutch east india company voc were shipwrecked there for several months the sailors were able to survive by obtaining fresh water and meat from the natives they also sowed vegetables in the fertile soil upon their return to holland they reported favourably on the capes potential as a warehouse and garden for provisions to stock passing ships for long voyages in  a century and a half after the discovery of the cape sea route jan van riebeeck established a victualing station at the cape of good hope at what would become cape town on behalf of the dutch east india company in time the cape become home to a large population of vrijlieden also known as vrijburgers free citizens former company employees who stayed in dutch territories overseas after serving their contracts dutch traders also imported thousands of slaves to the fledgling colony from indonesia madagascar and parts of eastern africa some of the earliest mixed race communities in the country were later formed through unions between vrijburgers their slaves and various indigenous peoples this led to the development of a new ethnic group the cape coloureds most of whom adopted the dutch language and christian faith the eastward expansion of dutch colonists ushered in a series of wars with the southwesterly migrating xhosa tribe as both sides competed for the pastureland necessary to graze their cattle near the great fish river vrijburgers who became independent farmers on the frontier were known as boers with some adopting seminomadic lifestyles being denoted as trekboers the boers formed loose militias which they termed commandos and forged alliances with khoisan groups to repel xhosa raids both sides launched bloody but inconclusive offensives and sporadic violence often accompanied by livestock theft remained common for several decades british colonisation great britain occupied cape town between  and  to prevent it from falling under the control of the french first republic which had invaded the low countries despite briefly returning to dutch rule under the batavian republic in  the cape was occupied again by the british in  following the end of the napoleonic wars it was formally ceded to great britain and became an integral part of the british empire british immigration to south africa began around  subsequently culminating in the arrival of the  settlers the new colonists were induced to settle for a variety of reasons namely to increase the size of the european workforce and to bolster frontier regions against xhosa incursions depiction of a zulu attack on a boer camp in february  in the first two decades of the th century the zulu people grew in power and expanded their territory under their leader shaka shakas warfare led indirectly to the mfecane crushing that devastated and depopulated the inland plateau in the early s an offshoot of the zulu the matabele people created a larger empire that included large parts of the highveld under their king mzilikazi during the early s many dutch settlers departed from the cape colony where they had been subjected to british control they migrated to the future natal orange free state and transvaal regions the boers founded the boer republics the south african republic now gauteng limpopo mpumalanga and north west provinces and the orange free state free state the discovery of diamonds in  and gold in  in the interior started the mineral revolution and increased economic growth and immigration this intensified british efforts to gain control over the indigenous peoples the struggle to control these important economic resources was a factor in relations between europeans and the indigenous population and also between the boers and the british the anglozulu war was fought in  between the british empire and the zulu kingdom following lord carnarvons successful introduction of federation in canada it was thought that similar political effort coupled with military campaigns might succeed with the african kingdoms tribal areas and boer republics in south africa in  sir henry bartle frere was sent to south africa as high commissioner for the british empire to bring such plans into being among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the south african republic and the kingdom of zululand and its army the zulu nation spectacularly defeated the british at the battle of isandlwana eventually though the war was lost resulting in the end of the zulu nations independence boers in combat  the boer republics successfully resisted british encroachments during the first boer war – using guerrilla warfare tactics which were well suited to local conditions the british returned with greater numbers more experience and new strategy in the second boer war – but suffered heavy casualties through attrition nonetheless they were ultimately successful independence within the country antibritish policies among white south africans focused on independence during the dutch and british colonial years racial segregation was mostly informal though some legislation was enacted to control the settlement and movement of native people including the native location act of  and the system of pass laws eight years after the end of the second boer war and after four years of negotiation an act of the british parliament south africa act  granted nominal independence while creating the union of south africa on  may  the union was a dominion that included the former territories of the cape and natal colonies as well as the republics of orange free state and transvaal the natives land act of  severely restricted the ownership of land by blacks at that stage natives controlled only  of the country the amount of land reserved for indigenous peoples was later marginally increased in  the union was fully sovereign from the united kingdom with the passage of the statute of westminster which abolished the last powers of the british government on the country in  the south african party and national party merged to form the united party seeking reconciliation between afrikaners and englishspeaking whites in  the party split over the entry of the union into world war ii as an ally of the united kingdom a move which the national party followers strongly opposed beginning of apartheid for use by white persons – apartheid sign in  the national party was elected to power it strengthened the racial segregation begun under dutch and british colonial rule the nationalist government classified all peoples into three races and developed rights and limitations for each the white minority less than  controlled the vastly larger black majority the legally institutionalised segregation became known as apartheid while whites enjoyed the highest standard of living in all of africa comparable to first world western nations the black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard including income education housing and life expectancy the freedom charter adopted in  by the congress alliance demanded a nonracial society and an end to discrimination republic on  may  the country became a republic following a referendum in which white voters narrowly voted in favour thereof the britishdominated natal province rallied against the issue queen elizabeth ii was stripped of the title queen of south africa and the last governorgeneral namely charles robberts swart became state president as a concession to the westminster system the presidency remained parliamentary appointed and virtually powerless until p w bothas constitution act of  which intact in these regards eliminated the office of prime minister and instated a nearunique strong presidency responsible to parliament pressured by other commonwealth of nations countries south africa withdrew from the organisation in  and rejoined it only in  despite opposition both within and outside the country the government legislated for a continuation of apartheid the security forces cracked down on internal dissent and violence became widespread with antiapartheid organisations such as the african national congress the azanian peoples organisation and the panafricanist congress carrying out guerrilla warfare and urban sabotage the three rival resistance movements also engaged in occasional interfactional clashes as they jockeyed for domestic influence apartheid became increasingly controversial and several countries began to boycott business with the south african government because of its racial policies these measures were later extended to international sanctions and the divestment of holdings by foreign investors f w de klerk and nelson mandela shake hands in january  in the late s south africa initiated a programme of nuclear weapons development in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons end of apartheid the mahlabatini declaration of faith signed by mangosuthu buthelezi and harry schwarz in  enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all the first of such agreements by black and white political leaders in south africa ultimately f w de klerk opened bilateral discussions with nelson mandela in  for a transition of policies and government in  the national party government took the first step towards dismantling discrimination when it lifted the ban on the african national congress and other political organisations it released nelson mandela from prison after twentyseven years serving a sentence for sabotage a negotiation process followed with approval from a predominantly white referendum the government repealed apartheid legislation south africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty south africa held its first universal elections in  which the anc won by an overwhelming majority it has been in power ever since the country rejoined the commonwealth of nations and became a member of the southern african development community sadc nelson mandela first black african president of republic of south africa in postapartheid south africa unemployment has been extremely high as the country has struggled with many changes while many blacks have risen to middle or upper classes the overall unemployment rate of blacks worsened between  and  poverty among whites previously rare increased in addition the current government has struggled to achieve the monetary and fiscal discipline to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth since the ancled government took power the united nations human development index of south africa has fallen while it was steadily rising until the mids some may be attributed to the hivaids pandemic and the failure of the government to take steps to address it in the early years in may  riots left over sixty people dead the centre on housing rights and evictions estimates over  people were driven from their homes the targets were mainly migrants and refugees seeking asylum but a third of the victims were south african citizens in a  survey the south african migration project concluded that south africans are more opposed to immigration than anywhere else in the world the united nations high commissioner for refugees in  reported over  refugees applied for asylum in south africa almost four times as many as the year before these people were mainly from zimbabwe though many also come from burundi democratic republic of the congo rwanda eritrea ethiopia and somalia competition over jobs business opportunities public services and housing has led to tension between refugees and host communities while xenophobia is still a problem recent violence has not been as widespread as initially feared geography main article geography of south africa a map of south africa showing the main topographic features the central plateau edged by the great escarpment and the cape fold belt in the southwest corner of the country important geographical regions in south africa the thick line traces the course of the great escarpment which edges the central plateau the eastern portion of this line coloured red is known as the drakensberg the escarpment rises to its highest point at over  m where the drakensberg forms the border between kwazulunatal and lesotho none of the regions indicated on the map has a sharp welldefined border except where the escarpment or a range of mountains forms a clear dividing line between two regions some of the better known regions are coloured in the others are simply indicated by their names as they would be in an atlas south africa is located at the southernmost region of africa with a long coastline that stretches more than  km  mi and along two oceans the south atlantic and the indian at  km  sq mi south africa is the thlargest country in the world and is comparable in size to colombia mafadi in the drakensberg at  m  ft is the highest peak in south africa excluding the prince edward islands the country lies between latitudes ° and °s and longitudes ° and °e the interior of south africa consists of a vast in most places almost flat plateau with an altitude of between  m  ft and  m  ft highest in the east and sloping gently downwards towards the west and north and slightly less noticeably so to the south and southwest this plateau is surrounded by the great escarpment whose eastern and highest stretch is known as the drakensberg the south and southwestern parts of the plateau at approximately – m above sea level and the adjoining plain below at approximately – m above sea level – see map on the right is known as the great karoo which consists of sparsely populated scrubland to the north the great karoo fades into the even drier and more arid bushmanland which eventually becomes the kalahari desert in the very northwest of the country the mideastern and highest part of the plateau is known as the highveld this relatively wellwatered area is home to a great proportion of the country’s commercial farmlands and contains its largest conurbation gauteng province to the north of highveld from about the °  s line of latitude the plateau slopes downwards into the bushveld which ultimately gives way to the limpopo lowlands or lowveld flat topped hills called karoo koppies are highly characteristic of the southern and southwestern karoo landscape these hills are capped by hard erosion resistant dolerite sills this is solidified lava that was forced under high pressure between the horizontal strata of the sedimentary rocks that make up most of the karoo’s geology about  million years ago since then southern africa has undergone a prolonged period of erosion removing the relatively soft karoo rocks except where they are protected by a cap of dolerite this photograph was taken near cradock in the eastern cape the coastal belt below the great escarpment moving clockwise from the northeast consists of the limpopo lowveld which merges into the mpumalanga lowveld below the mpumalanga drakensberg the eastern portion of the great escarpment this is hotter drier and less intensely cultivated than the highveld above the escarpment the kruger national park located in the provinces of limpopo and mpumalanga in northeastern south africa occupies a large portion of the lowveld covering  square kilometres  sq mi  south of the lowveld the annual rainfall increases as one enters kwazulunatal province which especially near the coast is subtropically hot and humid the kwazulunatal – lesotho international border is formed by the highest portion of the great escarpment or drakensberg which reaches an altitude of over  m  ft the climate at the foot of this part of the drakensberg is temperate drakensberg the eastern and highest portion of the great escarpment which surrounds the east south and western borders of the central plateau of southern africa the coastal belt below the south and southwestern stretches of the great escarpment contains several ranges of cape fold mountains which run parallel to the coast separating the great escarpment from the ocean these parallel ranges of fold mountains are shown on the map above left note the course of the great escarpment to the north of these mountain ranges the land at approximately – m above sea level between two of these ranges of fold mountains in the south ie between the outeniqua and langeberg ranges to the south and the swartberg range to the north is known as the little karoo which consists of semidesert scrubland similar to that of the great karoo except that its northern strip along the foothills of the swartberg mountains has a somewhat higher rainfall and is therefore more cultivated than the great karoo the little karoo is historically and still famous for its ostrich farming around the town of oudtshoorn the lowland area – m above sea level to the north of the swartberg mountain range up to the great escarpment is the lowland part of the great karoo see map at top right which is climatically and botanically almost indistinguishable from the karoo above the great escarpment the narrow coastal strip between the most seaward cape fold mountain range ie the langeberg–outeniqua mountains and the ocean has a moderately high yearround rainfall especially in the georgeknysnaplettenberg bay region which is known as the garden route it is famous for the most extensive areas of indigenous forests in south africa a generally forestpoor country in the southwest corner of the country the cape peninsula forms the southernmost tip of the coastal strip which borders the atlantic ocean and ultimately terminates at the country’s border with namibia at the orange river the cape peninsula has a mediterranean climate making it and its immediate surrounds the only portion of africa south of the sahara which receives most of its rainfall in winter the greater cape town metropolitan area is situated on the cape peninsula and is home to  million people according to the  population census it is the countrys legislative capital spring flowers in namaqualand the coastal belt to the north of the cape peninsula is bounded on the west by the atlantic ocean and the first row of northsouth running cape fold mountains to the east the cape fold mountains peter out at about the ° s line of latitude after which the coastal plain is bounded by the great escarpment itself the most southerly portion of this coastal belt is known as the swartland and malmesbury plain which is an important wheat growing region relying on winter rains the region further north is known as namaqualand which becomes more and more arid as one approaches the orange river the little rain that falls tends to fall in winter which results in one of the world’s most spectacular displays of flowers carpeting huge stretches of veld in spring august–september cape floral region protected areas south africa also has one possession the small subantarctic archipelago of the prince edward islands consisting of marion island  km or  sq mi and prince edward island  km or  sq mi not to be confused with the canadian province of the same name climate main article climate of south africa köppen climate types of south africa south africa has a generally temperate climate due in part to being surrounded by the atlantic and indian oceans on three sides by its location in the climatically milder southern hemisphere and due to the

consists of africas largest communities of european white asian indian and multiracial coloured ancestry south africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures languages and religions its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitutions recognition of eleven official languages which is among the highest number of any country in the world two of these languages are of european origin afrikaans developed from dutch and serves as the first language of most white and coloured south africans english reflects the legacy of british colonialism and is commonly used in public and commercial life though it is fourthranked as a spoken first language the country is one of the few in africa never to have had a coup détat and regular elections have been held for almost a century however the vast majority of black south africans were not enfranchised until  during the twentieth century the black majority sought to recover its rights from the dominant white minority with this struggle playing a large role in the countrys recent history and politics the national party imposed the apartheid system in  institutionalising previous racial segregation after a long and sometimes violent struggle by the african national congress and other antiapartheid activists both inside and outside the country discriminatory laws began to be repealed or abolished from  onwards

the world extensive fossil remains have been recovered from a series of caves in gauteng province the area is a unesco world heritage site and has been termed the cradle of humankind the sites include sterkfontein which is one of the richest hominin fossil sites in the world other sites include swartkrans gondolin cave kromdraai coopers cave and malapa the first hominin fossil discovered in africa the taung child was found near taung in  further hominin remains have been recovered from the sites of makapansgat in limpopo cornelia and florisbad in the free state border cave in kwazulunatal klasies river mouth in eastern cape and pinnacle point elandsfontein and die kelders cave in western cape these sites suggest that various hominid species existed in south africa from about three million years ago starting with australopithecus africanus these were succeeded by various species including australopithecus sediba homo ergaster homo erectus homo rhodesiensis homo helmei homo naledi and modern humans homo sapiens modern humans have inhabited southern africa for at least  years within the vaal river valley pebble tools have been located bantu expansion mapungubwe hill the site of the former capital of the kingdom of mapungubwe settlements of bantuspeaking peoples who were ironusing agriculturists and herdsmen were already present south of the limpopo river now the northern border with botswana and zimbabwe by the th or th century ce see bantu expansion they displaced conquered and absorbed the original khoisan speakers the khoikhoi and san peoples the bantu slowly moved south the earliest ironworks in modernday kwazulunatal province are believed to date from around  the southernmost group was the xhosa people whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier khoisan people the xhosa reached the great fish river in todays eastern cape province as they migrated these larger iron age populations displaced or assimilated earlier peoples in mpumalanga several stone circles have been found along with the stone arrangement that has been named adams calendar portuguese contacts at the time of european contact the dominant ethnic group were bantuspeaking peoples who had migrated from other parts of africa about one thousand years before the two major historic groups were the xhosa and zulu peoples in  the portuguese explorer bartolomeu dias led the first european voyage to land in southern africa on  december he landed at walfisch bay now known as walvis bay in presentday namibia this was south of the furthest point reached in  by his predecessor the portuguese navigator diogo cão cape cross north of the bay dias continued down the western coast of southern africa after  january  prevented by storms from proceeding along the coast he sailed out of sight of land and passed the southernmost point of africa without seeing it he reached as far up the eastern coast of africa as what he called rio do infante probably the presentday groot river in may  but on his return he saw the cape which he first named cabo das tormentas cape of storms his king john ii renamed the point cabo da boa esperança or cape of good hope as it led to the riches of the east indies dias feat of navigation was later immortalised in luís de camões portuguese epic poem the lusiads  dutch colonisation see also history of cape colony and dutch cape colony charles davidson bells thcentury painting of jan van riebeeck who founded the first european settlement in south africa arrives in table bay in  by the early th century portugals maritime power was starting to decline and english and dutch merchants competed to oust lisbon from its lucrative monopoly on the spice trade representatives of the british east india company did call sporadically at the cape in search of provisions as early as  but later came to favour ascension island and st helena as alternative ports of refuge dutch interest was aroused after  when two employees of the dutch east india company voc were shipwrecked there for several months the sailors were able to survive by obtaining fresh water and meat from the natives they also sowed vegetables in the fertile soil upon their return to holland they reported favourably on the capes potential as a warehouse and garden for provisions to stock passing ships for long voyages in  a century and a half after the discovery of the cape sea route jan van riebeeck established a victualing station at the cape of good hope at what would become cape town on behalf of the dutch east india company in time the cape become home to a large population of vrijlieden also known as vrijburgers free citizens former company employees who stayed in dutch territories overseas after serving their contracts dutch traders also imported thousands of slaves to the fledgling colony from indonesia madagascar and parts of eastern africa some of the earliest mixed race communities in the country were later formed through unions between vrijburgers their slaves and various indigenous peoples this led to the development of a new ethnic group the cape coloureds most of whom adopted the dutch language and christian faith the eastward expansion of dutch colonists ushered in a series of wars with the southwesterly migrating xhosa tribe as both sides competed for the pastureland necessary to graze their cattle near the great fish river vrijburgers who became independent farmers on the frontier were known as boers with some adopting seminomadic lifestyles being denoted as trekboers the boers formed loose militias which they termed commandos and forged alliances with khoisan groups to repel xhosa raids both sides launched bloody but inconclusive offensives and sporadic violence often accompanied by livestock theft remained common for several decades british colonisation great britain occupied cape town between  and  to prevent it from falling under the control of the french first republic which had invaded the low countries despite briefly returning to dutch rule under the batavian republic in  the cape was occupied again by the british in  following the end of the napoleonic wars it was formally ceded to great britain and became an integral part of the british empire british immigration to south africa began around  subsequently culminating in the arrival of the  settlers the new colonists were induced to settle for a variety of reasons namely to increase the size of the european workforce and to bolster frontier regions against xhosa incursions depiction of a zulu attack on a boer camp in february  in the first two decades of the th century the zulu people grew in power and expanded their territory under their leader shaka shakas warfare led indirectly to the mfecane crushing that devastated and depopulated the inland plateau in the early s an offshoot of the zulu the matabele people created a larger empire that included large parts of the highveld under their king mzilikazi during the early s many dutch settlers departed from the cape colony where they had been subjected to british control they migrated to the future natal orange free state and transvaal regions the boers founded the boer republics the south african republic now gauteng limpopo mpumalanga and north west provinces and the orange free state free state the discovery of diamonds in  and gold in  in the interior started the mineral revolution and increased economic growth and immigration this intensified british efforts to gain control over the indigenous peoples the struggle to control these important economic resources was a factor in relations between europeans and the indigenous population and also between the boers and the british the anglozulu war was fought in  between the british empire and the zulu kingdom following lord carnarvons successful introduction of federation in canada it was thought that similar political effort coupled with military campaigns might succeed with the african kingdoms tribal areas and boer republics in south africa in  sir henry bartle frere was sent to south africa as high commissioner for the british empire to bring such plans into being among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the south african republic and the kingdom of zululand and its army the zulu nation spectacularly defeated the british at the battle of isandlwana eventually though the war was lost resulting in the end of the zulu nations independence boers in combat  the boer republics successfully resisted british encroachments during the first boer war – using guerrilla warfare tactics which were well suited to local conditions the british returned with greater numbers more experience and new strategy in the second boer war – but suffered heavy casualties through attrition nonetheless they were ultimately successful independence within the country antibritish policies among white south africans focused on independence during the dutch and british colonial years racial segregation was mostly informal though some legislation was enacted to control the settlement and movement of native people including the native location act of  and the system of pass laws eight years after the end of the second boer war and after four years of negotiation an act of the british parliament south africa act  granted nominal independence while creating the union of south africa on  may  the union was a dominion that included the former territories of the cape and natal colonies as well as the republics of orange free state and transvaal the natives land act of  severely restricted the ownership of land by blacks at that stage natives controlled only  of the country the amount of land reserved for indigenous peoples was later marginally increased in  the union was fully sovereign from the united kingdom with the passage of the statute of westminster which abolished the last powers of the british government on the country in  the south african party and national party merged to form the united party seeking reconciliation between afrikaners and englishspeaking whites in  the party split over the entry of the union into world war ii as an ally of the united kingdom a move which the national party followers strongly opposed beginning of apartheid for use by white persons – apartheid sign in  the national party was elected to power it strengthened the racial segregation begun under dutch and british colonial rule the nationalist government classified all peoples into three races and developed rights and limitations for each the white minority less than  controlled the vastly larger black majority the legally institutionalised segregation became known as apartheid while whites enjoyed the highest standard of living in all of africa comparable to first world western nations the black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard including income education housing and life expectancy the freedom charter adopted in  by the congress alliance demanded a nonracial society and an end to discrimination republic on  may  the country became a republic following a referendum in which white voters narrowly voted in favour thereof the britishdominated natal province rallied against the issue queen elizabeth ii was stripped of the title queen of south africa and the last governorgeneral namely charles robberts swart became state president as a concession to the westminster system the presidency remained parliamentary appointed and virtually powerless until p w bothas constitution act of  which intact in these regards eliminated the office of prime minister and instated a nearunique strong presidency responsible to parliament pressured by other commonwealth of nations countries south africa withdrew from the organisation in  and rejoined it only in  despite opposition both within and outside the country the government legislated for a continuation of apartheid the security forces cracked down on internal dissent and violence became widespread with antiapartheid organisations such as the african national congress the azanian peoples organisation and the panafricanist congress carrying out guerrilla warfare and urban sabotage the three rival resistance movements also engaged in occasional interfactional clashes as they jockeyed for domestic influence apartheid became increasingly controversial and several countries began to boycott business with the south african government because of its racial policies these measures were later extended to international sanctions and the divestment of holdings by foreign investors f w de klerk and nelson mandela shake hands in january  in the late s south africa initiated a programme of nuclear weapons development in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons end of apartheid the mahlabatini declaration of faith signed by mangosuthu buthelezi and harry schwarz in  enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all the first of such agreements by black and white political leaders in south africa ultimately f w de klerk opened bilateral discussions with nelson mandela in  for a transition of policies and government in  the national party government took the first step towards dismantling discrimination when it lifted the ban on the african national congress and other political organisations it released nelson mandela from prison after twentyseven years serving a sentence for sabotage a negotiation process followed with approval from a predominantly white referendum the government repealed apartheid legislation south africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty south africa held its first universal elections in  which the anc won by an overwhelming majority it has been in power ever since the country rejoined the commonwealth of nations and became a member of the southern african development community sadc nelson mandela first black african president of republic of south africa in postapartheid south africa unemployment has been extremely high as the country has struggled with many changes while many blacks have risen to middle or upper classes the overall unemployment rate of blacks worsened between  and  poverty among whites previously rare increased in addition the current government has struggled to achieve the monetary and fiscal discipline to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth since the ancled government took power the united nations human development index of south africa has fallen while it was steadily rising until the mids some may be attributed to the hivaids pandemic and the failure of the government to take steps to address it in the early years in may  riots left over sixty people dead the centre on housing rights and evictions estimates over  people were driven from their homes the targets were mainly migrants and refugees seeking asylum but a third of the victims were south african citizens in a  survey the south african migration project concluded that south africans are more opposed to immigration than anywhere else in the world the united nations high commissioner for refugees in  reported over  refugees applied for asylum in south africa almost four times as many as the year before these people were mainly from zimbabwe though many also come from burundi democratic republic of the congo rwanda eritrea ethiopia and somalia competition over jobs business opportunities public services and housing has led to tension between refugees and host communities while xenophobia is still a problem recent violence has not been as widespread as initially feared geography main article geography of south africa a map of south africa showing the main topographic features the central plateau edged by the great escarpment and the cape fold belt in the southwest corner of the country important geographical regions in south africa the thick line traces the course of the great escarpment which edges the central plateau the eastern portion of this line coloured red is known as the drakensberg the escarpment rises to its highest point at over  m where the drakensberg forms the border between kwazulunatal and lesotho none of the regions indicated on the map has a sharp welldefined border except where the escarpment or a range of mountains forms a clear dividing line between two regions some of the better known regions are coloured in the others are simply indicated by their names as they would be in an atlas south africa is located at the southernmost region of africa with a long coastline that stretches more than  km  mi and along two oceans the south atlantic and the indian at  km  sq mi south africa is the thlargest country in the world and is comparable in size to colombia mafadi in the drakensberg at  m  ft is the highest peak in south africa excluding the prince edward islands the country lies between latitudes ° and °s and longitudes ° and °e the interior of south africa consists of a vast in most places almost flat plateau with an altitude of between  m  ft and  m  ft highest in the east and sloping gently downwards towards the west and north and slightly less noticeably so to the south and southwest this plateau is surrounded by the great escarpment whose eastern and highest stretch is known as the drakensberg the south and southwestern parts of the plateau at approximately – m above sea level and the adjoining plain below at approximately – m above sea level – see map on the right is known as the great karoo which consists of sparsely populated scrubland to the north the great karoo fades into the even drier and more arid bushmanland which eventually becomes the kalahari desert in the very northwest of the country the mideastern and highest part of the plateau is known as the highveld this relatively wellwatered area is home to a great proportion of the country’s commercial farmlands and contains its largest conurbation gauteng province to the north of highveld from about the °  s line of latitude the plateau slopes downwards into the bushveld which ultimately gives way to the limpopo lowlands or lowveld flat topped hills called karoo koppies are highly characteristic of the southern and southwestern karoo landscape these hills are capped by hard erosion resistant dolerite sills this is solidified lava that was forced under high pressure between the horizontal strata of the sedimentary rocks that make up most of the karoo’s geology about  million years ago since then southern africa has undergone a prolonged period of erosion removing the relatively soft karoo rocks except where they are protected by a cap of dolerite this photograph was taken near cradock in the eastern cape the coastal belt below the great escarpment moving clockwise from the northeast consists of the limpopo lowveld which merges into the mpumalanga lowveld below the mpumalanga drakensberg the eastern portion of the great escarpment this is hotter drier and less intensely cultivated than the highveld above the escarpment the kruger national park located in the provinces of limpopo and mpumalanga in northeastern south africa occupies a large portion of the lowveld covering  square kilometres  sq mi  south of the lowveld the annual rainfall increases as one enters kwazulunatal province which especially near the coast is subtropically hot and humid the kwazulunatal – lesotho international border is formed by the highest portion of the great escarpment or drakensberg which reaches an altitude of over  m  ft the climate at the foot of this part of the drakensberg is temperate drakensberg the eastern and highest portion of the great escarpment which surrounds the east south and western borders of the central plateau of southern africa the coastal belt below the south and southwestern stretches of the great escarpment contains several ranges of cape fold mountains which run parallel to the coast separating the great escarpment from the ocean these parallel ranges of fold mountains are shown on the map above left note the course of the great escarpment to the north of these mountain ranges the land at approximately – m above sea level between two of these ranges of fold mountains in the south ie between the outeniqua and langeberg ranges to the south and the swartberg range to the north is known as the little karoo which consists of semidesert scrubland similar to that of the great karoo except that its northern strip along the foothills of the swartberg mountains has a somewhat higher rainfall and is therefore more cultivated than the great karoo the little karoo is historically and still famous for its ostrich farming around the town of oudtshoorn the lowland area – m above sea level to the north of the swartberg mountain range up to the great escarpment is the lowland part of the great karoo see map at top right which is climatically and botanically almost indistinguishable from the karoo above the great escarpment the narrow coastal strip between the most seaward cape fold mountain range ie the langeberg–outeniqua mountains and the ocean has a moderately high yearround rainfall especially in the georgeknysnaplettenberg bay region which is known as the garden route it is famous for the most extensive areas of indigenous forests in south africa a generally forestpoor country in the southwest corner of the country the cape peninsula forms the southernmost tip of the coastal strip which borders the atlantic ocean and ultimately terminates at the country’s border with namibia at the orange river the cape peninsula has a mediterranean climate making it and its immediate surrounds the only portion of africa south of the sahara which receives most of its rainfall in winter the greater cape town metropolitan area is situated on the cape peninsula and is home to  million people according to the  population census it is the countrys legislative capital spring flowers in namaqualand the coastal belt to the north of the cape peninsula is bounded on the west by the atlantic ocean and the first row of northsouth running cape fold mountains to the east the cape fold mountains peter out at about the ° s line of latitude after which the coastal plain is bounded by the great escarpment itself the most southerly portion of this coastal belt is known as the swartland and malmesbury plain which is an important wheat growing region relying on winter rains the region further north is known as namaqualand which becomes more and more arid as one approaches the orange river the little rain that falls tends to fall in winter which results in one of the world’s most spectacular displays of flowers carpeting huge stretches of veld in spring august–september cape floral region protected areas south africa also has one possession the small subantarctic archipelago of the prince edward islands consisting of marion island  km or  sq mi and prince edward island  km or  sq mi not to be confused with the canadian province of the same name climate main article climate of south africa köppen climate types of south africa south africa has a generally temperate climate due in part to being surrounded by the atlantic and indian oceans on three sides by its location in the climatically milder southern hemisphere and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north towards the equator and further inland due to this varied topography and oceanic influence a great variety of climatic zones exist the climatic zones range from the extreme desert of the southern namib in the farthest northwest to the lush subtropical climate in the east along the mozambique border and the indian ocean winters in south africa occur between june and august the extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the mediterranean with wet winters and hot dry summers hosting the famous fynbos biome of shrubland and thicket this area also produces much of the wine in south africa this region is also particularly known for its wind which blows intermittently almost all year the severity of this wind made passing around the cape of good hope particularly treacherous for sailors causing many shipwrecks further east on the south coast rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year producing a green landscape this area is popularly known as the garden route the free state is particularly flat because it lies centrally on the high plateau north of the vaal river the highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat johannesburg in the centre of the highveld is at  m  ft and receives an annual rainfall of  mm  in winters in this region are cold although snow is rare the high drakensberg mountains which form the southeastern escarpment of the highveld offer limited skiing opportunities in winter the coldest place on mainland south africa is sutherland in the western roggeveld mountains where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as − °c  °f the prince edward islands have colder average annual temperatures but sutherland has colder extremes the deep interior of mainland south africa has the hottest temperatures a temperature of  °c  °f was recorded in  in the northern cape kalahari near upington but this temperature is unofficial and was not recorded with standard equipment the official highest temperature is  °c  °f at vioolsdrif in january  biodiversity

animals south african giraffe kruger national park numerous mammals are found in the bushveld including transvaal lions african leopards south african cheetahs southern white rhinos blue wildebeest kudus impalas hyenas hippopotamuses and south african giraffes a significant extent of the bushveld exists in the northeast including kruger national park and the sabi sand game reserve as well as in the far north in the waterberg biosphere south africa houses many endemic species among them the critically endangered riverine rabbit bunolagus monticullaris in the karoo fungi up to  more than  species of fungi including lichenforming species had been recorded in  the total number of fungi which occur in south africa was conservatively estimated at about  species but that did not take into account fungi associated with insects if correct then the number of south african fungi dwarfs that of its plants in at least some major south african ecosystems an exceptionally high percentage of fungi are highly specific in terms of the plants with which they occur the countrys biodiversity strategy and action plan does not mention fungi including lichenforming fungi plants subtropical forest near durban lowveld vegetation of the kruger national park with more than  different higher plants or about  of all the known species of plants on earth south africa is particularly rich in plant diversity the most prevalent biome in south africa is the grassland particularly on the highveld where the plant cover is dominated by different grasses low shrubs and acacia trees mainly camelthorn

the world extensive fossil remains have been recovered from a series of caves in gauteng province the area is a unesco world heritage site and has been termed the cradle of humankind the sites include sterkfontein which is one of the richest hominin fossil sites in the world other sites include swartkrans gondolin cave kromdraai coopers cave and malapa the first hominin fossil discovered in africa the taung child was found near taung in  further hominin remains have been recovered from the sites of makapansgat in limpopo cornelia and florisbad in the free state border cave in kwazulunatal klasies river mouth in eastern cape and pinnacle point elandsfontein and die kelders cave in western cape these sites suggest that various hominid species existed in south africa from about three million years ago starting with australopithecus africanus these were succeeded by various species including australopithecus sediba homo ergaster homo erectus homo rhodesiensis homo helmei homo

cape colony and dutch cape colony charles davidson bells thcentury painting of jan van riebeeck who founded the first european settlement in south africa arrives in table bay in  by the early th century portugals maritime power was starting to decline and english and dutch merchants competed to oust lisbon from its lucrative monopoly on the spice trade representatives of the british east india company did call sporadically at the cape in search of provisions as early as  but later came to favour ascension island and st helena as alternative ports of refuge dutch interest was aroused after  when two employees of the dutch east india company voc were shipwrecked there for several months the sailors were able to survive by obtaining fresh water and meat from the natives they also sowed vegetables in the fertile soil upon their return to holland they reported favourably on the capes potential as a warehouse and garden for provisions to stock passing ships for long voyages in  a century and a half after the discovery of the cape sea route jan van riebeeck established a victualing station at the cape of good hope at what would become cape town on behalf of the dutch east india company in time the cape become home to a large population of vrijlieden also known as vrijburgers free citizens former company employees who stayed in dutch territories overseas after serving their contracts dutch traders also imported thousands of slaves to the fledgling colony from indonesia madagascar and parts of eastern africa some of the earliest mixed race communities in the country were later formed through unions between vrijburgers their slaves and various indigenous peoples this led to the development of a new ethnic group the cape coloureds most of whom adopted the dutch language and christian faith the eastward expansion of dutch colonists ushered in a series of wars with the southwesterly migrating xhosa tribe as both sides competed for the pastureland necessary to graze their cattle near the great fish river vrijburgers who became independent farmers on the frontier were known as boers with some adopting seminomadic lifestyles being denoted as trekboers the boers formed loose militias which they termed commandos and forged alliances with khoisan groups to repel xhosa raids both sides launched bloody but inconclusive offensives and sporadic violence often accompanied by livestock theft remained common for several decades british colonisation great britain occupied cape town between  and  to prevent it from falling under the control of the french first republic which had invaded the low countries despite briefly returning to dutch rule under the batavian republic in  the cape was occupied again by the british in  following the end of the napoleonic wars it was formally ceded to great britain and became an integral part of the british empire british immigration to south africa began around  subsequently culminating in the arrival of the  settlers the new colonists were induced to settle for a variety of reasons namely to increase the size of the european workforce and to bolster frontier regions against xhosa incursions depiction of a zulu attack on a boer camp in february  in the first two decades of the th century the zulu people grew in power and expanded their territory under their leader shaka shakas warfare led indirectly to the mfecane crushing that devastated and depopulated the inland plateau in the early s an offshoot of the zulu the matabele people created a larger empire that included large parts of the highveld under their king mzilikazi during the early s many dutch settlers departed from the cape colony where they had been subjected to british control they migrated to the future natal orange free state and transvaal regions the boers founded the boer republics the south african republic now gauteng limpopo mpumalanga and north west provinces and the orange free state free state the discovery of diamonds in  and gold in  in the interior started the mineral revolution and increased economic growth and immigration this intensified british efforts to gain control over the indigenous peoples the struggle to control these important economic resources was a factor in relations between europeans and the indigenous population and also between the boers and the british the anglozulu war was fought in  between the british empire and the zulu kingdom following lord carnarvons successful introduction of federation in canada it was thought that similar political effort coupled with military campaigns might succeed with the african kingdoms tribal areas and boer republics in south africa in  sir henry bartle frere was sent to south africa as high commissioner for the british empire to bring such plans into being among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the south african republic and the kingdom of zululand and its army the zulu nation spectacularly defeated the british at the battle of isandlwana eventually though the war was lost resulting in the end of the zulu nations independence boers in combat  the boer republics successfully resisted british encroachments during the first boer war – using guerrilla warfare tactics which were well suited to local conditions the british returned with greater numbers more experience and new strategy in the second boer war – but suffered heavy casualties through attrition nonetheless they were ultimately successful independence within the country antibritish policies among white south africans focused on independence during the dutch and british colonial years racial segregation was mostly informal though some legislation was enacted to control the settlement and movement of native people including the native location act of  and the system of pass laws eight years after the end of the second boer war and after four years of negotiation an act of the british parliament south africa act  granted nominal independence while creating the union of south africa on  may  the union was a dominion that included the former territories of the cape and natal colonies as well as the republics of orange free state and transvaal the natives land act of  severely restricted the ownership of land by blacks at that stage natives controlled only  of the country the amount of land reserved for indigenous peoples was later marginally increased in  the union was fully sovereign from the united kingdom with the passage of the statute of westminster which abolished the last powers of the british

the entry of the union into world war ii as an ally of the united kingdom a move which the national party followers strongly opposed beginning of apartheid for use by white persons – apartheid sign in  the national party was elected to power it strengthened the racial segregation begun under dutch and british colonial rule the nationalist government classified all peoples into three races and developed rights and limitations for each the white minority less than  controlled the vastly larger black majority the legally institutionalised segregation became known as apartheid while whites enjoyed the highest standard of living in all of africa comparable to first world western nations the black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard including income education housing and life expectancy the freedom charter adopted in  by the congress alliance demanded a nonracial society and an end to discrimination republic on  may  the country became a republic following a referendum in which white voters narrowly voted in favour thereof the britishdominated natal province rallied against the issue queen elizabeth ii was stripped of the title queen of south africa and the last governorgeneral namely charles robberts swart became state president as a concession to the westminster system the presidency remained parliamentary appointed and virtually powerless until p w bothas constitution act of  which intact in these regards eliminated the office of prime minister and instated a nearunique strong presidency responsible to parliament pressured by other commonwealth of nations countries south africa withdrew from the organisation in  and rejoined it only in  despite opposition both within and outside the country the government legislated for a continuation of apartheid the security forces cracked down on internal dissent and violence became widespread with antiapartheid organisations such as the african national congress the azanian peoples organisation and the panafricanist congress carrying out guerrilla warfare and urban sabotage the three rival resistance movements also engaged in occasional interfactional clashes as they jockeyed for domestic influence apartheid became increasingly controversial and several countries began to boycott business with the south african government because of its racial policies these measures were later extended to international sanctions and the divestment of holdings by foreign investors f w de klerk and nelson mandela shake hands in january  in the late s south africa initiated a programme of nuclear weapons development in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons end of apartheid the mahlabatini declaration of faith signed by mangosuthu buthelezi and harry schwarz in  enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all the first of such agreements by black and white political leaders in south africa ultimately f w de klerk opened bilateral discussions with nelson mandela in  for a transition of policies and government in  the national party government took the first step towards dismantling discrimination when it lifted the ban on the african national congress and other political organisations it released nelson mandela from prison after twentyseven years serving a sentence for sabotage a negotiation process followed with approval from a predominantly white referendum the government repealed apartheid legislation south africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty south africa held its first universal elections in  which the anc won by an overwhelming majority it has been in power ever since the country rejoined the commonwealth of nations and became a member

country has struggled with many changes while many blacks have risen to middle or upper classes the overall unemployment rate of blacks worsened between  and  poverty among whites previously rare increased in addition the current government has struggled to achieve the monetary and fiscal discipline to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth since the ancled government took power the united nations human development index of south africa has fallen while it was steadily rising until the mids some may be attributed to the hivaids pandemic and the failure of the government to take steps to address it in the early years in may  riots left over sixty people dead the centre on housing rights and evictions estimates over  people were driven from their homes the targets were mainly migrants and refugees seeking asylum but a third of the victims were south african citizens in a  survey the south african migration project concluded that south africans are more opposed to immigration than anywhere else in the world the united nations high commissioner for refugees in  reported over  refugees applied for asylum in south africa almost four times as many as the year before these people were mainly from zimbabwe though many also come from burundi democratic republic of the congo rwanda eritrea ethiopia and somalia competition over jobs business opportunities public services and housing has led to tension between refugees and host communities while xenophobia is still a problem recent violence has not been as widespread as initially feared geography main article geography of south africa a map of south africa showing the main topographic features the central plateau edged by the great escarpment and the cape fold belt in the southwest corner of the country important geographical regions in south africa the thick line traces the course of the great escarpment which edges the central plateau the eastern portion of this line coloured red is known as the drakensberg the escarpment rises to its highest point at over  m where the drakensberg forms the border between kwazulunatal and lesotho none of the regions indicated on the map has a sharp welldefined border except where the escarpment or a range of mountains forms a clear dividing line between two regions some of the better known regions are coloured in the others are simply indicated by their names as they would be in an atlas south africa is located at the southernmost region of africa with a long coastline that stretches more than  km  mi and along two oceans the south atlantic

the prince edward islands the country lies between latitudes ° and °s and longitudes ° and °e the interior of south africa consists of a vast in most places almost flat plateau with an altitude of between  m  ft and  m  ft highest in the east and sloping gently downwards towards the west and north and slightly less noticeably so to the south and southwest this plateau is surrounded by the great escarpment whose eastern and highest stretch is known as the drakensberg the south and southwestern parts of the plateau at approximately – m above sea level and the adjoining plain below at approximately – m above sea level – see map on the right is known as the great karoo which consists of sparsely populated scrubland to the north the great karoo fades into the even drier and more arid bushmanland which eventually becomes the kalahari desert in the very northwest of the country the mideastern and highest part of the plateau is known as the highveld this relatively wellwatered area is home to a great proportion of the country’s commercial farmlands and contains its largest conurbation gauteng province to the north of highveld from about the °  s line of latitude the plateau slopes downwards into the bushveld which ultimately gives way to the limpopo lowlands or lowveld flat topped hills called karoo koppies are highly characteristic of the southern and southwestern karoo landscape these hills are capped by hard erosion resistant dolerite sills this is solidified lava that was forced under high pressure between the horizontal strata of the sedimentary rocks that make up most of the karoo’s geology about  million years ago since then southern africa has undergone a prolonged period of erosion removing the relatively soft karoo rocks except where they are protected by a cap of dolerite this photograph was taken near cradock in the eastern cape the coastal belt below the great escarpment moving clockwise from the northeast consists of the limpopo lowveld which merges into the mpumalanga lowveld below the mpumalanga drakensberg the eastern portion of the great escarpment this is hotter drier and less intensely cultivated than the highveld above the escarpment the kruger national park located in the provinces of limpopo and mpumalanga in northeastern south africa occupies a large portion of the lowveld covering  square kilometres  sq mi  south of the lowveld the annual rainfall increases as one enters kwazulunatal province which especially near the coast is subtropically hot and humid the kwazulunatal – lesotho international border is formed by the highest portion of the great escarpment or drakensberg which reaches an altitude of over  m  ft the climate at the foot of this part of the drakensberg is temperate drakensberg the eastern and highest portion of the great escarpment which surrounds the east south and western borders of the central plateau of southern africa the coastal belt below the south and southwestern stretches of the great escarpment contains several ranges of cape fold mountains which run parallel to the coast separating the great escarpment from the ocean these parallel ranges of fold mountains are shown on the map above left note the course of the great escarpment to the north of these mountain ranges the land at approximately – m above sea level between two of these ranges of fold mountains in the south ie between the outeniqua and langeberg ranges to the south and the swartberg range to the north is known as the little karoo which consists of semidesert scrubland similar to that of the great karoo except that its northern strip along the foothills of the swartberg mountains has a somewhat higher rainfall and is therefore more cultivated than the great karoo the little karoo is historically and still famous for its ostrich farming around the town of oudtshoorn the lowland area – m above sea level to the north of the swartberg mountain range up to the great escarpment is the lowland part of the great karoo see map at top right which is climatically and botanically almost indistinguishable from the karoo above the great escarpment the narrow coastal strip between the most seaward cape fold mountain range ie the langeberg–outeniqua mountains and the ocean has a moderately high yearround rainfall especially in the georgeknysnaplettenberg bay region which is known as the garden route it is famous for the most extensive areas of indigenous forests in south africa a generally forestpoor country in the southwest corner of the country the cape peninsula forms the southernmost tip of

article climate of south africa köppen climate types of south africa south africa has a generally temperate climate due in part to being surrounded by the atlantic and indian oceans on three sides by its location in the climatically milder southern hemisphere and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north towards the equator and further inland due to this varied topography and oceanic influence a great variety of climatic zones exist the climatic zones range from the extreme desert of the southern namib in the farthest northwest to the lush subtropical climate in the east along the mozambique border and the indian ocean winters in south africa occur between june and august the extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the mediterranean with wet winters and hot dry summers hosting the famous fynbos biome of shrubland and thicket this area also produces much of the wine in south africa this region is also particularly known for its wind which blows intermittently almost all year the severity of this wind made passing around the cape of good hope particularly treacherous for sailors causing many shipwrecks further east on the south coast rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year producing a green landscape this area is popularly known as the garden route the free state is particularly flat because it lies centrally on the high plateau north of the vaal river the highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat johannesburg in the centre of the highveld is at  m  ft and receives an annual rainfall of  mm  in winters in this region are cold although snow is rare the high drakensberg mountains which form the southeastern escarpment of the highveld offer limited skiing opportunities in winter the coldest place on mainland south africa is sutherland in the western roggeveld mountains where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as − °c  °f the prince edward islands have colder average annual temperatures but sutherland has colder extremes the deep interior of mainland south africa has the hottest temperatures a temperature of  °c  °f was recorded in  in the

communities of european white asian indian and multiracial coloured ancestry south africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures languages and religions its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitutions recognition of eleven official languages which is among the highest number of any country in the world two of these languages are of european origin afrikaans developed from dutch and serves as the first language of most white and coloured south africans english reflects the legacy of british colonialism and is commonly used in public and commercial life though it is fourthranked as a spoken first language the country is one of the few in africa never to have had a coup détat and regular elections have been held for almost a century however the vast majority of black south africans were not enfranchised until  during the twentieth century the black majority sought to recover its rights from the dominant white minority with this struggle playing a large role in the countrys recent history and politics the national party imposed the apartheid system in  institutionalising previous racial segregation after a long and sometimes violent struggle by the african national congress and other antiapartheid activists both inside and outside the country discriminatory laws began to be repealed or abolished from  onwards since  all ethnic and linguistic

recovered from a series of caves in gauteng province the area is a unesco world heritage site and has been termed the cradle of humankind the sites include sterkfontein which is one of the richest hominin fossil sites in the world other sites include swartkrans gondolin cave kromdraai coopers cave and malapa the first hominin fossil discovered in africa the taung child was found near taung in  further hominin remains have been recovered from the sites of makapansgat in limpopo cornelia and florisbad in the free state border cave in kwazulunatal klasies river mouth in eastern cape and pinnacle point elandsfontein and die kelders cave in western cape these sites suggest that various hominid species existed in south africa from about three million years ago starting with australopithecus africanus these were succeeded by various species including australopithecus sediba homo ergaster homo erectus homo rhodesiensis homo helmei homo naledi and modern humans homo sapiens modern humans have inhabited southern africa for at least  years within the vaal river valley pebble tools have been located bantu expansion mapungubwe hill the site of the former capital of the kingdom of mapungubwe settlements of bantuspeaking peoples who were ironusing agriculturists and herdsmen were already present south of the limpopo river now the northern border with botswana and zimbabwe by the th or th century ce see bantu expansion they displaced conquered and absorbed the original khoisan speakers the khoikhoi and san peoples the bantu slowly moved south the earliest ironworks in modernday kwazulunatal province are believed to date from around  the southernmost group was the xhosa people whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier khoisan people the xhosa reached the great fish river in todays eastern cape province as they migrated these larger iron age populations displaced or assimilated earlier peoples in mpumalanga several stone circles have been found along with the stone arrangement that has been named adams calendar portuguese contacts at the time of european contact the dominant ethnic group were bantuspeaking peoples who had migrated from other parts of africa about one thousand years before the two major historic groups were the xhosa and zulu peoples in  the portuguese explorer bartolomeu dias led the first european voyage to land in southern africa on  december he landed at walfisch bay now known as walvis bay in presentday namibia this was south of the furthest point reached in  by his predecessor the portuguese navigator diogo cão cape cross north of the bay dias continued down the western coast of southern africa after  january  prevented by storms from proceeding along the coast he sailed out of sight of land and passed the southernmost point of africa without seeing it he reached as far up the eastern coast of africa as what he called rio do infante probably the presentday groot river in may  but on his return he saw the cape which he first named cabo das tormentas cape of storms his king john ii renamed the point cabo da boa esperança or cape of good hope as it led to the riches of the east indies dias feat of navigation was later immortalised in luís de camões portuguese epic poem the lusiads  dutch colonisation see also history of cape colony and dutch cape colony charles davidson bells thcentury painting of jan van riebeeck who founded the first european settlement in south africa arrives in table bay in  by the early th century portugals maritime power was starting to decline and english and dutch merchants competed to oust lisbon from its lucrative monopoly on the spice trade representatives of the british east india company did call sporadically at the cape in search of provisions as early as  but later came to favour ascension island and st helena as alternative ports of refuge dutch interest was aroused after  when two employees of the dutch east india company voc were shipwrecked there for several months the sailors were able to survive by obtaining fresh water and meat from the natives they also sowed vegetables in the fertile soil upon their return to holland they reported favourably on the capes potential as a warehouse and garden for provisions to stock passing ships for long voyages in  a century and a half after the discovery of the cape sea route jan van riebeeck established a victualing station at the cape of good hope at what would become cape town on behalf of the dutch east india company in time the cape become home to a large population of vrijlieden also known as vrijburgers free citizens former company employees who stayed in dutch territories overseas after serving their contracts dutch traders also imported thousands of slaves to the fledgling colony from indonesia madagascar and parts of eastern africa some of the earliest mixed race communities in the country were later formed through unions between vrijburgers their slaves and various indigenous peoples this led to the development of a new ethnic group the cape coloureds most of whom adopted the dutch language and christian faith the eastward expansion of dutch colonists ushered in a series of wars with the southwesterly migrating xhosa tribe as both sides competed for the pastureland necessary to graze their cattle near the great fish river vrijburgers who became independent farmers on the frontier were known as boers with some adopting seminomadic lifestyles being denoted as trekboers the boers formed loose militias which they termed commandos and forged alliances with khoisan groups to repel xhosa raids both sides launched bloody but inconclusive offensives and sporadic violence often accompanied by livestock theft remained common for several decades british colonisation great britain occupied cape town between  and  to prevent it from falling under the control of the french first republic which had invaded the low countries despite briefly returning to dutch rule under the batavian republic in  the cape was occupied again by the british in  following the end of the napoleonic wars it was formally ceded to great britain and became an integral part of the british empire british immigration to south africa began around  subsequently culminating in the arrival of the  settlers the new colonists were induced to settle for a variety of reasons namely to increase the size of the european workforce and to bolster frontier regions against xhosa incursions depiction of a zulu attack on a boer camp in february  in the first two decades of the th century the zulu people grew in power and expanded their territory under their leader shaka shakas warfare led indirectly to the mfecane crushing that devastated and depopulated the inland plateau in the early s an offshoot of the zulu the matabele people created a larger empire that included large parts of the highveld under their king mzilikazi during the early s many dutch settlers departed from the cape colony where they had been subjected to british control they migrated to the future natal orange free state and transvaal regions the boers founded the boer republics the south african republic now gauteng limpopo mpumalanga and north west provinces and the orange free state free state the discovery of diamonds in  and gold in  in the interior started the mineral revolution and increased economic growth and immigration this intensified british efforts to gain control over the indigenous peoples the struggle to control these important economic resources was a factor in relations between europeans and the indigenous population and also between the boers and the british the anglozulu war was fought in  between the british empire and the zulu kingdom following lord carnarvons successful introduction of federation in canada it was thought that similar political effort coupled with military campaigns might succeed with the african kingdoms tribal areas and boer republics in south africa in  sir henry bartle frere was sent to south africa as high commissioner for the british empire to bring such plans into being among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the south african republic and the kingdom of zululand and its army the zulu nation spectacularly defeated the british at the battle of isandlwana eventually though the war was lost resulting in the end of the zulu nations independence boers in combat  the boer republics successfully resisted british encroachments during the first boer war – using guerrilla warfare tactics which were well suited to local conditions the british returned with greater numbers more experience and new strategy in the second boer war – but suffered heavy casualties through attrition nonetheless they were ultimately successful independence within the country antibritish policies among white south africans focused on independence during the dutch and british colonial years racial segregation was mostly informal though some legislation was enacted to control the settlement and movement of native people including the native location act of  and the system of pass laws eight years after the end of the second boer war and after four years of negotiation an act of the british parliament south africa act  granted nominal independence while creating the union of south africa on  may  the union was a dominion that included the former territories of the cape and natal colonies as well as the republics of orange free state and transvaal the natives land act of  severely restricted the ownership of land by blacks at that stage natives controlled only  of the country the amount of land reserved for indigenous peoples was later marginally increased in  the union was fully sovereign from the united kingdom with the passage of the statute of westminster which abolished the last powers of the british government on the country in  the south african party and national party merged to form the united party seeking reconciliation between afrikaners and englishspeaking whites in  the party split over the entry of the union into world war ii as an ally of the united kingdom a move which the national party followers strongly opposed beginning of apartheid for use by white persons – apartheid sign in  the national party was elected to power it strengthened the racial segregation begun under dutch and british colonial rule the nationalist government classified all peoples into three races and developed rights and limitations for each the white minority less than  controlled the vastly larger black majority the legally institutionalised segregation became known as apartheid while whites enjoyed the highest standard of living in all of africa comparable to first world western nations the black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard including income education housing and life expectancy the freedom charter adopted in  by the congress alliance demanded a nonracial society and an end to discrimination republic on  may  the country became a republic following a referendum in which white voters narrowly voted in favour thereof the britishdominated natal province rallied against the issue queen elizabeth ii was stripped of the title queen of south africa and the last governorgeneral namely charles robberts swart became state president as a concession to the westminster system the presidency remained parliamentary appointed and virtually powerless until p w bothas constitution act of  which intact in these regards eliminated the office of prime minister and instated a nearunique strong presidency responsible to parliament pressured by other commonwealth of nations countries south africa withdrew from the organisation in  and rejoined it only in  despite opposition both within and outside the country the government legislated for a continuation of apartheid the security forces cracked down on internal dissent and violence became widespread with antiapartheid organisations such as the african national congress the azanian peoples organisation and the panafricanist congress carrying out guerrilla warfare and urban sabotage the three rival resistance movements also engaged in occasional interfactional clashes as they jockeyed for domestic influence apartheid became increasingly controversial and several countries began to boycott business with the south african government because of its racial policies these measures were later extended to international sanctions and the divestment of holdings by foreign investors f w de klerk and nelson mandela shake hands in january  in the late s south africa initiated a programme of nuclear weapons development in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons end of apartheid the mahlabatini declaration of faith signed by mangosuthu buthelezi and harry schwarz in  enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all the first of such agreements by black and white political leaders in south africa ultimately f w de klerk opened bilateral discussions with nelson mandela in  for a transition of policies and government in  the national party government took the first step towards dismantling discrimination when it lifted the ban on the african national congress and other political organisations it released nelson mandela from prison after twentyseven years serving a sentence for sabotage a negotiation process followed with approval from a predominantly white referendum the government repealed apartheid legislation south africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty south africa held its first universal elections in  which the anc won by an overwhelming majority it has been in power ever since the country rejoined the commonwealth of nations and became a member of the southern african development community sadc nelson mandela first black african president of republic of south africa in postapartheid south africa unemployment has been extremely high as the country has struggled with many changes while many blacks have risen to middle or upper classes the overall unemployment rate of blacks worsened between  and  poverty among whites previously rare increased in addition the current government has struggled to achieve the monetary and fiscal discipline to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth since the ancled government took power the united nations human development index of south africa has fallen while it was steadily rising until the mids some may be attributed to the hivaids pandemic and the failure of the government to take steps to address it in the early years in may  riots left over sixty people dead the centre on housing rights and evictions estimates over  people were driven from their homes the targets were mainly migrants and refugees seeking asylum but a third of the victims were south african citizens in a  survey the south african migration project concluded that south africans are more opposed to immigration than anywhere else in the world the united nations high commissioner for refugees in  reported over  refugees applied for asylum in south africa almost four times as many as the year before these people were mainly from zimbabwe though many also come from burundi democratic republic of the congo rwanda eritrea ethiopia and somalia competition over jobs business opportunities public services and housing has led to tension between refugees and host communities while xenophobia is still a problem recent violence has not been as widespread as initially feared geography main article geography of south africa a map of south africa showing the main topographic features the central plateau edged by the great escarpment and the cape fold belt in the southwest corner of the country important geographical regions in south africa the thick line traces the course of the great escarpment which edges the central plateau the eastern portion of this line coloured red is known as the drakensberg the escarpment rises to its highest point at over  m where the drakensberg forms the border between kwazulunatal and lesotho none of the regions indicated on the map has a sharp welldefined border except where the escarpment or a range of mountains forms a clear dividing line between two regions some of the better known regions are coloured in the others are simply indicated by their names as they would be in an atlas south africa is located at the southernmost region of africa with a long coastline that stretches more than  km  mi and along two oceans the south atlantic and the indian at  km  sq mi south africa is the thlargest country in the world and is comparable in size to colombia mafadi in the drakensberg at  m  ft is the highest peak in south africa excluding the prince edward islands the country lies between latitudes ° and °s and longitudes ° and °e the interior of south africa consists of a vast in most places almost flat plateau with an altitude of between  m  ft and  m  ft highest in the east and sloping gently downwards towards the west and north and slightly less noticeably so to the south and southwest this plateau is surrounded by the great escarpment whose eastern and highest stretch is known as the drakensberg the south and southwestern parts of the plateau at approximately – m above sea level and the adjoining plain below at approximately – m above sea level – see map on the right is known as the great karoo which consists of sparsely populated scrubland to the north the great karoo fades into the even drier and more arid bushmanland which eventually becomes the kalahari desert in the very northwest of the country the mideastern and highest part of the plateau is known as the highveld this relatively wellwatered area is home to a great proportion of the country’s commercial farmlands and contains its largest conurbation gauteng province to the north of highveld from about the °  s line of latitude the plateau slopes downwards into the bushveld which ultimately gives way to the limpopo lowlands or lowveld flat topped hills called karoo koppies are highly characteristic of the southern and southwestern karoo landscape these hills are capped by hard erosion resistant dolerite sills this is solidified lava that was forced under high pressure between the horizontal strata of the sedimentary rocks that make up most of the karoo’s geology about  million years ago since then southern africa has undergone a prolonged period of erosion removing the relatively soft karoo rocks except where they are protected by a cap of dolerite this photograph was taken near cradock in the eastern cape the coastal belt below the great escarpment moving clockwise from the northeast consists of the limpopo lowveld which merges into the mpumalanga lowveld below the mpumalanga drakensberg the eastern portion of the great escarpment this is hotter drier and less intensely cultivated than the highveld above the escarpment the kruger national park located in the provinces of limpopo and mpumalanga in northeastern south africa occupies a large portion of the lowveld covering  square kilometres  sq mi  south of the lowveld the annual rainfall increases as one enters kwazulunatal province which especially near the coast is subtropically hot and humid the kwazulunatal – lesotho international border is formed by the highest portion of the great escarpment or drakensberg which reaches an altitude of over  m  ft the climate at the foot of this part of the drakensberg is temperate drakensberg the eastern and highest portion of the great escarpment which surrounds the east south and western borders of the central plateau of southern africa the coastal belt below the south and southwestern stretches of the great escarpment contains several ranges of cape fold mountains which run parallel to the coast separating the great escarpment from the ocean these parallel ranges of fold mountains are shown on the map above left note the course of the great escarpment to the north of these mountain ranges the land at approximately – m above sea level between two of these ranges of fold mountains in the south ie between the outeniqua and langeberg ranges to the south and the swartberg range to the north is known as the little karoo which consists of semidesert scrubland similar to that of the great karoo except that its northern strip along the foothills of the swartberg mountains has a somewhat higher rainfall and is therefore more cultivated than the great karoo the little karoo is historically and still famous for its ostrich farming around the town of oudtshoorn the lowland area – m above sea level to the north of the swartberg mountain range up to the great escarpment is the lowland part of the great karoo see map at top right which is climatically and botanically almost indistinguishable from the karoo above the great escarpment the narrow coastal strip between the most seaward cape fold mountain range ie the langeberg–outeniqua mountains and the ocean has a moderately high yearround rainfall especially in the georgeknysnaplettenberg bay region which is known as the garden route it is famous for the most extensive areas of indigenous forests in south africa a generally forestpoor country in the southwest corner of the country the cape peninsula forms the southernmost tip of the coastal strip which borders the atlantic ocean and ultimately terminates at the country’s border with namibia at the orange river the cape peninsula has a mediterranean climate making it and its immediate surrounds the only portion of africa south of the sahara which receives most of its rainfall in winter the greater cape town metropolitan area is situated on the cape peninsula and is home to  million people according to the  population census it is the countrys legislative capital spring flowers in namaqualand the coastal belt to the north of the cape peninsula is bounded on the west by the atlantic ocean and the first row of northsouth running cape fold mountains to the east the cape fold mountains peter out at about the ° s line of latitude after which the coastal plain is bounded by the great escarpment itself the most southerly portion of this coastal belt is known as the swartland and malmesbury plain which is an important wheat growing region relying on winter rains the region further north is known as namaqualand which becomes more and more arid as one approaches the orange river the little rain that falls tends to fall in winter which results in one of the world’s most spectacular displays of flowers carpeting huge stretches of veld in spring august–september cape floral region protected areas south africa also has one possession the small subantarctic archipelago of the prince edward islands consisting of marion island  km or  sq mi and prince edward island  km or  sq mi not to be confused with the canadian province of the same name climate main article climate of south africa köppen climate types of south africa south africa has a generally temperate climate due in part to being surrounded by the atlantic and indian oceans on three sides by its location in the climatically milder southern hemisphere and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north towards the equator and further inland due to this varied topography and oceanic influence a great variety of climatic zones exist the climatic zones range from the extreme desert of the southern namib in the farthest northwest to the lush subtropical climate in the east along the mozambique border and the indian ocean winters in south africa occur between june and august the extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the mediterranean with wet winters and hot dry summers hosting the famous fynbos biome of shrubland and thicket this area also produces much of the wine in south africa this region is also particularly known for its wind which

african ancestry divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different bantu languages nine of which have official status the remaining population consists of africas largest communities of european white asian indian and multiracial coloured ancestry south africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures languages and religions its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitutions recognition of eleven official languages which is among the highest number of any country in the world two of these languages are of european origin afrikaans developed from dutch and serves as the first language of most white and coloured south africans english reflects the legacy of british colonialism and is commonly used in public and commercial life though it is fourthranked as a spoken first language the country is one of the few in africa never to have had a coup détat and regular elections have been held for almost a century however the vast majority of black south africans were not enfranchised until  during the twentieth century the black majority sought to recover its rights from the dominant white minority with this struggle playing a large role in the countrys recent history and politics the national party imposed the apartheid system in  institutionalising previous racial segregation after a long and sometimes violent struggle by the african national congress and other antiapartheid activists both inside and outside the country discriminatory laws began to be repealed or abolished from  onwards since  all ethnic and linguistic groups have held political representation in the countrys democracy which comprises a parliamentary republic and nine provinces south africa is often referred to as the rainbow nation to describe the countrys multicultural diversity especially in the wake of apartheid the world bank classifies south africa as an uppermiddleincome economy and a newly industrialised country its economy is the secondlargest in africa and the thlargest in the world in terms of purchasing power parity south africa has the seventhhighest per capita income in africa however poverty and inequality remain

azania history main article history of south africa prehistoric finds south africa contains some of the oldest archaeological and human fossil sites in the world extensive fossil remains have been recovered from a series of caves in gauteng province the area is a unesco world heritage site and has been termed the cradle of humankind the sites include sterkfontein which is one of the richest hominin fossil sites in the world other sites include swartkrans gondolin cave kromdraai coopers cave and malapa the first hominin fossil discovered in africa the taung child was found near taung in  further hominin remains have been recovered from the sites of makapansgat in limpopo cornelia and florisbad in the free state border cave in kwazulunatal klasies river mouth in eastern cape and pinnacle point elandsfontein and die kelders cave in western cape these sites suggest that various hominid species existed in south africa from about three million years ago starting with australopithecus africanus these were succeeded by various species including australopithecus sediba homo ergaster homo erectus homo rhodesiensis homo helmei homo naledi and modern humans homo sapiens modern humans have inhabited southern africa for at least  years within the vaal river valley pebble tools have been located bantu expansion mapungubwe hill the site of the former capital of the kingdom of mapungubwe settlements of bantuspeaking peoples who were ironusing agriculturists and herdsmen were already present south of the limpopo river now the northern border with botswana and zimbabwe by the th or th century ce see bantu expansion they displaced conquered and absorbed the original khoisan speakers the khoikhoi and san peoples the bantu slowly moved south the earliest ironworks in modernday kwazulunatal province are believed to date from around  the southernmost group was the xhosa people whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier khoisan people the xhosa reached the great fish river in todays eastern cape province as they migrated these larger iron age populations displaced or assimilated earlier peoples in mpumalanga several stone circles have been found along with the stone arrangement that has been named adams calendar portuguese contacts at the time of european contact the dominant ethnic group were bantuspeaking peoples who had migrated from other parts of africa about one thousand years before the two major historic groups were the xhosa and zulu peoples in  the portuguese explorer bartolomeu dias led the first european voyage to land in southern africa on  december he landed at walfisch bay now known as walvis bay in presentday namibia this was south of the furthest point reached in  by his predecessor the portuguese navigator diogo cão cape cross north of the bay dias continued down the western coast of southern africa after  january  prevented by storms from proceeding along the coast he sailed out of sight of land and passed the southernmost point of africa without seeing it he reached as far up the eastern coast of africa as what he called rio do infante probably the presentday groot river in may  but on his return he saw the cape which he first named cabo das tormentas cape of storms his king john ii renamed the point cabo da boa esperança or cape of good hope as it led to the riches of the east indies dias feat of navigation was later immortalised in luís de camões portuguese epic poem the lusiads  dutch colonisation see also history of cape colony and dutch cape colony charles davidson bells thcentury painting of jan van riebeeck who founded the first european settlement in south africa arrives in table bay in  by the early th century portugals maritime power was starting to decline and english and dutch merchants competed to oust lisbon from its lucrative monopoly on the spice trade representatives of the british east india company did call sporadically at the cape in search of provisions as early as  but later came to favour ascension island and st helena as alternative ports of refuge dutch interest was aroused after  when two employees of the dutch east india company voc were shipwrecked there for several months the sailors were able to survive by obtaining fresh water and meat from the natives they also sowed vegetables in the fertile soil upon their return to holland they reported favourably on the capes potential as a warehouse and garden for provisions to stock passing ships for long voyages in  a century and a half after the discovery of the cape sea route jan van riebeeck established a victualing station at the cape of good hope at what would become cape town on behalf of the dutch east india company in time the cape become home to a large population of vrijlieden also known as vrijburgers free citizens former company employees who stayed in dutch territories overseas after serving their contracts dutch traders also imported thousands of slaves to the fledgling colony from indonesia madagascar and parts of eastern africa some of the earliest mixed race communities in the country were later formed through unions between vrijburgers their slaves and various indigenous peoples this led to the development of a new ethnic group the cape coloureds most of whom adopted the dutch language and christian faith the eastward expansion of dutch colonists ushered in a series of wars with the southwesterly migrating xhosa tribe as both sides competed for the pastureland necessary to graze their cattle near the great fish river vrijburgers who became independent farmers on the frontier were known as boers with some adopting seminomadic lifestyles being denoted as trekboers the boers formed loose militias which they termed commandos and forged alliances with khoisan groups to repel xhosa raids both sides launched bloody but inconclusive offensives and sporadic violence often accompanied by livestock theft remained common for several decades british colonisation great britain occupied cape town between  and  to prevent it from falling under the control of the french first republic which had invaded the low countries despite briefly returning to dutch rule under the batavian republic in  the cape was occupied again by the british in  following the end of the napoleonic wars it was formally ceded to great britain and became an integral part of the british empire british immigration to south africa began around  subsequently culminating in the arrival of the  settlers the new colonists were induced to settle for a variety of reasons namely to increase the size of the european workforce and to bolster frontier regions against xhosa incursions depiction of a zulu attack on a boer camp in february  in the first two decades of the th century the zulu people grew in power and expanded their territory under their leader shaka shakas warfare led indirectly to the mfecane crushing that devastated and depopulated the inland plateau in the early s an offshoot of the zulu the matabele people created a larger empire that included large parts of the highveld under their king mzilikazi during the early s many dutch settlers departed from the cape colony where they had been subjected to british control they migrated to the future natal orange free state and transvaal regions the boers founded the boer republics the south african republic now gauteng limpopo mpumalanga and north west provinces and the orange free state free state the discovery of diamonds in  and gold in  in the interior started the mineral revolution and increased economic growth and immigration this intensified british efforts to gain control over the indigenous peoples the struggle to control these important economic resources was a factor in relations between europeans and the indigenous population and also between the boers and the british the anglozulu war was fought in  between the british empire and the zulu kingdom following lord carnarvons successful introduction of federation in canada it was thought that similar political effort coupled with military campaigns might succeed with the african kingdoms tribal areas and boer republics in south africa in  sir henry bartle frere was sent to south africa as high commissioner for the british empire to bring such plans into being among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the south african republic and the kingdom of zululand and its army the zulu nation spectacularly defeated the british at the battle of isandlwana eventually though the war was lost resulting in the end of the zulu nations independence boers in combat  the boer republics successfully resisted british encroachments during the first boer war – using guerrilla warfare tactics which were well suited to local conditions the british returned with greater numbers more experience and new strategy in the second boer war – but suffered heavy casualties through attrition nonetheless they were ultimately successful independence within the country antibritish policies among white south africans focused on independence during the dutch and british colonial years racial segregation was mostly informal though some legislation was enacted to control the settlement and movement of native people including the native location act of  and the system of pass laws eight years after the end of the second boer war and after four years of negotiation an act of the british parliament south africa act  granted nominal independence while creating the union of south africa on  may  the union was a dominion that included the former territories of the cape and natal colonies as well as the republics of orange free state and transvaal the natives land act of  severely restricted the ownership of land by blacks at that stage natives controlled only  of the country the amount of land reserved for indigenous peoples was later marginally increased in  the union was fully sovereign from the united kingdom with the passage of the statute of westminster which abolished the last powers of the british government on the country in  the south african party and national party merged to form the united party seeking reconciliation between afrikaners and englishspeaking whites in  the party split over the entry of the union into world war ii as an ally of the united kingdom a move which the national party followers strongly opposed beginning of apartheid for use by white persons – apartheid sign in  the national party was elected to power it strengthened the racial segregation begun under dutch and british colonial rule the nationalist government classified all peoples into three races and developed rights and limitations for each the white minority less than  controlled the vastly larger black majority the legally institutionalised segregation became known as apartheid while whites enjoyed the highest standard of living in all of africa comparable to first world western nations the black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard including income education housing and life expectancy the freedom charter adopted in  by the congress alliance demanded a nonracial society and an end to discrimination republic on  may  the country became a republic following a referendum in which white voters narrowly voted in favour thereof the britishdominated natal province rallied against the issue queen elizabeth ii was stripped of the title queen of south africa and the last governorgeneral namely charles robberts swart became state president as a concession to the westminster system the presidency remained parliamentary appointed and virtually powerless until p w bothas constitution act of  which intact in these regards eliminated the office of prime minister and instated a nearunique strong presidency responsible to parliament pressured by other commonwealth of nations countries south africa withdrew from the organisation in  and rejoined it only in  despite opposition both within and outside the country the government legislated for a continuation of apartheid the security forces cracked down on internal dissent and violence became widespread with antiapartheid organisations such as the african national congress the azanian peoples organisation and the panafricanist congress carrying out guerrilla warfare and urban sabotage the three rival resistance movements also engaged in occasional interfactional clashes as they jockeyed for domestic influence apartheid became increasingly controversial and several countries began to boycott business with the south african government because of its racial policies these measures were later extended to international sanctions and the divestment of holdings by foreign investors f w de klerk and nelson mandela shake hands in january  in the late s south africa initiated a programme of nuclear weapons development in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons end of apartheid the mahlabatini declaration of faith signed by mangosuthu buthelezi and harry schwarz in  enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all the first of such agreements by black and white political leaders in south africa ultimately f w de klerk opened bilateral discussions with nelson mandela in  for a transition of policies and government in  the national party government took the first step towards dismantling discrimination when it lifted the ban on the african national congress and other political organisations it released nelson mandela from prison after twentyseven years serving a sentence for sabotage a negotiation process followed with approval from a predominantly white referendum the government repealed apartheid legislation south africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty south africa held its first universal elections in  which the anc won by an overwhelming majority it has been in power ever since the country rejoined the commonwealth of nations and became a member of the southern african development community sadc nelson mandela first black african president of republic of south africa in postapartheid south africa unemployment has been extremely high as the country has struggled with many changes while many blacks have risen to middle or upper classes the overall unemployment rate of blacks worsened between  and  poverty among whites previously rare increased in addition the current government has struggled to achieve the monetary and fiscal discipline to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth since the ancled government took power the united nations human development index of south africa has fallen while it was steadily rising until the mids some may be attributed to the hivaids pandemic and the failure of the government to take steps to address it in the early years in may  riots left over sixty people dead the centre on housing rights and evictions estimates over  people were driven from their homes the targets were mainly migrants and refugees seeking asylum but a third of the victims were south african citizens in a  survey the south african migration project concluded that south africans are more opposed to immigration than anywhere else in the world the united nations high commissioner for refugees in  reported over  refugees applied for asylum in south africa almost four times as many as the year before these people were mainly from zimbabwe though many also come from burundi democratic republic of the congo rwanda eritrea ethiopia and somalia competition over jobs business opportunities public services and housing has led to tension between refugees and host communities while xenophobia is still a problem recent violence has not been as widespread as initially feared geography main article geography of south africa a map of south africa showing the main topographic features the central plateau edged by the great escarpment and the cape fold belt in the southwest corner of the country important geographical regions in south africa the thick line traces the course of the great escarpment which edges the central plateau the eastern portion of this line coloured red is known as the drakensberg the escarpment rises to its highest point at over  m where the drakensberg forms the border between kwazulunatal and lesotho none of the regions indicated on the map has a sharp welldefined border except where the escarpment or a range of mountains forms a clear dividing line between two regions some of the better known regions are coloured in the others are simply indicated by their names as they would be in an atlas south africa is located at the southernmost region of africa with a long coastline that stretches more than  km  mi and along two oceans the south atlantic and the indian at  km  sq mi south africa is the thlargest country in the world and is comparable in size to colombia mafadi in the drakensberg at  m  ft is the highest peak in south africa excluding the prince edward islands the country lies between latitudes ° and °s and longitudes ° and °e the interior of south africa consists of a vast in most places almost flat plateau with an altitude of between  m  ft and  m  ft highest in the east and sloping gently downwards towards the west and north and slightly less noticeably so to the south and southwest this plateau is surrounded by the great escarpment whose eastern and highest stretch is known as the drakensberg the south and southwestern parts of the plateau at approximately – m above sea level and the adjoining plain below at approximately – m above sea level – see map on the right is known as the great karoo which consists of sparsely populated scrubland to the north the great karoo fades into the even drier and more arid bushmanland which eventually becomes the kalahari desert in the very northwest of the country the mideastern and highest part of the plateau is known as the highveld this relatively wellwatered area is home to a great proportion of the country’s commercial farmlands and contains its largest conurbation gauteng province to the north of highveld from about the °  s line of latitude the plateau slopes downwards into the bushveld which ultimately gives way to the limpopo lowlands or lowveld flat topped hills called karoo koppies are highly characteristic of the southern and southwestern karoo landscape these hills are capped by hard erosion resistant dolerite sills this is solidified lava that was forced under high pressure between the horizontal strata of the sedimentary rocks that make up most of the karoo’s geology about  million years ago since then southern africa has undergone a prolonged period of erosion removing the relatively soft karoo rocks except where they are protected by a cap of dolerite this photograph was taken near cradock in the eastern cape the coastal belt below the great escarpment moving clockwise from the northeast consists of the limpopo lowveld which merges into the mpumalanga lowveld below the mpumalanga drakensberg the eastern portion of the great escarpment this is hotter drier and less intensely cultivated than the highveld above the escarpment the kruger national park located in the provinces of limpopo and mpumalanga in northeastern south africa occupies a large portion of the lowveld covering  square kilometres  sq mi  south of the lowveld the annual rainfall increases as one enters kwazulunatal province which especially near the coast is subtropically hot and humid the kwazulunatal – lesotho international border is formed by the highest portion of the great escarpment or drakensberg which reaches an altitude of over  m  ft the climate at the foot of this part of the drakensberg is temperate drakensberg the eastern and highest portion of the great escarpment which surrounds the east south and western borders of the central plateau of southern africa the coastal belt below the south and southwestern stretches of the great escarpment contains several ranges of cape fold mountains which run parallel to the coast separating the great escarpment from the ocean these parallel ranges of fold mountains are shown on the map above left note the course of the great escarpment to the north of these mountain ranges the land at approximately – m above sea level between two of these ranges of fold mountains in the south ie between the outeniqua and langeberg ranges to the south and the swartberg range to the north is known as the little karoo which consists of semidesert scrubland similar to that of the great karoo except that its northern strip along the foothills of the swartberg mountains has a somewhat higher rainfall and is therefore more cultivated than the great karoo the little karoo is historically and still famous for its ostrich farming around the town of oudtshoorn the lowland area – m above sea level to the north of the swartberg mountain range up to the great escarpment is the lowland part of the great karoo see map at top right which is climatically and botanically almost indistinguishable from the karoo above the great escarpment the narrow coastal strip between the most seaward cape fold mountain range ie the langeberg–outeniqua mountains and the ocean has a moderately high yearround rainfall especially in the georgeknysnaplettenberg bay region which is known as the garden route it is famous for the most extensive areas of indigenous forests in south africa a generally forestpoor country in the southwest corner of the country the cape peninsula forms the southernmost tip of the coastal strip which borders the atlantic ocean and ultimately terminates at the country’s border with namibia at the orange river the cape peninsula has a mediterranean climate making it and its immediate surrounds the only portion of africa south of the sahara which receives most of its rainfall in winter the greater cape town metropolitan area is situated on the cape peninsula and is home to  million people according to the  population census it is the countrys legislative capital spring flowers in namaqualand the coastal belt to the north of the cape peninsula is bounded on the west by the atlantic ocean and the first row of northsouth running cape fold mountains to the east the cape fold mountains peter out at about the ° s line of latitude after which the coastal plain is bounded by the great escarpment itself the most southerly portion of this coastal belt is known as the swartland and malmesbury plain which is an important wheat growing region relying on winter rains the region further north is known as namaqualand which becomes more and more arid as one approaches the orange river the little rain that falls tends to fall in winter which results in one of the world’s most spectacular displays of flowers carpeting huge stretches of veld in spring august–september cape floral region protected areas south africa also has one possession the small subantarctic archipelago of the prince edward islands consisting of marion island  km or  sq mi and prince edward island  km or  sq mi not to be confused with the canadian province of the same name climate main article climate of south africa köppen climate types of south africa south africa has a generally temperate climate due in part to being surrounded by the atlantic and indian oceans on three sides by its location in the climatically milder southern hemisphere and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north towards the equator and further inland due to this varied topography and oceanic influence a great variety of climatic zones exist the climatic zones range from the extreme desert of the southern namib in the farthest northwest to the lush subtropical climate in the east

consists of africas largest communities of european white asian indian and multiracial coloured ancestry south africa is a multiethnic society encompassing a wide variety of cultures languages and religions its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the constitutions recognition of eleven official languages which is among the highest number of any country in the world two of these languages are of european origin afrikaans developed from dutch and serves as the first language of most white and coloured south africans english reflects the legacy of british colonialism and is commonly used in public and commercial life though it is fourthranked as a spoken first language the country is one of the few in africa never to have had a coup détat and regular elections have been held for almost a century however the vast majority of black south africans were not enfranchised until  during the twentieth century the black majority sought to recover its rights from the dominant white minority with this struggle playing a large role in the countrys recent history and politics the national party imposed the apartheid system in  institutionalising previous racial segregation after a long and sometimes violent struggle by the african national congress and other antiapartheid activists both inside and outside the country discriminatory laws began to be repealed or abolished from  onwards

the world extensive fossil remains have been recovered from a series of caves in gauteng province the area is a unesco world heritage site and has been termed the cradle of humankind the sites include sterkfontein which is one of the richest hominin fossil sites in the world other sites include swartkrans gondolin cave kromdraai coopers cave and malapa the first hominin fossil discovered in africa the taung child was found near taung in  further hominin remains have been recovered from the sites of makapansgat in limpopo cornelia and florisbad in the free state border cave in kwazulunatal klasies river mouth in eastern cape and pinnacle point elandsfontein and die kelders cave in western cape these sites suggest that various hominid species existed in south africa from about three million years ago starting with australopithecus africanus these were succeeded by various species including australopithecus sediba homo ergaster homo erectus homo rhodesiensis homo helmei homo naledi and modern humans homo sapiens modern humans have inhabited southern africa for at least  years within the vaal river valley pebble tools have been located bantu expansion mapungubwe hill the

northern border with botswana and zimbabwe by the th or th century ce see bantu expansion they displaced conquered and absorbed the original khoisan speakers the khoikhoi and san peoples the bantu slowly moved south the earliest ironworks in modernday kwazulunatal province are believed to date from around  the southernmost group was the xhosa people whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier khoisan people the xhosa reached the great fish river in todays eastern cape province as they migrated these larger iron age populations displaced or assimilated earlier peoples in mpumalanga several stone circles have been found along with the stone arrangement that has been named adams calendar portuguese contacts at the time of european contact the dominant ethnic group were bantuspeaking peoples who had migrated from other parts of africa about one thousand years before the two major historic groups were the xhosa and zulu peoples in  the portuguese explorer bartolomeu dias led the first european voyage to land in southern africa on  december he landed at walfisch bay now known as walvis bay in presentday namibia this was south of the furthest point reached in  by his predecessor the portuguese navigator diogo cão cape cross north of the bay dias continued down the western coast of southern africa after  january  prevented by storms from proceeding along the coast he sailed out of sight of land and passed the southernmost point of africa without seeing it he reached as far up the eastern coast of africa as what he called rio do infante probably the presentday groot river in may  but on his return he saw the cape which he first named cabo das tormentas cape of storms his king john ii renamed the point cabo da boa esperança or cape of good hope as it led to the riches of the east indies dias feat of navigation was later immortalised in luís de camões portuguese epic poem the lusiads  dutch colonisation see also history of cape colony and dutch cape colony charles davidson bells thcentury painting of jan van riebeeck who founded the first european settlement in south africa arrives in table bay in  by the early th century portugals maritime power was starting to decline and english and dutch merchants competed to oust lisbon from its lucrative monopoly on the spice trade representatives of the british east india company did call sporadically at the cape in search of provisions as early as  but later came to favour ascension island and st helena as alternative ports of refuge dutch interest was aroused after  when two employees of the dutch east india company voc were shipwrecked there for several months the sailors were able to survive by obtaining fresh water and meat from the natives they also sowed vegetables in the fertile soil upon their return to holland they reported favourably on the capes potential as a warehouse and garden for provisions to stock passing ships for long voyages in  a century and a half after the discovery of the cape sea route jan van riebeeck established a victualing station at the cape of good hope at what would become cape town on behalf of the dutch east india company in time the cape become home to a large population of vrijlieden also known as vrijburgers free citizens former company employees who stayed in dutch territories overseas after serving their contracts dutch traders also imported thousands of slaves to the fledgling colony from indonesia madagascar and parts of eastern africa some of the earliest mixed race communities in the country were later formed through unions between vrijburgers their slaves and various indigenous peoples this led to the development of a new ethnic group the cape coloureds most of whom adopted the dutch language and christian faith the eastward expansion of dutch colonists ushered in a series of wars with the southwesterly migrating xhosa tribe as both sides competed for the pastureland necessary to graze their cattle near the great fish river vrijburgers who became independent farmers on the frontier were known as boers with some adopting seminomadic lifestyles being denoted as trekboers the boers formed loose militias which they termed commandos and forged alliances with khoisan groups to repel xhosa raids both sides launched bloody but inconclusive offensives and sporadic violence often accompanied by livestock theft remained common for several decades british colonisation great britain occupied cape town between  and  to prevent it from falling under the control of the french first republic which had invaded the low countries despite briefly returning to dutch rule under the batavian republic in  the cape was occupied again by the british in  following the end of the napoleonic wars it was formally ceded to great britain and became an integral part of the british empire british immigration to south africa began around  subsequently culminating in the arrival of the  settlers the new colonists were induced to settle for a variety of reasons namely to increase the size of the european workforce and to bolster frontier regions against xhosa incursions depiction of a zulu attack on a boer camp in february  in the first two decades of the th century the zulu people grew in power and expanded their territory under their leader shaka shakas warfare led indirectly to the mfecane crushing that devastated and depopulated the inland plateau in the early s an offshoot of the zulu the matabele people created a larger empire that included large parts of the highveld under their king mzilikazi during the early s many dutch settlers departed from the cape colony where they had been subjected to british control they migrated to the future natal orange free state and transvaal regions the boers founded the boer republics the south african republic now gauteng limpopo mpumalanga and north west provinces and the orange free state free state the discovery of diamonds in  and gold in  in the interior started the mineral revolution and increased economic growth and immigration this intensified british efforts to gain control over the indigenous peoples the struggle to control these important economic resources was a factor in relations between europeans and the indigenous population and also between the boers and the british the anglozulu war was fought in  between the british empire and the zulu kingdom following lord carnarvons successful introduction of federation in canada it was thought that similar political effort coupled with military campaigns might succeed with the african kingdoms tribal areas and boer republics in south africa in  sir henry bartle frere was sent to south africa as high commissioner for the british empire to bring such plans into being among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the south african republic and the kingdom of zululand and its army the zulu nation spectacularly defeated the british at the battle of isandlwana eventually though the war was lost resulting in the end of the zulu nations independence boers in combat  the boer republics successfully resisted british encroachments during the first boer war – using guerrilla warfare tactics which were well suited to local conditions the british returned with greater numbers more experience and new strategy in the second boer war – but suffered heavy casualties through attrition nonetheless they were ultimately successful independence within the country antibritish policies among white south africans focused on independence during the dutch and british colonial years racial segregation was mostly informal though some legislation was enacted to control the settlement and movement of native people including the native location act of  and the system of pass laws eight years after the end of the second boer war and after four years of negotiation an act of the british parliament south africa act  granted nominal independence while creating the union of south africa on  may  the union was a dominion that included the former territories of the cape and natal colonies as well as the republics of orange free state and transvaal the natives land act of  severely restricted the ownership of land by blacks at that stage natives controlled only  of the country the amount of land reserved for indigenous peoples was later marginally increased in  the union was fully sovereign from the united kingdom with the passage of the statute of westminster which abolished the last powers of the british government on the country in  the south african party and national party merged to form the united party seeking reconciliation between afrikaners and englishspeaking whites in  the party split over the entry of the union into world war ii as an ally of the united kingdom a move which the national party followers strongly opposed beginning of apartheid for use by white persons – apartheid sign in  the national party was elected to power it strengthened the racial segregation begun under dutch and british colonial rule the nationalist government classified all peoples into three races and developed rights and limitations for each the white minority less than  controlled the vastly larger black majority the legally institutionalised segregation became known as apartheid while whites enjoyed the highest standard of living in all of africa comparable to first world western nations the black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard including income education housing and life expectancy the freedom charter adopted in  by the congress alliance demanded a nonracial society and an end to discrimination republic on  may  the country became a republic following a referendum in which white voters narrowly voted in favour thereof the britishdominated natal province rallied against the issue queen elizabeth ii was stripped of the title queen of south africa and the last governorgeneral namely charles robberts swart became state president as a concession to the westminster system the presidency remained parliamentary appointed and virtually powerless until p w bothas constitution act of  which intact in these regards eliminated the office of prime minister and instated a nearunique strong presidency responsible to parliament pressured by other commonwealth of nations countries south africa withdrew from the organisation in  and rejoined it only in  despite opposition both within and outside the country the government legislated for a continuation of apartheid the security forces cracked down on internal dissent and violence became widespread with antiapartheid organisations such as the african national congress the azanian peoples organisation and the panafricanist congress carrying out guerrilla warfare and urban sabotage the three rival resistance movements also engaged in occasional interfactional clashes as they jockeyed for domestic influence apartheid became increasingly controversial and several countries began to boycott business with the south african government because of its racial policies these measures were later extended to international sanctions and the divestment of holdings by foreign investors f w de klerk and nelson mandela shake hands in january  in the late s south africa initiated a programme of nuclear weapons development in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons end of apartheid the mahlabatini declaration of faith signed by mangosuthu buthelezi and harry schwarz in  enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all the first of such agreements by black and white political leaders in south africa ultimately f w de klerk opened bilateral discussions with nelson mandela in  for a transition of policies and government in  the national party government took the first step towards dismantling discrimination when it lifted the ban on the african national congress and other political organisations it released nelson mandela from prison after twentyseven years serving a sentence for sabotage a negotiation process followed with approval from a predominantly white referendum the government repealed apartheid legislation south africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty south africa held its first universal elections in  which the anc won by an overwhelming majority it has been in power ever since the country rejoined the commonwealth of nations and became a member of the southern african development community sadc nelson mandela first black african president of republic of south africa in postapartheid south africa unemployment has been extremely high as the country has struggled with many changes while many blacks have risen to middle or upper classes the overall unemployment rate of blacks worsened between  and  poverty among whites previously rare increased in addition the current government has struggled to achieve the monetary and fiscal discipline to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth since the ancled government took power the united nations human development index of south africa has fallen while it was steadily rising until the mids some may be attributed to the hivaids pandemic and the failure of the government to take steps to address it in the early years in may  riots left over sixty people dead the centre on housing rights and evictions estimates over  people were driven from their homes the targets were mainly migrants and refugees seeking asylum but a third of the victims were south african citizens in a  survey the south african migration project concluded that south africans are more opposed to immigration than anywhere else in the world the united nations high commissioner for refugees in  reported over  refugees applied for asylum in south africa almost four times as many as the year before these people were mainly from zimbabwe though many also come from burundi democratic republic of the congo rwanda eritrea ethiopia and somalia competition over jobs business opportunities public services and housing has led to tension between refugees and host communities while xenophobia is still a problem recent violence has not been as widespread as initially feared geography main article geography of south africa a map of south africa showing the main topographic features the central plateau edged by the great escarpment and the cape fold belt in the southwest corner of the country important geographical regions in south africa the thick line traces the course of the great escarpment which edges the central plateau the eastern portion of this line coloured red is known as the drakensberg the escarpment rises to its highest point at over  m where the drakensberg forms the border between kwazulunatal and lesotho none of the regions indicated on the map has a sharp welldefined border except where the escarpment or a range of mountains forms a clear dividing line between two regions some of the better known regions are coloured in the others are simply indicated by their names as they would be in an atlas south africa is located at the southernmost region of africa with a long coastline that stretches more than  km  mi and along two oceans the south atlantic and the indian at  km  sq mi south africa is the thlargest country in the world and is comparable in size to colombia mafadi in the drakensberg at  m  ft is the highest peak in south africa excluding the prince edward islands the country lies between latitudes ° and °s and longitudes ° and °e the interior of south africa consists of a vast in most places almost flat plateau with an altitude of between  m  ft and  m  ft highest in the east and sloping gently downwards towards the west and north and slightly less noticeably so to the south and southwest this plateau is surrounded by the great escarpment whose eastern and highest stretch is known as the drakensberg the south and southwestern parts of the plateau at approximately – m above sea level and the adjoining plain below at approximately – m above sea level – see map on the right is known as the great karoo which consists of sparsely populated scrubland to the north the great karoo fades into the even drier and more arid bushmanland which eventually becomes the kalahari desert in the very northwest of the country the mideastern and highest part of the plateau is known as the highveld this relatively wellwatered area is home to a great proportion of the country’s commercial farmlands and contains its largest conurbation gauteng province to the north of highveld from about the °  s line of latitude the plateau slopes downwards into the bushveld which ultimately gives way to the limpopo lowlands or lowveld flat topped hills called karoo koppies are highly characteristic of the southern and southwestern karoo landscape these hills are capped by hard erosion resistant dolerite sills this is solidified lava that was forced under high pressure between the horizontal strata of the sedimentary rocks that make up most of the karoo’s geology about  million years ago since then southern africa has undergone a prolonged period of erosion removing the relatively soft karoo rocks except where they are protected by a cap of dolerite this photograph was taken near cradock in the eastern cape the coastal belt below the great escarpment moving clockwise from the northeast consists of the limpopo lowveld which merges into the mpumalanga lowveld below the mpumalanga drakensberg the eastern portion of the great escarpment this is hotter drier and less intensely cultivated than the highveld above the escarpment the kruger national park located in the provinces of limpopo and mpumalanga in northeastern south africa occupies a large portion of the lowveld covering  square kilometres  sq mi  south of the lowveld the annual rainfall increases as one enters kwazulunatal province which especially near the coast is subtropically hot and humid the kwazulunatal – lesotho international border is formed by the highest portion of the great escarpment or drakensberg which reaches an altitude of over  m  ft the climate at the foot of this part of the drakensberg is temperate drakensberg the eastern and highest portion of the great escarpment which surrounds the east south and western borders of the central plateau of southern africa the coastal belt below the south and southwestern stretches of the great escarpment contains several ranges of cape fold mountains which run parallel to the coast separating the great escarpment from the ocean these parallel ranges of fold mountains are shown on the map above left note the course of the great escarpment to the north of these mountain ranges the land at approximately – m above sea level between two of these ranges of fold mountains in the south ie between the outeniqua and langeberg ranges to the south and the swartberg range to the north is known as the little karoo which consists of semidesert scrubland similar to that of the great karoo except that its northern strip along the foothills of the swartberg mountains has a somewhat higher rainfall and is therefore more cultivated than the great karoo the little karoo is historically and still famous for its ostrich farming around the town of oudtshoorn the lowland area – m above sea level to the north of the swartberg mountain range up to the great escarpment is the lowland part of the great karoo see map at top right which is climatically and botanically almost indistinguishable from the karoo above the great escarpment the narrow coastal strip between the most seaward cape fold mountain range ie the langeberg–outeniqua mountains and the ocean has a moderately high yearround rainfall especially in the georgeknysnaplettenberg bay region which is known as the garden route it is famous for the most extensive areas of indigenous forests in south africa a generally forestpoor country in the southwest corner of the country the cape peninsula forms the southernmost tip of the coastal strip which borders the atlantic ocean and ultimately terminates at the country’s border with namibia at the orange river the cape peninsula has a mediterranean climate making it and its immediate surrounds the only portion of africa south of the sahara which receives most of its rainfall in winter the greater cape town metropolitan area is situated on the cape peninsula and is home to  million people according to the  population census it is the countrys legislative capital spring flowers in namaqualand the coastal belt to the north of the cape peninsula is bounded on the west by the atlantic ocean and the first row of northsouth running cape fold mountains to the east the cape fold mountains peter out at about the ° s line of latitude after which the coastal plain is bounded by the great escarpment itself the most southerly portion of this coastal belt is known as the swartland and malmesbury plain which is an important wheat growing region relying on winter rains the region further north is known as namaqualand which becomes more and more arid as one approaches the orange river the little rain that falls tends to fall in winter which results in one of the world’s most spectacular displays of flowers carpeting huge stretches of veld in spring august–september cape floral region protected areas south africa also has one possession the small subantarctic archipelago of the prince edward islands consisting of marion island  km or  sq mi and prince edward island  km or  sq mi not to be confused with the canadian province of the same name climate main article climate of south africa köppen climate types of south africa south africa has a generally temperate climate due in part to being surrounded by the atlantic and indian oceans on three sides by its location in the climatically milder southern hemisphere and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north towards the equator and further inland due to this varied topography and oceanic influence a great variety of climatic zones exist the climatic zones range from the extreme desert of the southern namib in the farthest northwest to the lush subtropical climate in the east along the mozambique border and the indian ocean winters in south africa occur between june and august the extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the mediterranean with wet winters and hot dry summers hosting the famous fynbos biome of shrubland and thicket this area also produces much of the wine in south africa this region is also particularly known for its wind which blows intermittently almost all year the severity of this wind made passing around the cape of good hope particularly treacherous for sailors causing many shipwrecks further east on the south coast rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year producing a green landscape this area is popularly known as the garden route the free state is particularly flat because it lies centrally on the high plateau north of the vaal river the highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat johannesburg in the centre of the highveld is at  m  ft and receives an annual rainfall of  mm  in winters in this region are cold although snow is rare the high drakensberg mountains which form the southeastern escarpment of the highveld offer limited skiing opportunities in winter the coldest place on mainland south africa is sutherland in the western roggeveld mountains where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as − °c  °f the prince edward islands have colder average annual temperatures but sutherland has colder extremes the deep interior of mainland south africa has the hottest temperatures a temperature of  °c  °f was recorded in  in the northern cape kalahari near upington but this temperature is unofficial and was not recorded with standard equipment the official highest temperature is  °c  °f at vioolsdrif in january  biodiversity

animals south african giraffe kruger national park numerous mammals are found in the bushveld including transvaal lions african leopards south african cheetahs southern white rhinos blue wildebeest kudus impalas hyenas hippopotamuses and south african giraffes a significant extent of the bushveld exists in the northeast including kruger national park and the sabi sand game reserve as well as in

species of fungi including lichenforming species had been recorded in  the total number of fungi which occur in south africa was conservatively estimated at about  species but that did not take into account fungi associated with insects if correct then the number of south african fungi dwarfs that of its plants in at least some major south african ecosystems an exceptionally high percentage of fungi are highly specific in terms of the plants with which they occur the countrys biodiversity strategy and action plan does not mention fungi including lichenforming fungi plants subtropical forest near durban lowveld vegetation of the kruger national park with more than  different higher plants or about  of all the known species of plants on earth south africa is particularly rich in plant diversity the most prevalent biome in south africa is the grassland particularly on the highveld where the plant cover is dominated by different grasses low shrubs and acacia trees mainly camelthorn and whitethorn vegetation becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low rainfall there are several species of waterstoring succulents like aloes and euphorbias in the very hot and dry

the world extensive fossil remains have been recovered from a series of caves in gauteng province the area is a unesco world heritage site and has been termed the cradle of humankind the sites include sterkfontein which is one of the richest hominin fossil sites in the world other sites include swartkrans gondolin cave kromdraai coopers cave and malapa the first hominin fossil discovered in africa the taung child was found near taung in  further hominin remains have been recovered from the sites of makapansgat in limpopo cornelia and florisbad in the free state border cave in kwazulunatal klasies river mouth in eastern cape and pinnacle point elandsfontein and die kelders cave in western cape these sites suggest that various hominid species existed in south africa from about three million years ago starting with australopithecus africanus these were succeeded by various species including australopithecus sediba homo ergaster homo erectus homo rhodesiensis homo helmei homo

cape colony and dutch cape colony charles davidson bells thcentury painting of jan van riebeeck who founded the first european settlement in south africa arrives in table bay in  by the early th century portugals maritime power was starting to decline and english and dutch merchants competed to oust lisbon from its lucrative monopoly on the spice trade representatives of the british east india company did call sporadically at the cape in search of provisions as early as  but later came to favour ascension island and st helena as alternative ports of refuge dutch interest was aroused after  when two employees of the dutch east india company voc were shipwrecked there for several months the sailors were able to survive by obtaining fresh water and meat from the natives they also sowed vegetables in the fertile soil upon their return to holland they reported favourably on the capes potential as a warehouse and garden for provisions to stock passing ships for long voyages in  a century and a half after the discovery of the cape sea route jan van riebeeck established a victualing station at the cape of good hope at what would become cape town on behalf of the dutch east india company in time the cape become home to a large population of vrijlieden also known as vrijburgers free citizens former company employees who stayed in dutch territories overseas after serving their contracts dutch traders also imported thousands of slaves to the fledgling colony from indonesia madagascar and parts of eastern africa some of the earliest mixed race communities in the country were later formed through unions between vrijburgers their slaves and various indigenous peoples this led to the development of a new ethnic group the cape coloureds most of whom adopted the dutch language and christian faith the eastward expansion of dutch colonists ushered in a series of wars with the southwesterly migrating xhosa tribe as both sides competed for the pastureland necessary to graze their cattle near the great fish river vrijburgers who became independent farmers on the frontier were known as boers with some adopting seminomadic lifestyles being denoted as trekboers the boers formed loose militias which they termed commandos and forged alliances with khoisan groups to repel xhosa raids both sides launched bloody but inconclusive offensives and sporadic violence often accompanied by livestock theft remained common for several decades british colonisation great britain occupied cape town between  and  to prevent it from falling under the control of the french first republic which had invaded the low countries despite briefly returning to dutch rule under the batavian republic in  the cape was occupied again by the british in  following the end of the napoleonic wars it was formally ceded to great britain and became an integral part of the british empire british immigration to south africa began around  subsequently culminating in the arrival of the  settlers the new colonists were induced to settle for a variety of reasons namely to increase the size of the european workforce and to bolster frontier regions against xhosa incursions depiction of a zulu attack on a boer camp in february  in the first two decades of the th century the zulu people grew in power and expanded their territory under their leader shaka shakas warfare led indirectly to the mfecane crushing that devastated and depopulated the inland plateau in the early s an offshoot of the zulu the matabele people created a larger empire that included large parts of the highveld under their king mzilikazi during the early s many dutch settlers departed from the cape colony where they had been subjected to british control they migrated to the future natal orange free state and transvaal regions the boers founded the boer republics the south african republic now gauteng limpopo mpumalanga and north west provinces and the orange free state free state the discovery of diamonds in  and gold in  in the interior started the mineral revolution and increased economic growth and immigration this intensified british efforts to gain control over the indigenous peoples the struggle to control these important economic resources was a factor in relations between europeans and the indigenous population and also between the boers and the british the anglozulu war was fought in  between the british empire and the zulu kingdom following lord carnarvons successful introduction of federation in canada it was thought that similar political effort coupled with military campaigns might succeed with the african kingdoms tribal areas and boer republics in south africa in  sir henry bartle frere was sent to south africa as high commissioner for the british empire to bring such plans into being among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the south african republic and the kingdom of zululand and its army the zulu nation spectacularly defeated the british at the battle of isandlwana eventually though the war was lost resulting in the end of the zulu nations independence boers in combat  the boer republics successfully resisted british encroachments during the first boer war – using guerrilla warfare tactics which were well suited to local conditions the british returned with greater numbers more experience and new strategy in the second boer war – but suffered heavy casualties through attrition nonetheless they were ultimately successful independence within the country antibritish policies among white south africans focused on independence during the dutch and british colonial years racial segregation was mostly informal though some legislation was enacted to control the settlement and movement of native people including the native location act of  and the system of pass laws eight years after the end of the second boer war and after four years of negotiation an act of the british parliament south africa act  granted nominal independence while creating the union of south africa on  may  the union was a dominion that included the former territories of the cape and natal colonies as well as the republics of orange free state and transvaal the natives land act of  severely restricted the ownership of land by blacks at that stage natives controlled only  of the country the amount of land reserved for indigenous peoples was later marginally increased in  the union was fully sovereign from the united kingdom with the passage of the statute of westminster which abolished the last powers of the british

the entry of the union into world war ii as an ally of the united kingdom a move which the national party followers strongly opposed beginning of apartheid for use by white persons – apartheid sign in  the national party was elected to power it strengthened the racial segregation begun under dutch and british colonial rule the nationalist government classified all peoples into three races and developed rights and limitations for each the white minority less than  controlled the vastly larger black majority the legally institutionalised segregation became known as apartheid while whites enjoyed the highest standard of living in all of africa comparable to first world western nations the black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard including income education housing and life expectancy the freedom charter adopted in  by the congress alliance demanded a nonracial society and an end to discrimination republic on  may  the country became a republic following a referendum in which white voters narrowly voted in favour thereof the britishdominated natal province rallied against the issue queen elizabeth ii was stripped of the title queen of south africa and the last governorgeneral namely charles robberts swart became state president as a concession to the westminster system the presidency remained parliamentary appointed and virtually powerless until p w bothas constitution act of  which intact in these regards eliminated the office of prime minister and instated a nearunique strong presidency responsible to parliament pressured by other commonwealth of nations countries south africa withdrew from the organisation in  and rejoined it only in  despite opposition both within and outside the country the government legislated for a continuation of apartheid the security forces cracked down on internal dissent and violence became widespread with antiapartheid organisations such as the african national congress the azanian peoples organisation and the panafricanist congress carrying out guerrilla warfare and urban sabotage the three rival resistance movements also engaged in occasional interfactional clashes as they jockeyed for domestic influence apartheid became increasingly controversial and several countries began to boycott business with the south african government because of its racial policies these measures were later extended to international sanctions and the divestment of holdings by foreign investors f w de klerk and nelson mandela shake hands in january  in the late s south africa initiated a programme of nuclear weapons development in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons end of apartheid the mahlabatini declaration of faith signed by mangosuthu buthelezi and harry schwarz in  enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all the first of such agreements by black and white political leaders in south africa ultimately f w de klerk opened bilateral discussions with nelson mandela in  for a transition of policies and government in  the national party government took the first step towards dismantling discrimination when it lifted the ban on the african national congress and other political organisations it released nelson mandela from prison after twentyseven years serving a sentence for sabotage a negotiation process followed with approval from a predominantly white referendum the government repealed apartheid legislation south africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty

country has struggled with many changes while many blacks have risen to middle or upper classes the overall unemployment rate of blacks worsened between  and  poverty among whites previously rare increased in addition the current government has struggled to achieve the monetary and fiscal discipline to ensure both redistribution of wealth and economic growth since the ancled government took power the united nations human development index of south africa has fallen while it was steadily rising until the mids some may be attributed to the hivaids pandemic and the failure of the government to take steps to address it in the early years in may  riots left over sixty people dead the centre on housing rights and evictions estimates over  people were driven from their homes the targets were mainly migrants and refugees seeking asylum but a third of the victims were south african citizens in a  survey the south african migration project concluded that south africans are more opposed to immigration than anywhere else in the world the united nations high commissioner for refugees in  reported over  refugees applied for asylum in south africa almost four times as many as the year before these people were mainly from zimbabwe though many also come from burundi democratic republic of the congo rwanda eritrea ethiopia and somalia competition over jobs business opportunities public services and housing has led to tension between refugees and host communities while xenophobia is still a problem recent violence has not been as widespread as initially feared geography main article geography of south africa a map of south africa showing the main topographic features the central plateau edged by the great escarpment and the cape fold belt in the southwest corner of the country important geographical regions in south africa the thick line traces the course of the great escarpment which edges the central plateau the eastern portion of this line coloured red is known as the drakensberg the escarpment rises to its highest point at over  m where the drakensberg forms the border between kwazulunatal and lesotho none of the regions indicated on the map has a sharp welldefined border except where the escarpment or a range of mountains forms a clear dividing line between two regions some of the better known regions are coloured in the others are simply indicated

the prince edward islands the country lies between latitudes ° and °s and longitudes ° and °e the interior of south africa consists of a vast in most places almost flat plateau with an altitude of between  m  ft and  m  ft highest in the east and sloping gently downwards towards the west and north and slightly less noticeably so to the south and southwest this plateau is surrounded by the great escarpment whose eastern and highest stretch is known as the drakensberg the south and southwestern parts of the plateau at approximately – m above sea level and the adjoining plain below at approximately – m above sea level – see map on the right is known as the great karoo which consists of sparsely populated scrubland to the north the great karoo fades into the even drier and more arid bushmanland which eventually becomes the kalahari desert in the very northwest of the country the mideastern and highest part of the plateau is known as the highveld this relatively wellwatered area is home to a great proportion of the country’s commercial farmlands and contains its largest conurbation gauteng province to the north of highveld from about the °  s line of latitude the plateau slopes downwards into the bushveld which ultimately gives way to the limpopo lowlands or lowveld flat topped hills called karoo koppies are highly characteristic of the southern and southwestern karoo landscape these hills are capped by hard erosion resistant dolerite sills this is solidified lava that was forced under high pressure between the horizontal strata of the sedimentary rocks that make up most of the karoo’s geology about  million years ago since then southern africa has undergone a prolonged period of erosion removing the relatively soft karoo rocks except where they are protected by a cap of dolerite this photograph was taken near cradock in the eastern cape the coastal belt below the great escarpment moving clockwise from the northeast consists of the limpopo lowveld which merges into the mpumalanga lowveld below the mpumalanga drakensberg the eastern portion of the great escarpment this is hotter drier and less intensely cultivated than the highveld above the escarpment the kruger national park located in the provinces of limpopo and mpumalanga in northeastern south africa occupies a large portion of the lowveld covering  square kilometres  sq mi  south of the lowveld the annual rainfall increases as one enters kwazulunatal province which especially near the coast is subtropically hot and humid the kwazulunatal – lesotho international border is formed by the highest portion of the great escarpment or drakensberg which reaches an altitude of over  m  ft the climate at the foot of this part of the drakensberg is temperate drakensberg the eastern and highest portion of the great escarpment which surrounds the east south and western borders of the central plateau of southern africa the coastal belt below the south and southwestern stretches of the great escarpment contains several ranges of cape fold mountains which run parallel to the coast separating the great escarpment from the ocean these parallel ranges of fold mountains are shown on the map above left note the course of the great escarpment to the north of these mountain ranges the land at approximately – m above sea level between two of these ranges of fold mountains in the south ie between the outeniqua and langeberg ranges to the south and the swartberg range to the north is known as the little karoo which consists of semidesert scrubland similar to that of the great karoo except that its northern strip along the foothills of the swartberg mountains has a somewhat higher rainfall and is therefore more cultivated than the great karoo the little karoo is historically and still famous for its ostrich farming around the town of oudtshoorn the lowland area – m above sea level to the north of the swartberg mountain range up to the great escarpment is the lowland part of the great karoo see map at top right which is climatically and botanically almost indistinguishable from the karoo above the great escarpment the narrow coastal strip between the most seaward cape fold mountain range ie the langeberg–outeniqua mountains and the ocean has a moderately high yearround rainfall especially in the georgeknysnaplettenberg bay region which is known as the garden route it is famous for the most extensive areas of indigenous forests in south africa a generally forestpoor country in the southwest corner of the country the cape peninsula forms the southernmost tip of

article climate of south africa köppen climate types of south africa south africa has a generally temperate climate due in part to being surrounded by the atlantic and indian oceans on three sides by its location in the climatically milder southern hemisphere and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north towards the equator and further inland due to this varied topography and oceanic influence a great variety of climatic zones exist the climatic zones range from the extreme desert of the southern namib in the farthest northwest to the lush subtropical climate in the east along the mozambique border and the indian ocean winters in south africa occur between june and august the extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the mediterranean with wet winters and hot dry summers hosting the famous fynbos biome of shrubland and thicket this area also produces much of the wine in south africa this region is also particularly known for its wind which blows intermittently almost all year the severity of this wind made passing around the cape of good hope particularly treacherous for sailors causing many shipwrecks further east on the south coast rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year producing a green landscape this area is popularly known as the garden route the free state is particularly flat because it lies centrally on the high plateau north of the vaal river the highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat johannesburg in the centre of the highveld is at  m  ft and receives an annual rainfall of  mm  in winters in this region are cold although snow is rare the high drakensberg mountains which form the southeastern escarpment of the highveld offer limited skiing opportunities in winter the coldest place on mainland south africa is sutherland in the western roggeveld mountains where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as − °c  °f the prince edward islands have colder average annual temperatures but sutherland has colder extremes the deep interior of mainland south africa has the hottest temperatures a temperature of  °c  °f was recorded in  in the

india company did call sporadically at the cape in search of provisions as early as  but later came to favour ascension island and st helena as alternative ports of refuge dutch interest was aroused after  when two employees of the dutch east india company voc were shipwrecked there for several months the sailors were able to survive by obtaining fresh water and meat from the natives they also sowed vegetables in the fertile soil upon their return to holland they reported favourably on the capes potential as a warehouse and garden for provisions to stock passing ships for long voyages in  a century and a half after the discovery of the cape sea route jan van riebeeck established a victualing station at the cape of good hope at what would become cape town on behalf of the dutch east india company in time the cape become home to a large population of vrijlieden also known as vrijburgers free citizens former company employees who stayed in dutch territories overseas after serving their contracts dutch traders also imported thousands of slaves to the fledgling colony from indonesia madagascar and parts of eastern africa some of the earliest mixed race communities in the country were later formed through unions between vrijburgers their slaves and various indigenous peoples this led to the development of a new ethnic group the cape coloureds most of whom adopted the dutch language and christian faith the eastward expansion of dutch colonists ushered in a series of wars with the southwesterly migrating xhosa tribe as both sides competed for the pastureland necessary to graze their cattle near the great fish river vrijburgers who became independent farmers on the frontier were known as boers with some adopting seminomadic lifestyles being denoted as trekboers the boers formed loose militias which they termed commandos and forged alliances with khoisan groups to repel xhosa raids both sides launched bloody but inconclusive offensives and sporadic violence often accompanied by livestock theft remained common for several decades british colonisation great britain occupied cape town between  and  to prevent it from falling under the control of the french first republic which had invaded the low countries despite briefly returning to dutch rule under the batavian republic in  the cape was occupied again by the british in  following the end of the napoleonic wars it was formally ceded to great britain and became an integral part of the british empire british immigration to south africa began around  subsequently culminating in the arrival of the  settlers the new colonists were induced to settle for a variety of reasons namely to increase the size of the european workforce and to bolster frontier regions against xhosa incursions depiction of a zulu attack on a boer camp in february  in the first two decades of the th century the zulu people grew in power and expanded their territory under their leader shaka shakas warfare led indirectly to the mfecane crushing that devastated and depopulated the inland plateau in the early s an offshoot of the zulu the matabele people created a larger empire that included large parts of the highveld under their king mzilikazi during the early s many dutch settlers departed from the cape colony where they had been subjected to british control they migrated to the future natal orange free state and transvaal regions the boers founded the boer republics the south african republic now gauteng limpopo mpumalanga and north west provinces and the orange free state free state the discovery of diamonds in  and gold in  in the interior started the mineral revolution and increased economic growth and immigration this intensified british efforts to gain control over the indigenous peoples the struggle to control these important economic resources was a factor in relations between europeans and the indigenous population and also between the boers and the british the anglozulu war was fought in  between the british empire and the zulu kingdom following lord carnarvons successful introduction of federation in canada it was thought that similar political effort coupled with military campaigns might succeed with the african kingdoms tribal areas and boer republics in south africa in  sir henry bartle frere was sent to south africa as high commissioner for the british empire to bring such plans into being among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the south african republic and the kingdom of zululand and its army the zulu nation spectacularly defeated the british at the battle of isandlwana eventually though the war was lost resulting in the end of the zulu nations independence boers in combat  the boer republics successfully resisted british encroachments during the first boer war – using guerrilla warfare tactics which were well suited to local conditions the british returned with greater numbers more experience and new strategy in the second boer war – but suffered heavy casualties through attrition nonetheless they were ultimately successful independence within the country antibritish policies among white south africans focused on independence during the dutch and british colonial years racial segregation was mostly informal though some legislation was enacted to control the settlement and movement of native people including the native location act of  and the system of pass laws eight years after the end of the second boer war and after four years of negotiation an act of the british parliament south africa act  granted

developed rights and limitations for each the white minority less than  controlled the vastly larger black majority the legally institutionalised segregation became known as apartheid while whites enjoyed the highest standard of living in all of africa comparable to first world western nations the black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard including income education housing and life expectancy the freedom charter adopted in  by the congress alliance demanded a nonracial society and an end to discrimination republic on  may  the country became a republic following a referendum in which white voters narrowly voted in favour thereof the britishdominated natal province rallied against the issue queen elizabeth ii was stripped of the title queen of south africa and the last governorgeneral namely charles robberts swart became state president as a concession to the westminster system the presidency remained parliamentary appointed and virtually powerless until p

commonwealth of nations countries south africa withdrew from the organisation in  and rejoined it only in  despite opposition both within and outside the country the government legislated for a continuation of apartheid the security forces cracked down on internal dissent and violence became widespread with antiapartheid organisations such as the african national congress the azanian peoples organisation and the panafricanist congress carrying out guerrilla warfare and urban sabotage the three rival resistance movements also engaged in occasional interfactional clashes as they jockeyed for domestic influence apartheid became increasingly controversial and several countries began to boycott business with the south african government because of its racial policies these measures were later extended to international sanctions and the divestment of holdings by foreign investors f w de klerk and nelson mandela shake hands in january  in the late s south africa initiated a programme of nuclear weapons development in the following decade it produced six deliverable nuclear weapons end of apartheid the mahlabatini declaration of faith signed by mangosuthu buthelezi and harry

the ban on the african national congress and other political organisations it released nelson mandela from prison after twentyseven years serving a sentence for sabotage a negotiation process followed with approval from a predominantly white referendum the government repealed apartheid legislation south africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty

escarpment whose eastern and highest stretch is known as the drakensberg the south and southwestern parts of the plateau at approximately – m above sea level and the adjoining plain below at approximately – m above sea level – see map on the right is known as the great karoo which consists of sparsely populated scrubland to the north the great karoo fades into the even drier and more arid bushmanland which eventually becomes the kalahari desert in the very northwest of the country the mideastern and highest part of the plateau is known as the highveld this relatively wellwatered area is home to a great proportion of the country’s commercial farmlands and contains its largest conurbation gauteng province to the north of highveld from about the °  s line of latitude the plateau slopes downwards into the bushveld which ultimately gives way to the limpopo lowlands or lowveld flat topped hills called karoo koppies are highly characteristic of the southern and southwestern karoo landscape these hills are capped by hard erosion resistant dolerite sills this is solidified lava that was forced under high pressure between the horizontal strata of the sedimentary rocks that make up most of the karoo’s geology about  million years ago since then southern africa has undergone a prolonged period of erosion removing the relatively soft karoo rocks except where they are protected by a cap of dolerite this photograph was taken near cradock in the eastern cape the coastal belt below the great escarpment moving clockwise from the northeast consists of the limpopo lowveld which merges into the mpumalanga lowveld below the mpumalanga drakensberg the eastern portion of the great escarpment this is hotter drier and less intensely cultivated than the highveld above the escarpment the kruger national park located in the provinces of limpopo and mpumalanga in northeastern south africa occupies a large portion of the lowveld covering  square kilometres  sq mi  south of the lowveld the annual rainfall increases as one enters kwazulunatal province which especially near the coast is subtropically hot and humid the kwazulunatal – lesotho international border is formed by the highest portion of the great escarpment or drakensberg which reaches an altitude of over  m  ft the climate at the foot of this part of the drakensberg is temperate drakensberg the eastern and highest portion of the great escarpment which surrounds the east south and western borders of the central plateau of southern africa the coastal belt below the south and southwestern stretches of the

between the outeniqua and langeberg ranges to the south and the swartberg range to the north is known as the little karoo which consists of semidesert scrubland similar to that of the great karoo except that its northern strip along the foothills of the swartberg mountains has a somewhat higher rainfall and is therefore more cultivated than the great karoo the little karoo is historically and still famous for its ostrich farming around the town of oudtshoorn the lowland area – m above sea level to the north of the swartberg mountain range up to the great escarpment is the lowland part of

article climate of south africa köppen climate types of south africa south africa has a generally temperate climate due in part to being surrounded by the atlantic and indian oceans on three sides by its location in the climatically milder southern hemisphere and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north towards the equator and further inland due to this varied topography and oceanic influence a great variety of climatic zones exist the climatic zones range from the extreme desert of the southern namib in the farthest northwest to the lush subtropical climate in the east along the mozambique border and the indian ocean winters in south africa occur between june and august the extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the mediterranean with wet winters and hot dry summers hosting the famous fynbos biome of shrubland and thicket this area also produces much of the wine in south africa this region is also particularly known for its wind which blows intermittently almost all year the severity of this wind made passing around the cape of good hope particularly treacherous for sailors causing many shipwrecks further east on the south coast rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year producing a green landscape this area is popularly known as the garden route the free state is particularly flat because it lies centrally on

africa south africa introduction  south africa background dutch traders landed at the southern tip of modern day south africa in  and established a stopover point on the spice route between the netherlands and the far east founding the city of cape town after the british seized the cape of good hope area in  many of the dutch settlers afrikaners called boers farmers by the british trekked north to found their own republics transvaal and orange free state the discovery of diamonds  and gold  spurred wealth and immigration and intensified the subjugation of the native inhabitants the afrikaners resisted british encroachments but were defeated in the second south african war  however the british and the afrikaners ruled together beginning in  under the union of south africa which became a republic in  after a whitesonly referendum in  the afrikanerdominated national party was voted into power and instituted a policy of apartheid  the separate development of the races  which favored the white minority at the expense of the black majority the african national congress anc led the opposition to apartheid and many top anc leaders such as nelson mandela spent decades in south africas prisons internal protests and insurgency as well as boycotts by some western nations and institutions led to the regimes eventual willingness to negotiate a peaceful transition to majority rule the first multiracial elections in  following the end of apartheid ushered in majority rule under an ancled government south africa has since struggled to address apartheidera imbalances in decent housing education and health care anc infighting came to a head in  when president thabo mbeki was recalled by parliament and deputy president kgalema motlanthe succeeded him as interim

declined dramatically from about  children per woman in the s to roughly  in  this pattern is similar to fertility trends in south asia the middle east and north africa and sets south africa apart from the rest of subsaharan africa where the average tfr remains higher than other regions of the world today south africa’s decreasing number of reproductive age women is having fewer children as women increase their educational attainment workforce participation and use of family planning methods delay marriage and opt for smaller families as the proportion of workingage south africans has grown relative to children and the elderly south africa has been unable to achieve a demographic dividend because persistent high unemployment and the prevalence of hivaids have created a largerthannormal dependent population hivaids was also responsible for south africa’s average life expectancy plunging to less than  years in  it had only rebounded to approximately  years as of  hivaids continues to be a serious public health threat although awarenessraising campaigns and the wider availability of antiretroviral drugs is stabilizing the number of new cases enabling infected individuals to live longer healthier lives and reducing motherchild transmissions migration to south africa began in the second half of the th century when traders from the dutch east india company settled in the cape and started using slaves from south and southeast asia mainly from india but also from presentday indonesia bangladesh sri lanka and malaysia and southeast africa madagascar and mozambique as farm laborers and to a lesser extent as domestic servants the indian subcontinent remained the cape colony’s main source of slaves in the early th century while slaves were increasingly obtained from southeast africa in the latter part of the th century and into the th century under british rule after slavery was completely abolished in the british empire in  south africa’s colonists turned to temporary african migrants and indentured labor through agreements with india and later china countries that were anxious to export workers to alleviate domestic poverty and overpopulation of the more than  indentured indian laborers hired to work in natal’s sugar plantations between  and  most exercised the right as british subjects to remain permanently a small number of indian immigrants came freely as merchants because of growing resentment toward indian workers the  indentured chinese workers who mined gold in transvaal between  and  were under more restrictive contracts and generally were forced to return to their homeland in the late th century and nearly the entire th century south africa’s then british colonies’ and dutch states’ enforced selective immigration policies that welcomed “assimilable” white europeans as permanent residents but excluded or restricted other immigrants following the union of south africa’s passage of a law in  prohibiting asian and other nonwhite immigrants and its elimination of the indenture system in  temporary african contract laborers from neighboring countries became the dominant source of labor in the burgeoning mining industries others worked in agriculture and smaller numbers in manufacturing domestic service transportation and construction throughout the th century at least  of south africa’s miners were foreigners the numbers peaked at over  in the late s mozambique lesotho botswana and swaziland were the primary sources of miners and malawi and zimbabwe were periodic suppliers under apartheid a “two gates” migration policy focused on policing and deporting illegal migrants rather than on managing migration to meet south africa’s development needs the exclusionary  aliens control act limited labor recruitment to the highly skilled as defined by the ruling white minority while bilateral labor agreements provided exemptions that enabled the influential mining industry and to a lesser extent commercial farms to hire temporary lowpaid workers from neighboring states illegal african migrants were often tacitly allowed to work for low pay in other sectors but were always under threat of deportation the abolishment of apartheid in  led to the development of a new inclusive national identity and the strengthening of the country’s restrictive immigration policy despite south africa’s protectionist approach to immigration the downsizing and closing of mines and rising unemployment migrants from across the continent believed that the country held work opportunities fewer african labor migrants were issued temporary work permits and instead increasingly entered south africa with visitors’ permits or came illegally which drove growth in crossborder trade and the informal job market a new wave of asian immigrants has also arrived over the last two decades many operating small retail businesses in the postapartheid period increasing numbers of highly skilled white workers emigrated citing dissatisfaction with the political situation crime poor services and a reduced quality of life the  immigration act and later amendments were intended to facilitate the temporary migration of skilled foreign labor to fill labor shortages but instead the legislation continues to create regulatory obstacles although the education system has improved and brain drain has slowed in the wake of the  global financial crisis south africa continues to face skills shortages in several key sectors such as health care and technology south africa’s stability and economic growth has acted as a magnet for refugees and asylum seekers from nearby countries despite the prevalence of discrimination and xenophobic violence refugees have included an estimated  mozambicans during its s
