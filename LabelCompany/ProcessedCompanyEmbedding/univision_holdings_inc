univision holdings filed for an initial public offering of up to  million last week with plans to list under the ticker symbol “uvn” on either the new york stock exchange or the nasdaq global market the deal will mark a partial exit at the least for its owners privateequity firms madison dearborn partners providence equity partners tpg and thomas h lee partners as well as media mogul haim saban the group that acquired the company in  for  billion including debt the deal was financed with a stunning  billion of debt landing the company with a debttoebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ratio of  times ranking with the loftiest of the leveragedbuyout era the company has struggled under that debt load ever since univision operates the biggest portfolio of spanishlanguage media platforms in the us with broadcast and cable networks  local tv stations radio digital and mobile properties according to its prospectus it reaches more than  million media consumers every month tapping a demographic that is showing strong growth and increasing economic and political influence as the us heads into an election year there were  million hispanic people in the us as of december  a number that is expected to grow to  million by  according to the prospectus the community had an aggregate estimated buying power of  trillion as of  a number forecast to expand to  trillion by  it’s also the youngest demographic with  of hispanics below the age of  as of june  it has a registeredvoter base of  million or about  of the total voter base as of march  the prospectus makes no mention of donald trump’s  million lawsuit filed last week alleging breach of contract and defamation after the broadcaster pulled out of airing the miss usa pageant also read fellow republican presidential candidates distance themselves from donald trump after mexico immigration remarks univision has just extended its programming agreement with mexico’s grupa televisa sab

bank here are  things to know about univision before its ipo it is highly indebted as outlined above univision is grappling with a sizable debt burden much of which was taken on by its owners to finance their buyout of the company in  univision had total outstanding debt of  billion as of march  in the form of bank loans bonds and senior secured credit facilities the company is planning to use the proceeds of the ipo to reduce its debt which could become unmanageable if it were to experience net losses for a prolonged period or if any of its lenders were to withdraw a financing commitment according to its prospectus it isn’t profitable univision posted a net loss of  million for the three months ending march  after a small profit of  million in the yearearlier period the company eked out a  million profit for all of  after a  million profit for  but it was unprofitable for the three preceding years according to the prospectus revenue totaled  billion in  its audience may shrink over time as a service primarily targeting hispanics univision is exposed to a range of factors affecting that community including any federal or state legislation that curbs immigration from latin america into the us as long as new immigrants enter the country the network has a natural audience for its programming however as later generations become bilingual “demand for our spanishlanguage programming could be adversely impacted by competing englishlanguage programming including programming primarily in english that targets the bilingual us hispanic population” said the prospectus “ in addition a shift in policy towards encouraging englishlanguage fluency among us hispanic immigrants could also impact demand for spanishlanguage programming” it is highly exposed to televisa univision receives the bulk of its programming from televisa but the two parties havent always had a harmonious relationship televisa accused univision of failing to even consider its counterbid in  according to a wall street journal report and threatened to pull its programming and offer it to other outlets televisa will own a roughly  stake of univision’s voting rights if the ipo is completed after purchasing a  stake in  and exchanging  billion in notes for warrants that convert into common stock “the loss or decline in popularity of programming from televisa could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations” according to the prospectus it will not pay dividends any time soon as a holding company univision relies on dividends distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations that means its ability to pay dividends on its common stock will be dependent on the transfers from its subsidiaries — but the amount it can use for dividends is limited by their debt agreements as a result the company isnt planning to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future which means a

this offering by  million assuming the number of shares offered by us as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus remains the same and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses payable by us our media networks business is highly competitive competition for advertising revenues is based on the size of the market that the particular medium can reach the cost of such advertising and the effectiveness of such medium our television business competes for viewers and revenues with other spanishlanguage and englishlanguage television stations and networks including five englishlanguage broadcast television networks abc cbs nbc fox and cw and four spanishlanguage broadcast television networks tel etv aza and mmx as well as  dailymeasured adsupported cable networks many of these competitors are owned by companies much larger than us additionally some englishlanguage networks are producing spanishlanguage programming and simulcasting certain programming in english and spanish several mvpds offer spanishlanguage programming options as well our television affiliates located near the mexican border also compete for viewers with television stations operated in mexico many of which are affiliated with a televisa network and are owned by televisa but outside of our exclusivity rights the television broadcasting industry is subject to competition from videoondemand dvd and bluray players other personal video systems and fragmentation of viewership driven by the ever expanding cablenetwork landscape additionally consumers continue to change viewing habits increasingly gravitating towards wireless devices eg smartphones and tablets live streaming of shortform and longform content from the internet and online video services our broadcast cable and digital networks compete with pay content providers such as netflix amazon and hulu and free content providers such as youtube and facebook we attribute our large television audience to the size and growth of the us hispanic population the quality of our programming and the quality and experience of our management telemundo a subsidiary of nbc a division of comcast corporation is our largest television competitor that broadcasts spanishlanguage television programming in most of our dmas our affiliates compete for advertising dollars directly with a station owned by or affiliated with telemundo as well as with other spanishlanguage and englishlanguage stations our digital properties face various competitors including websites such as facebook youtube google telemundocom yahoo en español msn latino maximumtv butacatv vice vox media business insider time inc conde nast digital mashable the new york times the huffington post buzzfeed and mobile applications we also compete for online advertising dollars with social media providers such as facebook and twitter search engines such as google yahoo or bing and other websites our radio business competes for audiences and advertising revenues with other radio stations of all formats iheart media formerly clear channel the largest radio operator in the us cbs radio spanish broadcasting system liberman broadcasting and entravision are our largest radio competitors that broadcast spanishlanguage radio programming in several of our dmas additionally we face competition from englishlanguage stations that offer programming targeting hispanic audiences iheart radio converted several stations to hispanic targeted formats and has established a hispanic radio division creating its own iheart hispanic radio network spanish broadcasting systems’ aire radio networks syndicates popular hispanic content and personalities nationally and in markets where we compete in addition the radio broadcasting industry is subject to competition from  sirius xm satellite radio and other satellite radio services  audio programming by mvpds and other digital audio providers and  streaming music businesses such as spotify and pandora many of our competitors have more television and radio stations more internet platforms greater resources financial or otherwise and broader relationships with advertisers than we do furthermore because our englishlanguage competitors are perceived to reach a broader audience than we do they have been able to attract more advertisers and command higher advertising rates than we have we also compete for audience and revenues with other media and direct mail newspapers magazines outdoor advertising and other forms of entertainment and advertising we will face additional competitors for advertising revenue as we expand our offerings for multicultural and young diverse audiences the rules and policies of the fcc encourage increased competition among different electronic communications media as a result of rapidly developing technology we may experience increased competition from other free or pay systems by which information and entertainment are delivered
