take another look at oreilly automotive source google finance  year price chart comparison between orly and spy in oreilly automotives  annual report it stated a key driver to current and future demand in our industry is total miles driven in the us which continues to exceed three trillion miles each year supported by relatively low gas prices and improvements in us employment levels ongoing healthy levels of new car sales and stable low scrappage rates result in a growing vehicle fleet and sustained improvements in engineering and manufacturing have produced higher quality vehicles which can be reliably driven at higher mileages and result in an aging vehicle fleet that now averages  years old we believe the growing aging vehicle fleet will continue to benefit our industry as these higher mileage vehicles are driven trillions of miles each year resulting in ongoing wear and tear and experiencing more routine maintenance cycles which in turn supports stable longterm demand for

oreilly automotive was founded in  by the oreilly family as of the end of march the company operated  stores in  states the company has had  consecutive years of positive comparable store sales growth since it became a public company in april  oreilly automotives profitability indeed oreilly has a track record of sales growth and positive comparable stores sales growth the acquisition of csk auto

leverage and a more aggressive buyback program have contributed to an abnormally high roe in the last few years source of data morningstarcom since  the company has reduced its share count by  however from q  to q  the shares were trading at above its normal multiple in my opinion the company would have been better off paying out a special dividend or waiting for shares to be reasonably priced

conservative multiple of  and an eps growth rate of  an investment in oreilly automotive can deliver annualized returns of about  in three years investor takeaway there will be a continued demand for oreilly automotives products and services as long as people continue to drive the stock has done exceptionally well over the long run despite the underperformance of the shares in the last  years

global wealth management sasummaryin this article we explore the auto parts industrys characteristics and reasons for recent performancewe compare oreillys financial performance against competitorsdoes it make sense to invest after it recently reached all time highs the auto parts and accessories industry is known for being countercyclical when the economy is in trouble people stop buying new cars as they would rather drive their ageing cars even if they have more chances to breakdown hence buying spare parts while the us economy was robust since  with gdp growing at  cagr and unemployment rates reaching levels below  auto parts suppliers still managed to outperform the sp then what could explain the sector performance first and foremost the average age of vehicles on us roads reached  years which is a positive trend for the auto parts industry in fact annual new car sales slumped from  million light vehicles to  million during the  financial crisis auto parts distributors are currently benefiting from the  effects however new car sales just reached precrisis levels so the growth of the average age of vehicles on us roads could slow down secondly the emergence of online sales and the new trend of consumers practicing the do it yourself method to decrease their car expenses indeed selling auto parts online made the product category more reachable and understandable for the large audience online tutorials helped diy develop faster as customers started learning how to repair cars or change auto parts on their own we believe diy will be develop further in the coming years thirdly the industry is reshaping to support the customers new habits indeed to avoid customers bypassing auto mechanics customers can now purchase their spare parts online have it repaired by their mechanics and still benefit from a lower price than previously auto parts distributors are facilitating the new trend by allowing customers to return their purchase within  year thus giving flexibility to customers who are not familiar with the sector to encourage them to purchase directly from auto parts dealers hence we think this is a positive growth catalyst for the sector within this growing industry the  biggest us players are autozone nyseazo advanced auto parts nyseaap and oreilly nasdaqorly the latter has expanded the most in the last decade particularly through acquisitions earnings grew at a cagr of  from  to  eventhough oreilly is currently the third largest chain in the us after azo and aap its market capitalization is the largest in fact orly shares have skyrocketed compared to peers in the last  years we will discuss whether its still worth buying the rally orly data by ycharts a quick look at where the company is coming from founded in  in missouri by the oreilly family the business quickly grew within the state into a  million business with  stores until  the public offering of orly was pivotal as it helped the company finance its external growth to acquire various auto parts distributors that were wellestablished in extended states such as texas california georgia ohio and illinois these states now represent as much as  of total store count among the  existing stores moreover the company has excelled in key financial metrics inventory rationalization among its peers orly is the only company who saw its sales grow faster than inventories indeed inventory on hand is the lowest at  days compared with  days for aap inventories are costly if they grow faster than sales it increases the risk to have a store overloaded with old products preventing the company to order new products that customers are searching for longer inventory days on hand can lead companies to increase product discounts which deteriorates operating margins inventory optimization is crucial in this strong footprint retail business in parallel receivables were well managed growing at  since  the slowest pace among its competitors and also representing the lowest percentage to assets confirming the ability of the company to cash in from customers in relative short periods higher profitability ratios orly has managed to grow ebit margins by bps from  to  in the last  years reaching azo levels which were the highest in the industry at  only bps in  years orly management has proved to have well executed acquisitions as they were accretive to the company indeed profitability ratios improved by double digit in the last decade looking at the return on the capital the company has employed roce and the return on the invested capital nasdaqroic management has developed a track record to efficiently expand the company without compromising profitability strong cash  low debt cash conversion rate is the highest in the industry at  even if ebitda margins have improved considerably the level of free cash flow has grown even faster free cash flow to ebitda is still the highest compared to peers while net debt has risen most due to intense ma activity when you compare it to the ebitda the company has a very reasonable ratio at x management has excellently executed its external growth plan to a degree where investors are demanding and expect history to repeat growth investors are now demanding and have high expectations in the next  years according to bloomberg estimates sales are expected to grow at a cagr of  with an ebitda improving from  to  looking at the forecasted pe ratio for the upcoming years the highest growth in the industry will come from orly as earnings are expected to grow at  in the next  years the price you are paying for the earnings growth is still descent as its lower than  times however if you look back this is the highest level since  everything is not rosy we noticed some flows such as the price to sales which has reached  times while azo is only valued  times and aap  times also price to book value is the highest among peers at more than  times which is very expensive orly peg ratio nysettm data by ycharts in conclusion oreilly is clearly the fastestgrowing and healthier auto parts and accessories supplier within the industry taking into account that in our opinion the industry growth is sustainable oreilly is the best positioned to capture it price to earnings ratios are not at the highest levels currently lower than aap giving the share price room for a future increase management is capable to drive the company as the next market leader in the auto parts industry which justifies paying todays price even if thats close to companys all time highs if you have
