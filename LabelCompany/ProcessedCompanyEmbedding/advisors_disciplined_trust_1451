portfolio of stocks selected using a specialized dividendoriented strategy that seeks above average total return wefn selected the portfolio using the following strategy  we begin with the companies included in the new york stock exchange nyse composite index nasdaq composite index and american stock exchange amex composite index  stocks are eliminated if at the time of selection  the companys stock market capitalization is  billion or less  the companys headquarters is located outside the united states  the stocks are securities of limited partnerships exchangetraded funds investment companies or shares of beneficial interest to the extent such securities are not otherwise excluded from the composition of the indexes  of the remaining stocks we select the five stocks in each of the ten industry sector components with the highest dividend yields the trust invests in these  stocks the ten industry sectors used in the strategy are the global industry classification standard sectors published by standard  poors and msci barra please note that we applied the strategy to select the portfolio at a particular time if we create additional units of the trust after the trusts inception date the trust will purchase the securities originally selected by applying the strategy this is true even if a later application of the strategy would have resulted in the selection of different securities in addition companies which based on publicly available information as of two business days prior to the date of this prospectus are the target of an announced business acquisition which we expect will happen within six months of the date of this prospectus have been excluded from the universe of securities from which the trusts securities are selected principal risks as with all investments you can lose money by investing in this trust the trust also might not perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these  stock prices will fluctuate the value of your investment may fall over time  an issuer may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in the future or may reduce the level of dividends declared this may result in a reduction in the value of your units  the financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the initial offering period  the trusts performance might not sufficiently correspond to published hypothetical performance of the trusts investment strategy this can happen for reasons such as an inability to exactly replicate the weightings of stocks in the strategy or be fully invested timing of the trust offering or timing of your investment and trust expenses  we do not actively manage the portfolio except in limited circumstances the trust will hold and continue to buy shares of the same stocks even if their market value declines  fn aam we and related terms mean

includes  the net asset value per unit plus  organization costs plus  the sales fee the net asset value per unit is the value of the securities cash and other assets in the trust reduced by the liabilities of the trust divided by the total units outstanding we often refer to the public offering price of units as the offer price or purchase price the offer price will be effective for all orders received prior to the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange normally  pm eastern time if we receive your order prior to the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange or authorized financial professionals receive your order prior to that time and properly transmit the order to us by the time that we designate then you will receive the price computed on the date of receipt if we receive your order after the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange if authorized financial professionals receive your order after that time or if orders are received by such persons and are not transmitted to us by the time that we designate then you will receive the price computed on the date of the next determined offer price provided that your order is received in a timely manner on that date it is the responsibility of the authorized financial professional to transmit the orders that they receive to us in a timely manner certain brokerdealers may charge a transaction or other fee for processing unit purchase orders value of the securities we determine the value of the securities as of the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange on each day that exchange is open we generally determine the value of securities using the last sale price for securities traded on a national securities exchange for this purpose the trustee provides us closing prices from a reporting service approved by us in some cases we will price a security based on its fair value after considering appropriate factors relevant to the value of the security we will only do this if a security is not principally traded on a national securities exchange or if the market quotes are unavailable or inappropriate we determined the initial prices of the securities shown under portfolio in this prospectus as described above at the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange on the business day before the date of this prospectus on the first day we sell units we will compute the unit price as of the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange or the time the registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission becomes effective if later organization costs during the initial offering period part of the value of the units represents an amount that will pay the costs of creating your trust these costs include the costs of preparing the registration statement and legal documents federal and state registration fees the initial fees and expenses of the trustee and the initial audit your trust will sell

transactional sales fee has both an initial and a deferred component and equals  of the public offering price per unit based on a  public offering price per unit this percentage amount of the transactional sales fee is based on the unit price on the trusts inception date the transactional sales fee equals the difference between the total sales fee and the creation and development fee as a result the percentage and dollar amount of the transactional sales fee will vary as the public offering price per unit varies the transactional sales fee does not include the creation and development fee which is described under expenses the maximum sales fee equals  of the public offering price per unit at the time of purchase you pay the initial sales fee at the time you buy units the initial sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee percentage maximum of  of the public offering price per unit and the sum of the remaining fixed dollar deferred sales fee and the total fixed dollar creation and development fee the initial sales fee will be approximately  of the public offering price per unit depending on the public offering price per unit the deferred sales fee is fixed at  per unit your trust pays the deferred sales fee in equal monthly installments as described on page  if you redeem or sell your units prior to collection of the total deferred sales fee you will pay any remaining deferred sales fee upon redemption or sale of your units reducing your sales fee we offer a variety of ways for you to reduce the fee you pay it is your financial professionals responsibility to alert us of any discount when you order units since the deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per unit your trust must charge these fees per unit regardless of any discounts however if you are eligible to receive a discount such that your total sales fee is less than the fixed dollar amounts of the deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee we will credit you the difference between your total sales fee and these fixed dollar fees at the time you buy units large purchases you can reduce your sales fee by increasing the size of your investment if you purchase your fee will be  less than                or more  we apply these fees as a percent of the public offering price per unit at the time of purchase we also apply the different purchase levels on a unit basis using a  unit equivalent for example if you purchase between  and  units your fee is  of your public offering price per unit you may aggregate unit orders submitted by the same person for units of any of the trusts we sponsor on any single day from any one brokerdealer to qualify for a purchase level you can also include these orders as your own for purposes of this aggregation  orders submitted by your spouse or minor children living in the same household and  orders submitted by your trust estate or fiduciary accounts if you purchase units that

request is not received in a timely manner or is incomplete in any way you will receive the next net asset value computed after the trustee receives your completed request if you redeem your units the trustee will generally send you a payment for your units no later than seven days after it receives all necessary documentation this will usually only take three business days the only time the trustee can delay your payment is if the new york stock exchange is closed other than weekends or holidays the securities and exchange commission determines that trading on that exchange is restricted or an emergency exists making sale or evaluation of the securities not reasonably practicable and for any other period that the securities and exchange commission permits to redeem your units you must

trusts life we may discontinue this option upon sixty days notice exchange option you may be able to exchange your units for units of our unit trusts at a reduced sales fee you can contact your financial professional for more information about trusts currently available for exchanges before you exchange units you should read the prospectus carefully and understand the risks and fees you should then discuss this option with your financial professional to determine whether your investment goals have changed whether current trusts suit you and to discuss tax consequences we may discontinue this option at any time upon sixty days notice rollover option the trust strategy is a longterm investment strategy designed to be followed on an annual basis you may achieve more consistent longterm investment results by following the strategy as part of the strategy we currently intend to offer a subsequent series of the trust for a rollover when the current trust terminates when the trust terminates you will have the option to  participate in a rollover and have your units reinvested into a subsequent trust series through a cash rollover as described in this section  receive an inkind distribution of securities or  receive a cash distribution if you elect to participate in a rollover your units will be redeemed on the trusts termination date as the redemption proceeds become available the proceeds including dividends will be invested in a new trust series if available at the public offering price for the new trust the trustee will attempt to sell securities to satisfy the redemption as quickly as practicable on the termination date we do not anticipate that the sale period will be longer than one day however certain factors could affect the ability to sell the securities and could impact the length of the sale period the liquidity of any security depends on the daily trading volume of the security and the amount available for redemption and reinvestment on any day we intend to make subsequent trust series available for sale at various times during the year of course we cannot guarantee that a subsequent trust or sufficient units will be available or that any subsequent trusts will offer the same investment strategies or objectives as the current trust we cannot guarantee that a rollover will avoid any negative market price consequences resulting from trading large volumes of securities market price trends may make it advantageous to sell or buy securities more quickly or more slowly than permitted by the trust procedures we may in our sole discretion modify a rollover or stop creating units of a trust at any time regardless of whether all proceeds of unitholders have been reinvested in a rollover we may decide not to offer the rollover option upon sixty days notice cash which has not been reinvested in a rollover will be distributed to unitholders shortly after the termination date rollover participants may receive taxable dividends or realize taxable capital gains which are reinvested in connection with a rollover but may not be entitled to a deduction for capital losses due to the wash sale tax rules due to the reinvestment in a subsequent trust no cash will be distributed to pay any taxes see taxes distributions monthly distributions your trust generally pays distributions of its net investment income prorated on an annual basis along with any excess capital on each monthly distribution date to unitholders of record on the preceding record date the record and distribution dates are shown under essential information in the investment summary section of this prospectus in some cases your trust might pay a special understanding your investment  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th distribution if it holds an excessive amount of cash pending distribution for example this could happen as a result of a merger or similar transaction involving a company whose stock is in your portfolio the trust will also generally make required distributions or distributions to avoid imposition of tax at the end of each year because it is structured as a regulated investment company for federal tax purposes the amount of your distributions will vary from time to time as companies change their dividends or trust expenses change when the trust receives dividends from a portfolio security the trustee credits the dividends to the trusts accounts in an effort to make relatively regular income distributions the trusts monthly income distribution is equal to onetwelfth of the estimated net annual dividends to be received by the trust after deduction of trust operating expenses because the trust does not receive dividends from the portfolio securities at a constant rate throughout the year the trusts income distributions to unitholders may be more or less than the amount credited to the trust accounts as of the record date for the purpose of minimizing fluctuation in income distributions the trustee is authorized to advance such amounts as may be necessary to provide income distributions of approximately equal amounts the trustee will be reimbursed without interest for any such advances from available income received by the trust on the ensuing record date estimated annual distributions the estimated net annual distributions are shown under essential information in the investment summary section of this prospectus we generally base the estimate of the income the trust may receive on annualizing the most recent ordinary dividend declared by an issuer or adding the most recent interim and final dividends declared for certain foreign issuers or on scheduled income payments however dividend conventions for certain companies andor certain countries differ from those typically used in the united states and in certain instances dividends paid or declared over several years or other periods were used to estimate annual distributions due to this and various other factors actual dividends received by the trust will most likely differ from the most recent annualized dividends or scheduled income payments the actual net annual distributions you will receive will vary with changes in the trusts fees and expenses in dividends received and with the sale of securities reports the trustee or your financial professional will make available to you a statement showing income and other receipts of your trust for each distribution each year the trustee will also provide an annual report on your trusts activity and certain tax information you can request copies of security evaluations to enable you to complete your tax forms and audited financial statements for your trust if available

the value of the securities falls the value of your units will also fall we cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period market risk is the risk that the value of the securities in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include  understanding your investment pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a securitys issuer perceptions of the issuer or ratings on a security even though we supervise your portfolio you should remember that we do not manage your portfolio your trust will not sell a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund dividend payment risk is the risk that an issuer of a security is unwilling or unable to pay income on a security stocks represent ownership interests in the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only after the company has provided for payment of its creditors bondholders and preferred stockholders common stocks do not assure dividend payments dividends are paid only when declared by an issuers board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time strategy correlation risk is the risk that the trusts performance will not sufficiently correspond with the hypothetical performance of the trusts investment strategy this can happen for reasons such as  the impracticability of owning each of the strategy stocks with the exact weightings at a given time  strategy performance is based on a calendar year strategy while trusts may be created at various times during the year and generally have  month terms  the trust may not be fully invested at all times and  trust fees and expenses legislation or litigation risk is the risk that various legislative initiatives will be proposed from time to time in the united states and abroad which may have a negative impact on certain of the companies represented in the trust in addition litigation regarding any of the issuers of the securities or of the industries represented by these issuers may negatively impact the share prices of these securities no one can predict what impact any pending or threatened litigation will have on the share prices of the securities liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a security will fall if trading in the security is limited or absent no one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any security no fdic guarantee an investment in the trust is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency hypothetical performance information the following table compares hypothetical performance information for the strategy employed by the trust and the actual performance of the sp  index in each of the years listed below and as of the most recent month these hypothetical returns should not be used to predict future performance of the trust returns from the trust will differ from the hypothetical strategy returns for several reasons such as  total return figures shown do not reflect commissions paid by the trust on the purchase of securities or taxes you will incur  strategy returns are for calendar years and through the most recent month while trusts begin and end on various dates  the trust has a scheduled term longer than one year understanding your investment  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th  the trust may not be fully invested at all times or equally weighted in all stocks comprising its strategy and  the trust often purchases or sells securities at prices different from the closing prices used in buying and selling units you should note that the trust is not designed to parallel movements in any index

when we hold units in the primary or secondary market due to fluctuations in unit prices the gain or loss is equal to the difference between the price we pay for units and the price at which we sell

portfolio taxes this section summarizes some of the main us federal income tax consequences of owning units of the trust this section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust this may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor trust status the trust intends to qualify as a regulated investment company under the federal tax laws if the trust qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law the trust generally will not pay federal income taxes distributions trust distributions are generally taxable after the end of each year you will receive a tax statement that separates your trusts distributions into two categories ordinary income distributions and capital gains dividends ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate however as further discussed below certain ordinary income distributions received from the trust may be taxed at the capital gains tax rates generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units to determine your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends you must calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of your other taxable transactions as described below in addition the trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you the tax status of your distributions from your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional units or receive them in cash the income from your trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales fee if any the tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year understanding your investment  pst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st dividends received deduction a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many dividends received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies however certain ordinary income dividends on units that are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the trust from certain corporations may be designated by the trust as being eligible for the dividends received deduction sale or redemption of units if you sell or redeem your units you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you receive in the transaction your tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units capital gains and losses and certain ordinary income dividends if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  generally  for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets these new capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years beginning before january   for later periods if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally   for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets the  rate is reduced to  and the  rate is reduced to  for longterm capital gains from most property acquired after december   with a holding period of more than five years net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your unit at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be recharacterized as longterm capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations ordinary income dividends received by an individual unitholder from a regulated investment company such as the trust are generally taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain as discussed above provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the trust itself these special rules relating to the taxation of ordinary income dividends from regulated investment companies generally apply to taxable years beginning before january   the trust will provide notice to its unitholders of the amount of any distribution which may be taken into account as a dividend which is eligible for the new capital gains tax rates inkind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may receive an inkind distribution of trust securities when you redeem units or when your trust terminates this distribution is subject to taxation and you will recognize gain or loss generally based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received  understanding your investment pnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future trust it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain and any loss will be treated as a capital loss however any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent that units disposed of are replaced including through reinvestment of dividends within a period of  days beginning  days before and ending  days after disposition of units or to the extent that the unitholder during such period acquires or enters into an option or contract to acquire substantially identical stock or securities in such a case the basis of the units acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss deductibility of trust expenses generally expenses incurred by your trust will be deducted from the gross income received by your trust and only your share of the trusts net income will be paid to you and reported as taxable income to you however if the units of your trust are held by fewer than  unitholders at any time during a taxable year your trust will generally not be able to deduct certain expenses from income thus resulting in your reported share of the trusts taxable income being increased by your share of those expenses even though you do not receive a corresponding cash distribution in this case you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted gross income foreign tax credit if your trust invests in any foreign securities the tax statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your trust paid to other countries in this case dividends taxed to you will include your share of the taxes your trust paid to other countries you may be able to deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes foreign investors if you are a foreign investor ie an investor other than a us citizen or resident or a us corporation partnership estate or trust you should be aware that generally subject to applicable tax treaties distributions from the trust will be characterized as dividends for federal income tax purposes other than dividends which the trust designates as capital gain dividends and will be subject to us income taxes including withholding taxes subject to certain exceptions described below however distributions received by a foreign investor from the trust that are properly designated by the trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes provided that the trust makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met expenses your trust will pay various expenses to conduct its operations the fees and expenses section of the investment summary in this prospectus shows the estimated amount of these expenses the sponsor will receive a fee from your

pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th general information each trust is one of a series of separate unit investment trusts created under the name advisors disciplined trust and registered under the investment company act of  each trust was created as a common law trust on the inception date described in the prospectus under the laws of the state of new york each trust was created under a trust agreement among advisors asset management inc as sponsor evaluator and supervisor and the bank of new york as trustee when your trust was created the sponsor delivered to the trustee securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of units of the trust at the close of the new york stock exchange on the trusts inception date the number of units may be adjusted so that the public offering price per unit equals  the number of units fractional interest of each unit in the trust and estimated income distributions per unit will increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment additional units of each trust may be issued from time to time by depositing in the trust additional securities or contracts for the purchase thereof together with cash or irrevocable letters of credit or cash including a letter of credit or the equivalent with instructions to purchase additional securities as additional units are issued by a trust as a result of the deposit of additional securities by the sponsor the aggregate value of the securities in the trust will be increased and the fractional undivided interest in the trust represented by each unit will be decreased the sponsor may continue to make additional deposits of securities into a trust provided that such additional deposits will be in amounts which will generally maintain the existing relationship among the shares of the securities in such trust thus although additional units will be issued each unit will generally continue to represent the same number of shares of each security if the sponsor deposits cash to purchase additional securities existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the securities and because the trust will pay any associated brokerage fees the trustee has not participated in the selection of the securities deposited in the trust and has no responsibility for the composition of the trust portfolio each unit initially offered represents an undivided interest in the related trust to the extent that any units are redeemed by the trustee or additional units are issued as a result of additional securities being deposited by the sponsor the fractional undivided interest in a trust represented by each unredeemed unit will increase or decrease accordingly although the actual interest in such trust represented by such fraction will remain unchanged units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the trustee by unitholders which may include the sponsor or until the termination of the trust agreement a trust consists of a the securities listed under portfolio in the prospectus as may continue to be held from time to time in the trust b any additional securities acquired and held by the trust pursuant to the provisions of the trust agreement and c any cash held in the accounts of the trust neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure in any of the securities however should any contract for the purchase of any of the securities initially  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th deposited in a trust fail the sponsor will unless substantially all of the moneys held in the trust to cover such purchase are reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement refund the cash and sales fee attributable to such failed contract to all unitholders on the next distribution date investment objective and policies the trust seeks to provide dividend income and capital appreciation by investing in a portfolio of common stocks selected using a specialized dividend oriented strategy that seeks to above average total return there is of course no guarantee that the trust will achieve its objective the prospectus provides additional information regarding the trusts objective and investment strategy the trust is a unit investment trust and is not an actively managed fund traditional methods of investment management for a managed fund typically involve frequent changes in a portfolio of securities on the basis of economic financial and market analysis the portfolio of a trust however will not be actively managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer will not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a portfolio the sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust by the purchase sale or substitution of securities except in special circumstances as provided in the trust agreement thus the assets of a trust will generally remain unchanged under normal circumstances the trust agreement provides that the sponsor may but need not direct the trustee to dispose of a security in certain events such as the issuer having defaulted on the payment on any of its outstanding obligations or the price of a security has declined to such an extent or other such credit factors exist so that in the opinion of the supervisor the retention of such securities would be detrimental to the trust if a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger acquisition or similar transaction has been announced affecting a security the trustee may either sell the security or accept a tender offer if the supervisor determines that the action is in the best interest of unitholders the trustee will distribute any excess cash proceeds to unitholders if your trust receives securities or other property it will either hold the securities or property in the portfolio or sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds the sponsor may direct the reinvestment of security sale proceeds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which in the opinion of the sponsor would make retention of the securities detrimental to the trust in such a case the sponsor may but is not obligated to direct the reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for inclusion in the trust on the trusts inception date the sponsor may also instruct the trustee to take action necessary to ensure that the portfolio continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company for federal tax purposes if the trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company the trustee may sell securities designated by the supervisor from a trust for the purpose of redeeming units of such trust tendered for redemption and the payment of expenses in addition if a trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company the trustee may dispose of certain securities and take such further action as may be needed from time  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th to time to ensure that a trust continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company including the requirements with respect to diversification under section  of the internal revenue code and as may be needed from time to time to avoid the imposition of any tax on a trust or undistributed income of a trust as a regulated investment company proceeds from the sale of securities or any securities or other property received by a trust in exchange for securities are credited to the capital account of a trust for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions except for failed securities and as provided herein in the prospectus or in the trust agreement the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the portfolio securities is prohibited because certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may from time to time under certain circumstances be sold or otherwise liquidated and because the proceeds from such events will be distributed to unitholders and will not be reinvested no assurance can be given that a trust will retain for any length of time its present size and composition neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any security in the event of a failure to deliver any security that has been purchased for a trust under a contract failed securities the sponsor is authorized under the trust agreement to direct the trustee to acquire other securities replacement securities to make up the original corpus of such trust the replacement securities must be purchased within  days after delivery of the notice that a contract to deliver a security will not be honored and the purchase price may not exceed the amount of funds reserved for the purchase of the failed securities the replacement securities must be equity securities of the type selected for the trust and must not adversely affect the federal income tax status of the trust whenever a replacement security is acquired for a trust the trustee shall notify all unitholders of the trust of the acquisition of the replacement security and shall on the next monthly distribution date which is more than  days thereafter make a pro rata distribution of the amount if any by which the cost to the trust of the failed security exceeded the cost of the replacement security once all of the securities in a trust are acquired the trustee will have no power to vary the investments of the trust ie the trustee will have no managerial power to take advantage of market variations to improve a unitholders investment if the right of limited substitution described in the preceding paragraphs is not utilized to acquire replacement securities in the event of a failed contract the sponsor will refund the sales fee attributable to such failed securities to all unitholders of the trust and the trustee will distribute the cash attributable to such failed securities not more than  days after the date on which the trustee would have been required to purchase a replacement security in addition unitholders should be aware that at the time of receipt of such cash they may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in other securities at a return equal to or in excess of the return which such proceeds would have earned for unitholders of such trust in the event that a replacement security is not acquired by a trust the income for such trust may be reduced to the best of the sponsors knowledge there is no litigation pending as of the trusts inception in respect of any security that might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse  pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th effect on the trust at any time after the trusts inception litigation may be instituted on a variety of grounds with respect to the securities the sponsor is unable to predict whether any such litigation may be instituted or if instituted whether such litigation might have a material adverse effect on the trust the sponsor and the trustee shall not be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any security risk factors market risk because the trust invests in stocks you should understand the risks of investing in stocks before purchasing units these risks include the risk that the financial condition of the company or the general condition of the stock market may worsen and the value of the stocks and therefore units will fall stocks are especially susceptible to general stock market movements the value of stocks often rises or falls rapidly and unpredictably as market confidence and perceptions of companies change these perceptions are based on factors including expectations regarding government economic policies inflation interest rates economic expansion or contraction political climates and economic or banking crises the value of units will fluctuate with the value of the stocks in the trust and may be more or less than the price you originally paid for your units as with any investment we cannot guarantee that the performance of the trust will be positive over any period of time because the trust is unmanaged the trustee will not sell stocks in response to market fluctuations as is common in managed investments in addition because some trusts hold a relatively small number of stocks you may encounter greater market risk than in a more diversified investment dividends stocks represent ownership interests in a company and are not obligations of the company common stockholders have a right to receive payments from the company that is subordinate to the rights of creditors bondholders or preferred stockholders of the company this means that common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only if a companys board of directors declares a dividend and the company has provided for payment of all of its creditors bondholders and preferred stockholders if a company issues additional debt securities or preferred stock the owners of these securities will have a claim against the companys assets before common stockholders if the company declares bankruptcy or liquidates its assets even though the common stock was issued first as a result the company may be less willing or able to declare or pay dividends on its common stock additional deposits the trust agreement authorizes the sponsor to increase the size of a trust and the number of units thereof by the deposit of additional securities or cash including a letter of credit or the equivalent with instructions to purchase additional securities in such trust and the issuance of a corresponding number of additional units in connection with these deposits existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the securities and because a trust will pay the associated brokerage fees and other acquisition costs  pst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st administration of the trust distributions to unitholders income received by a trust is credited by the trustee to the income account for the trust all other receipts are credited by the trustee to a separate capital account for the trust the trustee will normally distribute any income received by a trust on each distribution date or shortly thereafter to unitholders of record on the preceding record date the trust will also generally make required distributions or distributions to avoid imposition of tax at the end of each year if it has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company for federal tax purposes unitholders will receive an amount substantially equal to their pro rata share of the estimated net annual income distributions to be received by the trust all distributions will be net of applicable expenses there is no assurance that any actual distributions will be made since all dividends received may be used to pay expenses in addition excess amounts from the capital account of a trust if any will be distributed at least annually to the unitholders then of record proceeds received from the disposition of any of the securities after a record date and prior to the following distribution date will be held in the capital account and not distributed until the next distribution date applicable to the capital account the trustee shall be required to make a distribution from the capital account if the cash balance on deposit therein available for distribution shall be sufficient to distribute at least  per unit the trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the capital or income accounts but may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the use of such funds the distribution to the unitholders as of each record date will be made on the following distribution date or shortly thereafter and shall consist of an amount substantially equal to such portion of the unitholders pro rata share of the estimated annual income distributions to be received by the trust after deducting estimated expenses because dividends are not received by a trust at a constant rate throughout the year such distributions to unitholders are expected to fluctuate persons who purchase units will commence receiving distributions only after such person becomes a record owner a person will become the owner of units and thereby a unitholder of record on the date of settlement provided payment has been received notification to the trustee of the transfer of units is the responsibility of the purchaser but in the normal course of business the selling brokerdealer provides such notice the trustee will periodically deduct from the income account of a trust and to the extent funds are not sufficient therein from the capital account of a trust amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the trust the trustee also may withdraw from said accounts such amounts if any as it deems necessary to establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of a trust amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a trusts assets until such time as the trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the appropriate accounts in addition the trustee may withdraw from the income and capital accounts of a trust such amounts as may be necessary to cover redemptions of units distribution reinvestment unitholders may reinvest distributions into additional units of their trust without a sales fee your trust will pay any deferred sales fee and creation and development fee per unit regardless of any sales fee discounts however if you are eligible to receive a discount such that the sales fee you must pay is less than the applicable deferred sales fee and creation and development fee you will be credited the difference between your sales fee  pnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd and the deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee at the time you buy your units accordingly if you reinvest distributions into additional units of your trust you will be credited the amount of any remaining deferred sales fee and creation and development fee on such units at the time of reinvestment statements to unitholders with each distribution the trustee will furnish to each unitholder a statement of the amount of income and the amount of other receipts if any which are being distributed expressed in each case as a dollar

such an audit would not be in the best interest of the unitholders of the trust the accountants report will be furnished by the trustee to any unitholder upon written request within a reasonable period of time after the end of each calendar year the trustee shall furnish to each person who at any time during the calendar year was a unitholder of a trust a statement covering the calendar year

units thereof then outstanding in addition the sponsor may terminate a trust if it is based on a security index and the index is no longer maintained a trust will be liquidated by the trustee in the event that a sufficient number of units of the trust not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the sponsor so that the net worth of the trust would be reduced to less than  of the value of the

the termination proceedings without in its judgment materially adversely affecting the market price of the securities but it is expected that all of the securities will in any event be disposed of within a reasonable time after a trusts termination the sponsor does not anticipate that the period will be longer than one month and it could be as short as one day depending on the liquidity of the securities being sold the liquidity of any security depends on the daily trading volume of the security and the amount that the sponsor has available for sale on any particular day of course no
