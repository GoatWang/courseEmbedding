better investment decisions for longer holding periods and larger gains the funds researchportfolio management team uses an independent handson inhouseresearchdriven approach to investment management decisionmaking kalmar believes that this conservative approach to small company investing can result in both lower risk and higher rewards over the longer term when compared to the small company

such as appreciation and capital gains a small cap company may appreciate to a mid or large cap company the fund may continue to hold the stock of such companies provided that it is consistent with the funds investment objective and strategies principal risks of investing in the fund      common stocks  the fund invests in common stocks which are subject to market economic and business risks that will cause their prices to fluctuate over time while common stocks have historically been a leading choice of longterm investors stock prices may decline over short or even more extended periods therefore the value of your investment in the fund may fluctuate sometimes rapidly and unpredictably and you could lose money      small cap stocks  a preponderant portion of the funds investments will be in small cap stocks investments in small cap stocks involve greater risks than investments in larger more established companies are more volatile and may suffer significant losses further the market for small cap stocks is generally less liquid than the markets for larger stocks which can contribute to increased price volatility of small cap stocks      market risk  investments in common stocks in general are subject to market economic and business risks that will cause their market value to fluctuate over time therefore an investment in the fund may be more suitable for longterm investors who can bear the risk of these fluctuations      management risk  as with all mutual funds the fund is subject to the risk that an investment strategy used by kalmar may fail to produce the intended result and the fund may be unable to achieve its investment objective      opportunity risk  as with all mutual funds the fund is subject to the risk of missing out on an opportunity because the assets necessary to take advantage of it are tied up in less advantageous investments performance information the bar chart and performance table below illustrates some indication of the risks of investing in the fund by showing changes in the funds performance from year to year and by showing how the funds average annual total returns for  year  years and  years compare with those

for more information    table of contents kalmar pooled investment trust         more information about the investment objective and investment strategies   investment objective the funds investment objective is longterm capital appreciation this investment objective is a fundamental policy and may not be changed without shareholder approval principal investment strategy under normal market conditions the fund will invest at least  of its assets in the common stocks of small cap companies whose stock market capitalizations total equity market value of outstanding shares are  billion or less at the time of purchase using its growthwithvalue investment philosophy kalmar seeks to invest in companies that it believes have the potential for significant future business growth and capital appreciation yet whose stocks at the time of purchase are also trading at prices that are undervalued in the public trading markets small cap growth companies often pay no dividends and therefore current income is not a factor in the selection of stocks capital appreciation is likely to be the main component of the funds return common stocks in which the fund primarily invests represent an ownership interest in the issuer and entitle the holder to participate in any income andor capital gains of the issuer by way of dividends and generally have voting rights kalmars growthwithvalue investment philosophy integrates what it believes to be the best elements of creative growth company investing with discriminating valueseeking investment discipline all with a view toward longerterm ownership of the good growth businesses underlying their stocks in effect kalmar seeks to make investments in dynamic companies capable of strong present and future growth by offering solutions to real problems or innovative products and services to growing markets of substance yet importantly at the same time kalmar carefully seeks to buy such companies stocks at inexpensive or undervalued prices kalmar does not speculate on futuristic developments that may not prove out nor does it buy every other growth managers favorite highlyvalued momentum stocks that will live or die on each penny of the next quarters earnings per share kalmar instead seeks to own dynamic forward looking companies but with a lower risk stock market approach to doing so this investment philosophy is primarily a fundamentalsdriven approach with the goal of fewer better investment decisions for longer holding periods and larger gains kalmar views its growthwithvalue philosophy as a relatively conservative approach to small company investing kalmar also believes that this approach can result in both lower risk and higher rewards over the longer term when compared to the small company equity markets generally or to the typical highturnover aggressive growth or emerging growth investment styles of most other small cap investment managers by investing with a longerterm focus and thereby limiting trading and portfolio turnover the fund seeks to generate higher longterm returns to limit transaction costs and to increase tax efficiency for its shareholders the funds researchportfolio management team uses an independent handson inhouseresearchdriven approach to investment management decisionmaking in identifying solid well managed rapidly growing small cap companies that are worthy of investment the funds portfolio managers perform traditional fundamental security analysis screening and research which is based on a given companys publicly available financial information this analysis includes performing screening and research based on a companys publicly available financial information revenues earnings track record and prospects complementing this the team also employs indepth business analysis to specifically evaluate a companys management and controls profit model technology research and development pipeline competitive positioning growth strategy and dynamics as essential aspects of this analysis the team engages in extensive and ongoing management contact inspects company facilities and cross checks with customers suppliers competitors as well as with industry trade groups consultants and such other experts as it deems appropriate the portfolio management team of course also attempts to utilize the best information provided by wall street analysts and strategists to complement its inhouse research and investment management decision making    table of contents kalmar pooled investment trust       as a central ingredient of its investment philosophy and investment selection process kalmar seeks to invest in promising smaller companies which meet its objectives for above average future business value growth but which at the time of investment have not yet been fully recognized and exploited by other institutional small company investors such companies may be followed by relatively few securities analysts and therefore may be available for purchase at undervalued prices by investing in such companies over the longerterm the funds investors can benefit both from their vigorous potential earnings and business value growth and from the potential revaluation upward of their securities as their business success attracts larger numbers of additional investors and greater wall street sponsorship over time investors should be aware that due to market factors such as appreciation and capital gains a small cap company may appreciate to a mid or large cap company the fund may continue to hold the stock of such companies provided that it is consistent with the funds investment objective and strategies as a result investors should be aware that they may be making an investment in the fund at a time when the funds securities have experienced gains and before sales have taken place recycling the proceeds back into smaller capitalization companies this is an ongoing regular part of the portfolio management process other investment strategies the fund may also purchase investment grade securities with an equity component such as convertible preferred stock debt securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock and securities such as warrants or rights that are convertible into common stock if consistent with its longterm capital appreciation objective a convertible security is a security that may be converted either at a stated price or rate within a specified period of time into a specified number of shares of common or preferred stock by investing in convertible securities the fund seeks to participate in the capital appreciation of the common stock into which the securities are convertible through the conversion feature a warrant is a security that gives the holder the right but not the obligation to subscribe for newly created securities of the issuer or a related company at a fixed price either at a certain date or during a set period rights represent a preemptive right to purchase additional shares of stock at the time of new issuance before stock is offered to the general public so that the stockholder can retain the same percentage ownership in the company and mitigate any potential economic dilution after the new stock offering the fund may consistent with its objective invest a portion of its total assets in equity securities of larger capitalization companies if kalmar believes that suitable small company opportunities are not available or if such larger stocks have strong growth potential and meet kalmars growthwithvalue criteria and investment discipline temporary defensive positions when adverse economic or market conditions occur the fund temporarily may invest up to  of its net assets in shortterm cash equivalent investments the fund may be unable to achieve its investment objective when taking a temporary defensive position while reserving the right to make such strategic moves kalmar has not taken such an extreme position in its experience and generally believes in remaining fully invested risk factors investing in the fund involves the following risks      common stocks  the fund invests in common stocks which are subject to market economic and business risks that will cause their prices to fluctuate over time while common stocks have historically been a leading choice of longterm investors stock prices may decline over short or even more extended periods therefore the value of your investment in the fund may fluctuate sometimes rapidly and unpredictably and you could lose money    table of contents kalmar pooled investment trust          small company risk  while securities of small cap companies may offer greater opportunity for capital appreciation than larger companies investment in such companies presents greater risks than investment in larger more established companies indeed historically small cap stocks have been more volatile in price than larger capitalization stocks among the reasons for the greater price volatility of these securities are the lower degree of liquidity in the markets for such stocks and the potentially greater sensitivity of such small companies to changes in or failure of management and in many other changes in competitive business industry and economic conditions including risks associated with limited product lines markets management depth or financial resources besides exhibiting greater volatility small cap stocks may to a degree fluctuate independently of larger company stocks small cap stocks may decline in price as large company stocks rise or rise in price as large company stocks decline investors should therefore expect that the price of the funds shares will be more volatile than the shares of a fund that invests in larger capitalization stocks additionally while the markets in securities of small companies have grown rapidly in recent years such securities may trade less frequently and in smaller volume than more widely held securities the values of these securities may fluctuate more sharply than those of other securities and the fund may experience some difficulty in establishing or closing out positions in these securities at prevailing market prices there may be less publicly available information about the issuers of these securities or less market interest in such securities than in the case of larger companies and it may take a longer period of time for the prices of such securities to reflect the full value of their issuers underlying earnings potential or assets the fund should not be considered suitable for investors who are unable or unwilling to assume the risks of loss inherent in such a program nor should investment in the fund be considered a balanced or complete investment program      market risk  investments in common stocks in general are subject to market economic and business risks that will cause their market value to fluctuate over time therefore an investment in the fund may be more suitable for longterm investors who can bear the risk of these fluctuations      management risk  as with all mutual funds the fund is subject to the risk that an investment strategy used by kalmar may fail to produce the intended result and the fund may be unable to achieve its investment objective      opportunity risk  as with all mutual funds the fund is subject to the risk of missing out on an opportunity because the assets necessary to take advantage of it are tied up in less advantageous investments a

accounting agent pnc global investment servicing us inc pnc determines the net asset value per share as of the close of the regular trading session of the new york stock exchange the nyse which is normally  pm eastern time each day that the nyse is open the shares will not be priced on the days on which the nyse is closed for trading the net asset value per share is determined by dividing the value of the funds securities plus any cash and other assets less all liabilities by the number of shares outstanding an exchangelisted security is valued at its last sale price on that exchange on the day when the security is valued in the absence of any sales on that day the security is valued at the mean between the closing asked and bid quotations an unlisted security that is quoted on nasdaq is valued at the official closing price reported on nasdaq on the day the security is valued in the absence of any sales on that day the security is valued at the mean between the closing asked and bid quotations a security that is not listed on the nasdaq is valued at the mean between the closing asked and bid quotations where market quotations are readily available portfolio securities are valued based upon market quotations provided those quotations adequately reflect in the judgment of the trust the fair value of the security where those market quotations are not readily available securities are valued based upon appraisals received from a pricing service using a computerized matrix system or based upon appraisals derived from information concerning the security or similar securities    table of contents kalmar pooled investment trust       received from recognized dealers in those securities all other securities and other assets are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the board of trustees when the fund uses fair value pricing to determine the value of securities such securities will not be priced on the basis of quotations from the primary market in which they are traded but rather may be priced using procedures that the board of trustees believe accurately reflects fair value in light of the judgment involved in fair value decisions there can be no assurance that a fair value assigned to a particular security reflects a price for which a security has traded or will trade accordingly when the fund uses fair value to price securities it may value those securities higher or lower than another fund that uses market quotations to price the same securities the fund will value money market securities and debt obligations with less than sixty days remaining to maturity when acquired by the fund on an amortized cost method of valuation excluding unrealized gains or losses thereon from the valuation this is accomplished by valuing the security at cost and then assuming a constant amortization to maturity of any premium or discount from cost versus par value at maturity if the fund acquires a money market security with more than sixty days remaining to its maturity it will be valued at current market value until the th day prior to maturity and will then be valued on an amortized cost basis based upon the value on such date unless the trustees determine during such day period that this amortized cost value does not represent fair market value     how to purchase shares   shares of

fund commenced operations on april   shares of the fund are offered and sold on a noload basis without the imposition of sales or distribution charges kalmar investment advisers the adviser provides management and investment advisory services to the fund investment strategies the funds investment objective is longterm capital appreciation in seeking to achieve its investment objective the fund normally invests at least  of its assets in the common stocks of small capitalization small cap companies whose stock market capitalizations total equity market value of outstanding shares are  billion or less at the time of purchase using its growthwithvalue investment philosophy the adviser seeks to invest in companies which it believes have the potential for significant future business growth and capital appreciation yet whose stocks at the time of purchase are also trading at prices that are undervalued in the public trading markets this sai contains further information concerning the techniques and strategies employed by the adviser in managing the fund the types of securities in which the fund may invest the policies it will follow and the risks associated with the funds investment activities equity securities equity securities include common stocks preferred stocks warrants rights to acquire common or preferred stocks and securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stocks investments in equity securities in general are subject to market risks that may cause their prices to fluctuate over time fluctuations in the value of equity securities in which the fund invests will cause the net asset value of the fund to fluctuate cash or cash equivalents although the fund intends to remain substantially fully invested the fund may invest its assets in cash or cash equivalents during periods when excess cash is generated through purchases and sales of its shares or when the fund desires to hold cash to maintain liquidity for redemptions or pending investments in suitable securities there also may be times when economic or market conditions are such that the adviser deems a temporary defensive position to be appropriate during which the fund may invest up to  of its net assets in the types of shortterm cash equivalent investments described below the fund may invest in shortterm debt securities including time deposits certificates of deposit or bankers acceptances issued by commercial banks or savings and loan associations meeting certain qualifications the fund also may purchase commercial paper rated a or a by standard  poors ratings service sp or prime or prime by moodys investors service inc moodys or if not rated issued by a corporation having an outstanding unsecured debt issue rated highgrade a or better by sp or by moodys and may invest in shortterm corporate obligations rated highgrade a or better by sp or moodys the fund may purchase us government obligations including bills notes bonds and other debt securities issued by the us treasury and may invest in us government agency securities issued or also guaranteed by us government sponsored instrumentalities and federal agencies the fund may also invest in repurchase agreements collateralized by the securities listed above convertible securities traditional convertible securities include corporate bonds notes and preferred stocks that may be converted into or exchanged for common stock and other securities that also provide an opportunity for equity participation    table of contents these securities are generally convertible either at a stated price or a stated rate that is for a specific number of shares of common stock or other security as with other fixed income securities the price of a convertible security generally rises when interest rates decline and vice versa while providing a fixedincome stream generally higher in yield than the income derivable from a common stock but lower than that afforded by a nonconvertible debt security a convertible security also affords the investor an opportunity through its conversion feature to participate in the capital appreciation of the common stock into which it is convertible as the market price of the underlying common stock declines convertible securities tend to trade increasingly on a yield basis and so may not experience market value declines to the same extent as the underlying common stock when the market price of the underlying common stock increases the price of a convertible security tends to rise as a reflection of the value of the underlying common stock to obtain such a higher yield the fund may be required to pay for a convertible security an amount in excess of the value of the underlying common stock common stock acquired by the fund upon conversion of a convertible security will generally be held for as long as the adviser anticipates such stock will provide the fund with opportunities which are consistent with the funds investment objectives and policies when issued securities delayed delivery securities and forward commitments the fund may enter into forward commitments for the purchase or sale of securities including on a when issued or delayed delivery basis in excess of customary settlement periods for the type of security involved in some cases a forward commitment may be conditioned upon the occurrence of a subsequent event such as approval and consummation of a merger corporate reorganization or debt restructuring ie a when as and if issued security when such transactions are negotiated the price is fixed at the time of the commitment with payment and delivery taking place in the future generally a month or more after the date of the commitment while the fund will only enter into a forward commitment with the intention of actually acquiring the security the fund may sell the security before the settlement date if it is deemed advisable securities purchased under a forward commitment are subject to market fluctuation and no interest or dividends accrues to the fund prior to the settlement date the fund will maintain in a segregated manner with the custodian cash or liquid securities in an aggregate amount at least equal to the amount of its outstanding forward commitments foreign securities and adrs the fund may invest up to  of its assets in foreign securities including sponsored or unsponsored american depositary receipts adrs however the adviser anticipates that the majority of the funds assets ordinarily will be invested in us based companies the fund generally limits its foreign investing to adrs and securities of canadian companies traded on canadian or us exchanges or markets adrs are receipts typically issued by a us bank or trust company which evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign corporation the fund may purchase adrs whether they are sponsored or unsponsored sponsored adrs are issued jointly by the issuer of the underlying security and a depository whereas unsponsored adrs are issued without participation of the issuer of the deposited security holders of unsponsored adrs generally bear all the costs of such facilities and the depository of an unsponsored facility frequently is under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications received from the issuer of the deposited security or to pass through voting rights to the holders of such receipts in respect of the deposited securities therefore there may not be a correlation between information concerning the issuer of the security and the market value of an unsponsored adr holding adrs may result in a withholding tax by the foreign country of source which will have the effect of reducing the income distributable to shareholders investments in foreign securities may involve risks not ordinarily associated with investments in domestic securities these risks may include legal political or economic developments such as fluctuations in currency rates imposition of withholding taxes or exchange controls or other government restrictions or political or policy changes in addition with respect to certain countries there is the possibility of expropriation of assets    table of contents confiscatory taxation or political or social unrest that could adversely affect the value of foreign securities there may be less publicly available information about foreign companies than about us companies and foreign companies may not be subject to accounting auditing and financial reporting standards that are as uniform as those applicable to us companies lending of portfolio securities the fund may lend portfolio securities to brokers dealers banks and other financial organizations that meet capital and other credit requirements or other criteria pursuant to the securities lending customer agreement these loans if and when made may not exceed     of the total asset value of the fund including the loan collateral when a fund lends its portfolio securities the collateral ie the cash or securities that the fund is obligated to return can be included as part of the funds total assets in calculating the percentages of the funds total assets on loan loans of portfolio securities will be fully collateralized by cash letters of credit or us government securities and the collateral will be maintained in an amount equal to at least  of the current market value of the loaned securities by marking to market daily collateral must be valued daily by the adviser and the borrower will be required to provide additional collateral should the market value of the loaned securities increase during the time portfolio securities are on loan the borrower pays the fund any dividends or interest paid on such securities while the fund does not have the right to vote securities on loan it intends to terminate the loan and regain the right to vote if this is considered important with respect to the investment the fund will continue to receive interest on the securities lent while simultaneously earning interest on the investment of the cash collateral in shortterm money market instruments however the fund will normally pay lending fees to brokerdealers and related expenses from the interest earned on such invested collateral there may be risks of delay in receiving additional collateral or risks of delay in recovery of the securities or even loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower of the securities fail financially however loans are made only to borrowers deemed by the adviser to be of good standing and when in the judgment of the adviser the consideration which can be earned currently from such securities loans justifies the attendant risk any loan may be terminated by either party upon reasonable notice to the other party the adviser may choose to discontinue lending of the funds portfolio securities at any time short sales the fund is authorized to engage in short sales of stocks which the adviser believes are substantially overvalued if the fund anticipates that the price of a security will decline it may sell the security short and borrow the same security from a broker or other institution to complete the sale the fund may realize a profit or loss depending upon whether the market price of the security decreases or increases between the date of the short sale and the date on which the fund must replace the borrowed security whenever the fund effects a short sale it will maintain in a segregated manner cash or liquid securities equal to the difference between a the market value of the securities sold short and b any cash or securities required to be deposited as collateral with the broker in connection with the short sale but not including the proceeds of the short sale until the fund replaces the security it borrowed to make the short sale it must maintain daily the segregated assets at such a level that the amount designated plus the amount deposited with the broker as collateral will equal the current market value of the securities sold short no more than  of the value of the funds total net assets will be when added together a deposited as collateral for the obligation to replace securities borrowed to effect short sales and b allocated to segregated assets in connection with short sales the value of any one issuer in which the fund is short may not exceed the lesser of  of the funds net assets or  of the securities of any class of the issuers securities the funds policy regarding short sales is considered a fundamental investment policy and may not be changed without approval of a majority of the funds outstanding voting securities borrowing as a matter of fundamental policy the fund may borrow up to one third of its total assets taken at market value as a temporary measure for extraordinary or emergency purposes to meet redemptions or to settle securities    table of contents transactions any borrowing will be done from a bank with the required asset coverage of at least  in the event that such asset coverage shall at any time fall below  the fund shall within three days thereafter not including sundays or holidays or such longer period as the sec may prescribe by rules and regulations reduce the amount of its borrowings to such an extent that the asset coverage of such borrowings shall be at least  the fund will not pledge more than  of its net assets or issue senior securities as defined in the investment company act of  as amended the investment company act except for notes to banks the funds policy regarding borrowings may not be changed without approval of a majority of the funds outstanding voting securities see investment restrictions debt securities the fund is also authorized to invest in debt securities which may include bonds debentures or notes and cash equivalent debt securities as described earlier the fund may invest its assets in debt securities pending investment in suitable equity securities or if the adviser believes such securities have the potential for capital appreciation as a result of improvement in the creditworthiness of the issuer the receipt of income from such debt securities is incidental to the funds investment objective of capital appreciation the fund may invest up to  of its net assets at the time of investment in lower rated fixedincome securities and unrated securities of comparable quality commonly referred to as junk bonds the market value of lowerrated fixedincome securities tends to reflect individual developments affecting the issuer to a greater extent than the market value of higher rated securities which react primarily to fluctuations in the general level of interest rates lower rated securities also tend to be more sensitive to economic conditions than higher rated securities these lower rated fixedincome securities are considered by the rating agencies on balance to be predominantly speculative with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation and will generally involve more credit risk than securities in the higher rating categories even bonds rated bbb by sp or baa by moodys ratings which are considered investment grade possess some speculative characteristics issuers of high yielding fixedincome securities are often highly leveraged and may not have more traditional methods of financing available to them therefore the risk associated with acquiring the securities of such issuers is generally greater than is the case with higher rated securities for example during an economic downturn or a sustained period of rising interest rates highly leveraged issuers of high yielding securities may experience financial stress during these periods such issuers may not have sufficient cash flow to meet their interest payment obligations the issuers ability to service its debt obligations may also be adversely affected by specific developments affecting the issuer the issuers inability to meet specific projected business forecasts or the unavailability of additional financing the risk of loss due to default by the issuer may be significantly greater for the holders of high yielding securities because such securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer the fund may retain an issue that has defaulted because such issue may present an opportunity for subsequent price recovery high yielding fixedincome securities frequently have call or buyback features which permit an issuer to call or repurchase the securities from the fund although such securities are typically not callable for a period from three to five years after their issuance if a call were exercised by the issuer during periods of declining interest rates the fund would likely have to replace such called securities with lower yielding securities thus decreasing the net investment income to the fund and dividends to shareholders the premature disposition of a high yielding security due to a call or buyback feature the deterioration of the issuers creditworthiness or a default may also make it more difficult for the fund to manage the timing of its receipt of income which may have tax implications the fund may have difficulty disposing of certain high yielding securities because there may be a thin trading market for a particular security at any given time the market for lower rated fixedincome securities generally tends to be concentrated among a smaller number of dealers than is the case for securities which trade in a    table of contents broader secondary retail market generally purchasers of these securities are predominantly dealers and other institutional buyers rather than individuals to the extent the secondary trading market for a particular high yielding fixedincome security does exist it is generally not as liquid as the secondary market for higher rated securities reduced liquidity in the secondary market may have an adverse impact on market price and the funds ability to dispose of particular issues when necessary to meet the funds liquidity needs or in response to a specific economic event such as a deterioration in the creditworthiness of the issuer reduced liquidity in the secondary market for certain securities may also make it more difficult for the fund to obtain market quotations based on actual trades for purposes of valuing the funds portfolio current values for these high yield issues are obtained from pricing services andor a limited number of dealers and may be based upon factors other than actual sales for a description of debt security ratings please refer to appendix a to this sai options the fund may purchase or sell options on individual securities as well as on indices of securities as a means of achieving additional return or of hedging the value of the funds portfolio provided that at no time will more than  of the funds assets be allocated to premiums or margins required to establish options positions for nonhedging purposes and no more than  of the funds assets will be subject to obligations underlying such options a call option is a contract that gives the holder of the option the right in return for a premium paid to buy from the seller the security underlying the option at a specified exercise price at any time during the term of the option or in some cases only at the end of the term of the option the seller of the call option has the obligation upon exercise of the option to deliver the underlying security upon payment of the exercise price a put option is a contract that gives the holder of the option the right in return for a premium paid to sell to the seller the underlying security at a specified price the seller of the put option on the other hand has the obligation to buy the underlying security upon exercise at the exercise price if the fund has sold an option it may terminate its obligation by effecting a closing purchase transaction this is accomplished by purchasing an option of the same series as the option previously sold there can be no assurance that a closing purchase transaction can be effected when the fund so desires the purchaser of an option risks a total loss of the premium paid for the option if the price of the underlying security does not increase or decrease sufficiently to justify exercise the seller of an option on the other hand will recognize the premium as income if the option expires unrecognized but forgoes any capital appreciation in excess of the exercise price in the case of a call option and may be required to pay a price in excess of current market value in the case of a put option options purchased and sold other than on an exchange in private transactions also impose on the fund the credit risk that the counterparty will fail to honor its obligations the fund will not purchase options if as a result its aggregate obligations relating to outstanding options exceeds  of the funds assets writing covered call options the general reason for writing call options is to attempt to realize income by writing covered call options the fund gives up the opportunity while the option is in effect to profit from any price increase in the underlying security above the option exercise price in addition the funds ability to sell the underlying security will be limited while the option is in effect unless the fund effects a closing purchase transaction a closing purchase transaction cancels out the funds position as the writer of an option by means of an offsetting purchase of an identical option prior to the expiration of the option it has written covered call options serve as a partial hedge against the price of the underlying security declining the fund writes only covered options which means that so long as the fund is obligated as the writer of the option it will through its custodian have deposited the    table of contents underlying security of the option or if there is a commitment to purchase the security segregate a reserve of cash or liquid securities with a securities depository with a value equal to or greater than the exercise price of the underlying securities by writing a put the fund will be obligated to purchase the underlying security at a price that may be higher than the market value of that security at the time of exercise for as long as the option is outstanding the fund may engage in closing transactions in order to terminate put options that it has written purchasing options a put option may be purchased to partially limit the risks of the value of an underlying security or the value of a commitment to purchase that security for forward delivery the amount of any appreciation in the value of the underlying security will be partially offset by the amount of the premium paid for the put option and any related transaction costs prior to its expiration a put option may be sold in a closing sale transaction and profit or loss from a sale will depend on whether the amount received is more or less than the premium paid for the put option plus the related transaction costs a closing sale transaction cancels out the funds position as purchaser of an option by means of an offsetting sale of an identical option prior to the expiration of the option it has purchased in certain circumstances the fund may purchase call options on securities held in its investment portfolio on which it has written call options or on securities which it intends to purchase repurchase agreements for purposes of cash management only the fund may enter into repurchase agreements with qualified brokers dealers banks and other financial institutions deemed creditworthy by the adviser under standards adopted by the board of trustees under repurchase agreements the fund may purchase any of the cash equivalent securities described above and simultaneously commit to resell such securities at a future date to the seller at an agreed upon price plus interest the seller will be required to collateralize the agreement by transferring securities to the fund with an initial market value including accrued interest that equals or exceeds the repurchase price and the seller will be required to transfer additional securities to the fund on a daily basis to ensure that the value of the collateral does not decrease below the repurchase price no more than  of the funds net assets will be invested in illiquid securities including repurchase agreements which have a maturity of longer than seven days for purposes of the diversification test for qualification as a regulated investment company under the internal revenue code repurchase agreements are not counted as cash cash items or receivables but rather as securities issued by the counterparty to the repurchase agreements if the seller of the underlying security under the repurchase agreement should default on its obligation to repurchase the underlying security the fund may experience delay or difficulty in recovering its cash to the extent that in the meantime the value of the security purchased had decreased the fund could experience a loss while management of the fund acknowledges these risks it is expected that they can be controlled through stringent security selection and careful monitoring procedures investments in mutual funds or exchange traded funds the fund may invest in shares of other open and closedend investment companies including exchange traded funds which principally invest in securities of the type in which the fund invests the fund may only invest in other investment companies within limits set by the investment company act which currently allows the fund to invest up to  of its total assets in other investment companies no more than  of the funds total assets may be invested in securities of any one investment company nor may the fund acquire more than  of the voting securities of any investment company certain exchange traded funds have an exemption from the limits set by the investment company act which allows for a larger investment investments in other investment companies including exchange traded funds will generally involve duplication of advisory fees and other expenses illiquid and restricted securities the fund may invest up to  of its net assets in securities which may be considered illiquid by virtue of the absence of a readily available market legal or contractual restrictions on resale longer maturities or other    table of contents factors limiting the marketability of the security generally an illiquid

to them the fund has not requested and will not request an advance ruling from the internal revenue service the irs as to the federal income tax matters described below the irs could adopt positions contrary to those discussed below and such positions could be sustained in addition the following discussion applicable to each shareholder of the fund addresses only some of the federal income tax considerations generally affecting investments in the fund each shareholder is urged and advised to consult such shareholders own tax advisor with respect to the tax consequences of the ownership purchase and disposition of an investment in the fund including but not limited to the applicability of state local foreign and other tax laws affecting the particular shareholder of the funds shares and to possible effects of changes in federal or other tax laws general the fund has elected and intends to continue to qualify for taxation as a regulated investment company ric under the code by qualifying as a ric the fund but not the shareholders will not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of its investment company taxable income and net realized capital gains that it distributes to its shareholders shareholders should be aware that investments made by the fund some of which are described below may involve complex tax rules some of which may result in income or gain recognition by it without the concurrent receipt of cash although the fund seeks to avoid significant noncash income such noncash income could be recognized by the fund in which case it may distribute cash derived from other sources in order to meet the minimum distribution requirements described below cash to make the required minimum distributions may be obtained from sales proceeds of securities held by the fund even if such sales are not advantageous or if permitted by its governing documents through borrowing the amounts required qualification as regulated investment company qualification as a ric under the code requires among other things that a the fund derive at least  of its gross income for each taxable year from dividends interest payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock securities or foreign currencies or other income including but not limited to gains from options futures and forward contracts derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock securities or currencies the qualifying income requirement and net income from certain qualified publicly traded partnerships b the fund diversify its holdings so that at the close of each quarter of the taxable year i at least  of the value of its assets is comprised of cash cash items including receivables us government securities securities of other rics and other securities with those other securities limited in respect of any one issuer to an amount that does not exceed  of the value of its total assets and that does not represent more than  of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and ii not more than  of the value of its assets is invested in the securities other than us government securities or securities of other rics of any one issuer or the securities other than the securities of other rics of two or more issuers controlled by it and engaged in the same similar or related trades or businesses or one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships and c the fund distribute for each taxable year the sum of i at least  of its investment company taxable income which includes dividends taxable interest taxable original issue discount income market discount income income from securities lending net shortterm capital gain in excess of net longterm capital loss certain net realized foreign currency exchange gains and any other taxable income other than net capital gain as defined below and is reduced by deductible expenses all determined without regard to any deduction for dividend paid and ii  of its taxexempt interest if any net of expenses allocable thereto the treasury department is authorized to promulgate regulations under which gains from foreign currencies and options futures and forward contracts on foreign currency would constitute qualifying income for purposes of the qualifying income requirement only if such gains are directly related to the principal business of the fund in investing in stock or securities or options and futures with respect to stock or securities to date no such regulations have been issued    table of contents as a ric the fund generally will not be subject to us federal income tax on the portion of its income and capital gains that it distributes to its shareholders in any taxable year for which it distributes in compliance with the codes timing and other requirements at least  of its investment company taxable income and at least  of the excess of its gross taxexempt interest income if any over certain disallowed deductions net taxexempt interest the fund may retain for investment all or a portion of its net capital gain ie the excess of its net longterm capital gain over its net shortterm capital loss if the fund retains any investment company taxable income or net capital gain it will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates on the amount retained if the fund retains any net capital gain it may designate the retained amount as undistributed net capital gain in a notice to its shareholders who will be i required to include in income for federal income tax purposes as longterm capital gain their shares of such undistributed amount and ii entitled to credit their proportionate shares of tax paid by the fund against their federal income tax liabilities if any and to claim refunds to the extent the credit exceeds such liabilities for federal income tax purposes the tax basis of the shares owned by a shareholder of the fund will be increased by the amount of undistributed net capital gain included in the shareholders gross income and decreased by the federal income tax paid by the fund on that amount of capital gain if for any taxable year the fund fails to qualify as a ric it will be subject to tax in the same manner as an ordinary corporation subject to tax on a graduated basis with a maximum tax rate of  and all distributions from earnings and profits as determined under the us federal income tax principles to its shareholders will be taxable as ordinary dividend income eligible for the  noncorporate shareholder rate for taxable years beginning prior to january   and the dividendsreceived deduction for corporation shareholders excise tax if the fund fails to distribute by december  of each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of  at least  of its taxable ordinary income excluding capital gains and losses for such year  at least  of the excess of its capital gains over its capital losses as adjusted for certain ordinary losses for the twelve month period ending on october  of such year and  all taxable ordinary income and the excess of capital gains over capital losses for the prior year that were not distributed during such year and on which it did not pay federal income tax the fund will be subject to a nondeductible  excise tax the excise tax on the undistributed amounts a distribution will be treated as paid on december  of the calendar year if it is declared by the fund in october november or december of that year to shareholders of record on a date in such month and paid by it during january of the following year such distributions will be taxable to shareholders other than those not subject to federal income tax in the calendar year in which the distributions are declared rather than the calendar year in which the distributions are received the fund intends to actually distribute or be deemed to have distributed substantially all of its net income and gain if any by the end of each calendar year in compliance with these requirements so that it will generally not be required to pay the excise tax the fund may in certain circumstances be required to liquidate its investments in order to make sufficient distributions to avoid excise tax liability at a time when an investment adviser might not otherwise have chosen to do so and liquidation of investments in such circumstances may affect the ability of the fund to satisfy the requirements for qualification as a ric no assurances can be given that the fund will not be subject to the excise tax and in fact in certain instances if warranted the fund may choose to pay the excise tax as opposed to making an additional distribution capital loss carryforwards the fund is permitted to carry forward a net capital loss from any year to offset its capital gains if any realized during the eight years following the year of the loss the funds capital loss carryforward is treated as a shortterm capital loss in the year to which it is carried if future capital gains are offset by carried forward capital losses such future capital gains are not subject to fundlevel federal income taxation regardless of whether they are distributed to shareholders accordingly the fund does not expect to distribute any such offsetting capital gains the fund cannot carry back or carry forward any net operating losses if the fund engages in a reorganization either as an acquiring fund or acquired fund its capital loss carryforwards if any its unrealized losses if any and any such losses of other funds participating in the    table of contents reorganization may be subject to severe limitations that could make such losses substantially unusable the fund may engage in a reorganization in the future original issue discount and market discount the fund may acquire debt securities that are treated as having acquisition discount or original issue discount oid generally a debt obligation with a purchase price less than its principal amount such as a zero coupon bond generally the fund will be required to include the acquisition discount or oid in income over the term of the debt security even though it will not receive cash payments for such discount until a later time usually when the debt security matures the fund may make one or more of the elections applicable to debt securities having acquisition discount or oid which could affect the character and timing of recognition of income inflationprotected bonds generally can be expected to produce oid income as their principal amounts are adjusted upward for inflation a portion of the oid includible in income with respect to certain highyield corporate debt securities may be treated as a dividend for federal income tax purposes a debt security acquired in the secondary market by the fund may be treated as having market discount if acquired at a price below redemption value or adjusted issue price if issued with original issue discount market discount generally is accrued ratably on a daily basis over the period from the date of acquisition to the date of maturity even though no cash will be received absent an election by the fund to include the market discount in income as it accrues gain on its disposition of such an obligation will be treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain to the extent of the accrued market discount in addition payinkind securities will give rise to income which is required to be distributed and is taxable even though the fund receives no interest payments in cash on such securities during the year the fund generally will be required to distribute dividends to shareholders representing the income accruing on the debt securities described above that is currently includable in income even though cash representing such income may not have been received by the fund cash to pay these dividends may be obtained from sales proceeds of securities held by the fund even if such sales are not advantageous or if permitted by such funds governing documents through borrowing the amounts required in the event the fund realizes net capital gains from such transactions its shareholders may receive a larger capital gain distribution if any than they would have in the absence of such transactions borrowing to fund any distribution also has tax implications such as potentially creating unrelated business taxable income options futures and forward contracts the writing selling and purchasing of options and futures contracts and entering into forward currency contracts involves complex rules that will determine for income tax purposes the amount character and timing of recognition of the gains and losses the fund realizes in connection with such transactions gains and losses on the sale lapse or other termination of options and futures contracts options thereon and certain forward contracts except certain foreign currency options forward contracts and futures contracts will generally be treated as capital gains and losses some regulated futures contracts certain foreign currency contracts and certain nonequity options such as certain listed options or options on broad based securities indexes held by the fund section  contracts other than contracts on which it has made a mixedstraddle election will be required to be markedtomarket for federal income tax purposes that is treated as having been sold at their market value on the last day of the funds taxable year these provisions may require the fund to recognize income or gains without a concurrent receipt of cash any gain or loss recognized on actual or deemed sales of section  contracts will be treated as  longterm capital gain or loss and  shortterm capital gain or loss although certain foreign currency gains and losses from such contracts may be treated as ordinary income or loss as described below transactions that qualify as designated hedges are exempt from the marktomarket rule but may require the fund to defer the recognition of losses on futures contracts foreign currency contracts and certain options to the extent of any unrecognized gains on related positions held by it    table of contents the tax provisions described above applicable to options futures and forward contracts may affect the amount timing and character of the funds distributions to shareholders for example the section  rules described above may operate to increase the amount the fund must distribute to satisfy the minimum distribution requirement for the portion treated as shortterm capital gain which will be taxable to its shareholders as ordinary income and to increase the net capital gain it recognizes without in either case increasing the cash available to it the fund may elect to exclude certain transactions from the operation of section  although doing so may have the effect of increasing the relative proportion of net shortterm capital gain taxable as ordinary income and thus increasing the amount of dividends it must distribute section  contracts also may be markedtomarket for purposes of the excise tax when a covered call option written sold by the fund expires such fund will realize a shortterm capital gain equal to the amount of the premium it received for writing the option when the fund terminates its obligations under such an option by entering into a closing transaction it will realize a shortterm capital gain or loss depending on whether the cost of the closing transaction is less than or exceeds the premium received when it wrote the option when a covered call option written by the fund is exercised such fund will be treated as having sold the underlying security producing longterm or shortterm capital gain or loss depending upon the holding period of the underlying security and whether the sum of the option price received upon the exercise plus the premium received when it wrote the option is more or less than the basis of the underlying security straddles section  deals with the taxation of straddles which also may affect the taxation of options in which the fund may invest offsetting positions held by the fund involving certain derivative instruments such as options futures and forward currency contracts may be considered for federal income tax purposes to constitute straddles straddles are defined to include offsetting positions in actively traded personal property in certain circumstances the rules governing straddles override or modify the provisions of section  described above if the fund is treated as entering into a straddle and at least one but not all of its positions in derivative contracts comprising a part of such straddles is governed by section  then such straddle could be characterized as a mixed straddle the fund may make one or more elections with respect to mixed straddles depending on which election is made if any the results with respect to the fund may differ generally to the extent the straddle rules apply to positions established by the fund losses realized by it may be deferred to the extent of unrealized gain in any offsetting positions moreover as a result of the straddle rules shortterm capital loss on straddle positions may be characterized as longterm capital loss and longterm capital gain may be characterized as shortterm capital gain in addition the existence of a straddle may affect the holding period of the offsetting positions and cause such sales to be subject to the wash sale and short sale rules as a result the straddle rules could cause distributions that would otherwise constitute qualified dividend income to fail to satisfy the applicable holding period requirements described below and therefore to be taxed as ordinary income further the fund may be required to capitalize rather than deduct currently any interest expense and carrying charges applicable to a position that is part of a straddle because the application of the straddle rules may affect the character and timing of gains and losses from affected straddle positions the amount which must be distributed to shareholders and which will be taxed to shareholders as ordinary income or longterm capital gain may be increased or decreased substantially as compared to the situation where the fund had not engaged in such transactions in circumstances where the fund has invested in certain passthrough entities the amount of longterm capital gain that it may recognize from certain derivative transactions with respect to interests in such passthrough entities is limited under the codes constructive ownership rules the amount of longterm capital gain is limited to the amount of such gain the fund would have had if it directly invested in the passthrough entity during the term of the derivative contract any gain in excess of this amount is treated as ordinary income an interest charge is imposed on the amount of gain that is treated as ordinary income constructive sales certain rules may affect the timing and character of gain if the fund engages in transactions that reduce or eliminate its risk of loss with respect to appreciated financial positions if the fund enters into certain transactions including a short sale an offsetting notional principal contract a futures or    table of contents forward contract or other transactions identified in treasury regulations in property while holding an appreciated financial position in substantially identical property it will be treated as if it had sold and immediately repurchased the appreciated financial position and will be taxed on any gain but not loss from the constructive sale the character of gain from a constructive sale will depend upon the funds holding period in the appreciated financial position loss from a constructive sale would be recognized when the position was subsequently disposed of and its character would depend on the funds holding period and the application of various loss deferral provisions of the code in addition if the appreciated financial position is itself a short sale or such a contract acquisition of the underlying property or substantially identical property by the fund will be deemed a constructive sale the foregoing will not apply however to the funds transaction during any taxable year that otherwise would be treated as a constructive sale if the transaction is closed within  days after the end of that year and the fund holds the appreciated financial position unhedged for  days after that closing ie at no time during that day period is the funds risk of loss regarding the position reduced by reason of certain specified transactions with respect to substantially identical or related property such as having an option to sell being contractually obligated to sell making a short sale or granting an option to buy substantially identical stock or securities wash sales the fund may in certain circumstances be impacted by special rules relating to wash sales in general the wash sale rules prevent the recognition of a loss by the fund from the disposition of stock or securities at a loss in a case in which identical or substantially identical stock or securities or an option to acquire such property is or has been acquired by it within  days before or  days after the sale short sales the fund may make short sales of securities short sales may increase the amount of shortterm capital gain realized by the fund which is taxed as ordinary income when distributed to its shareholders short sales also may be subject to the constructive sales rules discussed above passive foreign investment companies the fund may invest in a nonus corporation which could be treated as a passive foreign investment company pfic or become a pfic under the code a pfic is generally defined as a foreign corporation that meets either of the following tests  at least  of its gross income for its taxable year is income from passive sources such as interest dividends certain rents and royalties or capital gains or  an average of at least  of its assets produce or are held for the production of such passive income if the fund acquires any equity interest in a pfic the fund could be subject to federal income tax and interest charges on excess distributions received from the stock of the pfic held by it or on any gain from the sale of such equity interest in the pfic collectively pfic income plus interest thereon even if the fund distributes the pfic income as a taxable dividend to its shareholders the balance of the pfic income will be included in the funds investment company taxable income and accordingly will not be taxable to it to the extent it distributes that income to its shareholders the funds distributions of pfic income if any will be taxable as ordinary income even though absent the application of the pfic rules some portion of the distributions may have been classified as capital gain the fund will not be permitted to pass through to its shareholders any credit or deduction for taxes and interest charges incurred with respect to a pfic payment of this tax would therefore reduce the funds economic return from its investment in pfic shares to the extent the fund invests in a pfic it may elect to treat the pfic as a qualified electing fund qef then instead of the tax and interest obligation described above on excess distributions the fund would be required to include in income each taxable year its pro rata share of the qefs annual ordinary earnings and net capital gain as a result of a qef election the fund would likely have to distribute to its shareholders an amount equal to the qefs annual ordinary earnings and net capital gain to satisfy the codes minimum distribution requirement described herein and avoid imposition of the excise tax even if the qef did not distribute those earnings and gain to the fund in most instances it will be very difficult if not impossible to make this election because of certain requirements in making the election the fund may elect to marktomarket its stock in any pfic markingtomarket in this context means including in ordinary income each taxable year the excess if any of the fair market value of the pfic stock over    table of contents the funds adjusted basis therein as of the end of that year pursuant to the election the fund also may deduct as an ordinary not capital loss the excess if any of its adjusted basis in the pfic stock over the fair market value thereof as of the taxable yearend but only to the extent of any net marktomarket gains with respect to that stock it included in income for prior taxable years under the election the funds adjusted basis in its pfic stock subject to the election would be adjusted to reflect the amounts of income included and deductions taken thereunder in either case the fund may be required to recognize taxable income or gain without the concurrent receipt of cash foreign currency transactions foreign currency gains and losses realized by the fund in connection with certain transactions involving foreign currencydenominated debt instruments certain options futures contracts forward contracts and similar instruments relating to foreign currency foreign currencies and foreign currencydenominated payables and receivables are subject to section  of the code which causes such gains and losses to be treated as ordinary income or loss and may affect the amount and timing of recognition of the funds income in some cases elections may be available that would alter this treatment but such elections could be detrimental to the fund by creating current recognition of income without the concurrent recognition of cash if a foreign currency loss treated as an ordinary loss under section  were to exceed the funds investment company taxable income computed without regard to such loss for a taxable year the resulting loss would not be deductible by it or its shareholders in future years the foreign currency income or loss will also increase or decrease the funds investment company income distributable to its shareholders foreign taxation income received by the fund from sources within foreign countries may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes tax conventions between certain countries and the united states may reduce or eliminate such taxes if more than  of the funds total assets at the close of any taxable year consist of stock or securities of foreign corporations and it meets the distribution requirements described above the fund may file an election the passthrough election with the irs pursuant to which shareholders of it would be required to i include in gross income in addition to taxable dividends actually received their pro rata shares of foreign income taxes paid by it even though not actually received by such shareholders and ii treat such respective pro rata portions as foreign income taxes paid by them each shareholder will be notified within  days after the close of the funds taxable year whether the foreign taxes paid by it will passthrough for that year generally a credit for foreign taxes is subject to the limitation that it may not exceed the shareholders us tax attributable to his or her total foreign source taxable income for this purpose if the passthrough election is made the source of the funds income will flow through to shareholders the limitation on the foreign tax credit is applied separately to foreign source passive income and to certain other types of income shareholders may be unable to claim a credit for the full amount of their proportionate share of the foreign taxes paid by the fund various limitations including a minimum holding period requirement apply to limit the credit and deduction for foreign taxes for purposes of regular federal tax and alternative minimum tax reits the fund may invest in reits investments in reit equity securities may require the fund to accrue and distribute taxable income without the concurrent receipt of cash to generate sufficient cash to make the requisite distributions the fund may be required to sell securities in its portfolio including when it is not advantageous to do so that it otherwise would have continued to hold the funds investments in reit equity securities may at other times result in its receipt of cash in excess of the reits earnings if the fund distributes these amounts these distributions could constitute a return of capital to its shareholders for federal income tax purposes dividends received by the fund from a reit generally will not constitute qualified dividend income the fund may invest in reits that hold residual interests in remics or taxable mortgage pools tmps or such reits may themselves constitute tmps under an irs notice and treasury regulations that have yet to be issued but may apply retroactively a portion of the funds income from a reit that is attributable to the reits residual interest in a remic or a tmp referred to in the code as an excess inclusion will be subject to federal income tax in all events this notice also provides and the regulations are expected to provide that    table of contents excess inclusion income of rics such as the fund will be allocated to shareholders of such rics in proportion to the dividends received by such shareholders with the same consequences as if the shareholders held the related remic residual interest or invested in the tmp directly as a result the fund may not be a suitable investment for certain taxexemptshareholders see taxexempt shareholders distributions distributions paid out of the funds current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined at the end of the year whether reinvested in additional shares or paid in cash are generally taxable and must be reported by each shareholder who is required to file a federal income tax return distributions in excess of the funds current and accumulated earnings and profits as computed for federal income tax purposes will first be treated as a return of capital up to the amount of a shareholders tax basis in his or her fund shares and then as capital gain for federal income tax purposes distributions of investment company taxable income are generally taxable as ordinary income and distributions of gains from the sale of investments that the fund owned for one year or less will be taxable as ordinary income distributions designated by the fund as capital gain dividends distributions from the excess of net longterm capital gain over shortterm capital losses will be taxable to shareholders as longterm capital gain regardless of the length of time they have held their shares of the fund such dividends do not qualify as dividends for purposes of the dividends received deduction described below noncorporate shareholders of the fund may be eligible for the  longterm capital gain rate applicable to distributions of qualified dividend income received by such noncorporate shareholders in taxable years beginning before january   the funds distribution will be treated as qualified dividend income and therefore eligible for the  rate to the extent that it receives dividend income from taxable domestic corporations and certain qualified foreign corporations provided that certain holding periods and other requirements are met a corporate shareholder of the fund may be eligible for the dividends received deduction with respect to the funds distributions attributable to dividends received by the fund from domestic corporations which if received directly by the corporate shareholder would qualify for such a deduction for eligible corporate shareholders the dividends received deduction may be subject to certain reductions and a distribution by the fund attributable to dividends of a domestic corporation will be eligible for the deduction only if certain holding period and other requirements are met not later than  days after the close of each calendar year the fund will inform shareholders of the federal income tax status of its dividends and distributions including the portion of such dividends if any that qualifies as longterm capital gain different tax treatment including penalties on certain excess contributions and deferrals certain preretirement and postretirement distributions and certain prohibited transactions is accorded to accounts maintained as qualified retirement plans shareholders should consult their tax advisors for more information purchases of fund shares prior to purchasing shares in the fund the impact of dividends or distributions which are expected to be or have been declared but not paid should be carefully considered any dividend or distribution declared shortly after a purchase of such shares prior to the record date will have the effect of reducing the per share net asset value by the per share amount of the dividend or distribution and to the extent the distribution consists of the funds taxable income the purchasing shareholder will be taxed on the taxable portion of the dividend or distribution received even though some or all of the amount distributed may effectively be a return of capital sales exchanges or redemptions upon the disposition of shares of the fund whether by redemption sale or exchange a shareholder may realize a capital gain or loss such capital gain or loss will be longterm or shortterm depending upon the shareholders holding period for the shares the capital gain will be longterm if the shares were held for more than  months and shortterm if held for  months or less any loss realized on a disposition will be disallowed under the wash sale rules to the extent that the shares disposed of    table of contents by the shareholder are replaced by the shareholder through reinvestment of dividends or otherwise within a period of  days beginning  days before and ending  days after the date of disposition any loss disallowed under the wash sale rules will be allocated to the shareholders basis in the newly purchased shares any loss realized by a shareholder on a disposition of shares held by the shareholder for six months or less will be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent of any distributions of capital gain dividends received by the shareholder and disallowed to the extent of any distributions of exemptinterest dividends received by the shareholder with respect to such shares capital losses are generally deductible only against capital gains except that individuals may deduct up to  of capital losses against ordinary income backup withholding the fund generally is required to withhold and remit to the us treasury subject to certain exemptions an amount equal to  of all distributions and redemption proceeds paid or credited to a shareholder of the fund if i the shareholder fails to furnish the fund with the correct taxpayer identification tin certified under penalties of perjury ii the shareholder fails to provide a certified statement that the shareholder is not subject to backup withholding or iii the irs or a broker has notified the fund that the number furnished by the shareholder is incorrect or that the shareholder is subject to backup withholding as a result of failure to report interest or dividend income if the backup withholding provisions are applicable any such distributions or proceeds whether taken in cash or reinvested in shares will be reduced by the amounts required to be withheld backup withholding is not an additional tax any amounts withheld may be credited against a shareholders us federal income tax liability state and local taxes state and local laws often differ from

for losses realized on the sale of shares of the fund and capital gain dividends provided that the fund obtains a properly completed and signed certificate of foreign status unless i such gains or

are generally attributable to a rics net interest income earned on certain debt obligations and paid to nonus shareholders in order to qualify as an interestrelated dividend the fund must designate a distribution as such in a written notice mailed to its shareholders not later than  days after the close of its taxable year distributions of the fund when at least  of its assets are usrpis as defined in the code and treasury regulations to the extent the distributions are attributable to gains from sales or exchanges of usrpis including    table of contents gains on the sale or exchange of
