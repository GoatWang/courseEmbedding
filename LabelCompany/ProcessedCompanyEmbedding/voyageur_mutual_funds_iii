that aggressive growth fund and growth stock fund provided exceptional results for their first year under the stewardship of delaware investments aggressive growth fund aggressive growth fund achieved a total return of  for the  months ended april   for a class shares at net asset value with distributions reinvested this was more than double the  total return of the unmanaged standard  poors  index for the period nearly doubling ones money in a single year is a brilliant  and rare  accomplishment aggressive growth fund was in the right place at the right time the fund had strong weightings in technology retailing and consumer service stocks that performed well in fiscal  and higherthanaverage cash positions prior to periods of market weakness market appreciation and new investments nearly tripled the size of aggressive growth fund during the second fiscal half the funds positive cash flow helped the portfolio manager gerald s frey quickly move in and out of stocks of all sizes to maximize capital appreciation potential this strategy while providing high returns in fiscal  also generated a high portfolio turnover rate of  the funds sterling results for fiscal  represented a combination of favorable market forces and prudent stock picking in our view since its inception the funds returns have consistently been in the top  of an increasingly competitive class  growth

some multinational companies lagged the sp  index in general investors feared that some global giants would face reduced earnings from asia the funds sterling results during fiscal  represent a combination of market forces and prudent stock picking in our view given the unprecedented stock appreciation since the mids we doubt the year ahead will be quite as dynamic as fiscal  but it could prove rewarding nonetheless many economic factors in the us remain positive especially for growth stocks inflation appears caged at less than  per year business spending on technology to improve productivity remains substantial economic weakness in asia appears to be having less of an effect on us growth than investors feared last autumn for nearly seven decades delaware investments has built

believe it is imperative to pay constant and careful attention to risk to foresee danger ahead and adapt quickly to changing market conditions although inflation and interest rates fell to near record lows in fiscal  aggressive growth funds management team faced a challenging stock selection environment some industries notably health care were battered by operating andor regulatory problems stock market volatility increased amid recession along the pacific rim among some domesticoriented companies particularly technology firms earnings growth stagnated still we achieved remarkable success your funds results outpaced both the unmanaged sp  index and all of our growth fund peers we chose stocks that helped us outperform many industry groups as shown below while we acquired a solid portfolio from the voyageur fund family in april  aggressive growth funds best performing stocks this past year were our own selections only two of the  stocks in the funds portfolio a year ago were still in the portfolio as of april    wells fargo and ascend communications in our view the funds relatively high  portfolio turnover rate this past year was a byproduct of ebullient market conditions we believe it prudent to realize capital gains to reduce risk rather than allow the funds portfolio to become overheated with overvalued stocks growth our positioning in compusa in fiscal  illustrated this philosophy we purchased shares of the computer retailer in late spring of  the stock did well and we liquidated our position in late autumn as it became clear that the companys fundamental prospects were not as strong as we expected performance by sector aggressive growth fund vs sp  index may   to april   industry group aggressive growth fund sp  index capital goods   technology

fund performance see page  for growth of capital  aggressive growth fund invests in small medium or large companies whose earnings growth rate appears to be accelerating or consistently high typically we look for companies whose profits can grow at least  per year we favor industries likely to benefit from changes in consumer or business buying habits when appropriate we also try to capitalize on situations that temporarily depress a growth stocks price we look for fundamentally sound growth companies whose prices have been affected by shortterm earnings disappointments management turnover or regulatory problems we believe it prudent to realize capital gains to reduce risk rather than allow the funds portfolio to become overheated with overvalued stocks many stocks with high capital appreciation potential have a high risk profile your funds relatively high beta or historical price volatility as shown on page  reflects an aggressive strategy suitable for investors who understand the risks involved increased diversification at the start of fiscal  more than  of the funds holdings were in technologyrelated industries we diversified the portfolio by adding retail entertainment and health care companies and reduced our technology exposure to approximately  of net assets by years end among our top performing holdings were large companies such as bullet lucent technologies atts spin off of the former bell labs bullet midsize companies such as keane inc an applications software company that manages computer help desks and bullet small companies such as amazoncom inc a direct mail book seller health care was our problem child we underperformed other sp  stocks in this industry group because we held positions in two physician practice management firms negatively affected by a failed merger  medpartners and phycor we jettisoned our position in medpartners but have kept phycor which we believe has superior earnings potential graphic omitted aggressive growth

industry  specific dynamics special situationsfallen angels for growth of capital  outlook it is unrealistic to expect the fund to duplicate its fiscal  triumph in the year ahead nevertheless we are optimistic about your funds prospects especially relative to mutual funds with a narrow focus aggressive growth funds approach gives us the flexibility to invest in any size company that we believe possesses superior capital appreciation potential in our view it is better to hold stocks in many companies of different sizes than attempt to predict when one asset class will outperform another diverse overall we believe the single most important factor that will affect your funds results in fiscal  will be the fact that we are a disciplined team working toward a common goal as part of our fundamental spadework with executives in facetoface meetings we ask bullet what controls are there over a business bullet how confident is management in a companys earnings prospects bullet how candid is management when discussing competitors pricing sales and growth todays fast paced equity market requires the agility of a pit crew our team of four experienced analysts and i carefully examine potential stock selections to see what makes a company run we believe expert knowledge of a particular industry and competitive environment can help us distinguish between companies likely to do well

stock fund investment strategy growth stock fund maintains a concentrated portfolio of no more than  stocks with a near equal weighting in each security this number gives us a diverse yet highly manageable portfolio that we believe has greater potential to perform well over time we select stocks based on four criteria bullet high standard  poors quality ratings bullet strong earnings growth potential bullet aboveaverage dividend growth potential and bullet low stock prices relative to earnings strategy your fund invests only in companies with standard and poors quality ratings of a or a stock quality ratings are based on year earnings with companies rated a and a having the most historical consistency in expanding their profits while a high rating doesnt imply a stock is a good buy at a particular moment we believe sp ratings are a valuable starting point that helps us determine which stocks merit further research from a universe of approximately  to  a and a rated companies we look for businesses with strong earnings growth potential based on a consensus of analysts estimates along with dividend growth potential we believe earnings prospects indicate capital appreciation potential finally we focus on companies whose stock prices relative to earnings pe ratios are in the bottom  of their historical range we consider this an indication that a stock is undervalued your funds average holding period for a stock has historically been about four years this longterm approach is reflected in the funds modest portfolio turnover rate which has historically been lower than the average of similar funds that also focus on large company stocks with a blend of growth and value characteristics according to morningstar historically growth stock fund has outperformed the unmanaged sp  index during periods of increased market volatility and underperformed during periods of rapid price appreciation we believe this has occurred because the earnings performance of companies with high sp quality ratings tends to be less dependent on overall economic growth than other companies in the sp  when the economy or stock market is performing well investors tend to increase their risk profile by seeking companies likely to have robust earnings growth high quality and consistency tend to become less important than a rapid rise in profits however once uncertainties such as higher interest rates or international problems enter the picture  as happened this past spring and last autumn  investors tend to covet earnings consistency we therefore believe the current stock market environment  with its concerns about federal reserve board tightening and the impact of the pacific rim recession  bodes well for your fund a longterm low turnover approach

and represent the latest figures available for growth of capital  strategic positioning and outlook by our estimate some  of stocks that met our sp quality criteria were selling within the upper  of their historical price range relative to earnings as of outlook april   while this has made stock selection a challenge we believe that it does not necessarily mean a major market decline is at hand during fiscal  both us inflation and longterm interest rates fell to historical lows this helped support stock prices consumer prices rose just  during fiscal  the smallest rise since the s equally important is that many government economic indicators suggested no sign of inflation on the horizon as of years end the average pe ratio of stocks in the funds portfolio was  times trailing earnings about a  discount to the overall stock market still we believe it was prudent to consider the stock markets downside risks we upgraded the average quality rating of stocks in the funds portfolio in the past year as of years end about two thirds of the stocks in the funds portfolio had quality ratings of a the highest available the average pe ratio of stocks in the funds portfolio was  times

relative to the sp  index a number less than  means less historical price volatility than the index a number higher than  means more historical volatility for growth of capital  generally we sell companies when their pe reaches a historical peak and replace them with companies within the same sector that are trading at historically low pes during the early autumn for example we sold suntrust banks a georgia regional bank to purchase norwest corp a minnesota regional bank in the spring we sold pitney bowes the office equipment company and boosted our position in computer and printer maker
