injury as the recognized leader in the sci field we have a singular focus improving qualityoflife — and redefining life — for the sci patients we serve invivo therapeutics is a company described by many adjectives in the end though invivo is all about hope history invivo therapeutics corporation is a pioneering biomaterials and biotechnology company cofounded in  by mit professor bob langer scd and surgeonscientist joseph vacanti md with a focus on treatment of spinal cord injuries our goal is to develop and commercialize groundbreaking technologies and treatments for spinal cord injury sci currently there are no treatment options to provide meaningful improvement in patient outcomes following sci at the core of invivo’s technology portfolio is the neurospinal scaffoldtm a novel and proprietary biomaterial that is implanted into the epicenter of the injury to modulate the healing environment and serve as a support for neuroregeneration invivo intends to develop its novel neurospinal scaffold to treat acute sci and its bioengineered neural trailstm injectable combinations of biomaterials and neural stem cells to treat chronic sci mission our mission is to redefine the life of the sci patient to date there are no effective therapies treatments or interventions for sci we intend to change that although our mission is simple — “to redefine the life of the sci patient” — the path to accomplishing that mission is complex sci is a devastating trauma and requires a multimodal multidisciplinary treatment approach initial therapeutic successes will likely be incremental while we believe our neurospinal scaffold will be the foundation of effective therapy for acute and chronic sci we are constantly evaluating surgical techniques technologies devices and therapeutics that might be complementary to our technology and bring us closer to our goal what sets us apart invivo’s approach to treating spinal cord injuries revolves around our investigational neurospinal scaffold this bioresorbable and biocompatible synthetic substrate is composed of polylacticcoglycolic acid plga and polyllysine pll two polymers that have been widely used for years the neurospinal scaffold is intended to be inserted into the spinal cord at the site of injury and will break down over several weeks we believe the neurospinal scaffold will modulate the healing environment in acute sci and provide the structural support in acute and chronic injury necessary to promote a local environment supportive of cell survival and growth the unique properties of the neurospinal scaffold make it the only sci therapy focused solely on treating sci directly at the epicenter of the injury the effective deployment of the neurospinal scaffold will require techniques used in other fields of

stage conversation with several site research ethics boards and expects to announce its first canadian site in the coming weeks“this approval is an important step towards our goal of redefining the
