 by monica webb  category  blog time is running out to protect the internet as we know it today is a day to rally a day to talk to reach out and especially to act it’s the last chance to fight to keep fair and equal access to the internet the day we exercise our freedom of speech to maintain the same right online the day we hold high the principle of common carriage the principal that service providers must serve the general public without discrimination a principle that started with blacksmiths innkeepers and ship owners and is today part of our social contracts with public airlines railroads buses taxicabs freight and phone companies and yes internet service providers the latter because as public knowledge said so succinctly “networks are so vital to the functioning of society that the maintenance of such networks cannot be left to the market solely” the internet is the world’s principal source of information we deserve access to all lawful content unedited unfiltered uncensored unfettered we want real journalism not an echo chamber we want to hear all voices not only the ones who’ve paid to speak we don’t want a twotiered system controlling online communication we are not alone at tucows we believe the internet is the greatest agent for positive change the world has even seen we are thrilled and humbled by what can be achieved when billions of people have access to information and a vehicle to communicate collaborate and cocreate we are increasingly wary of large corporations that are willing to compromise customer experiences and impede progress to protect market share we are similarly concerned about politicians that legislate on the internet without truly understanding the world they are affecting so today we ask you to join our voice to protect the open internet by asking the fcc to preserve net neutrality it’s easy we promise tucows reports continuing strong financial results for first quarter of  may    by tucows  category  news

from ringplus we also continued to deploy significant resources to develop our ting internet operations and to invest in building out our ting fiber network with a solid quarter behind us i am pleased to report that we remain on track to meet our adjusted ebitda goal of  million less  million of acquisition related noncash impacts for fiscal ” said elliot noss president and chief executive officer tucows inc “revenue for first quarter grew  yearover year to  million net deferred revenues increased in the first quarter of  by  million primarily due to the enom acquisition prior to the second quarter of  this amount would have been included in our then adjusted ebitda definition overall we are delighted with how each of our businesses executed against core strategies domains took steps toward scale and efficiency ting mobile grew and ting internet improved and invested in fiber network expansion systems and people” added mr noss “with our sound financial position and our significant cash flows we remain well positioned for sustainable growth and continued investment in our strategic priority building fiber” the adjusted ebitda goal information discussed above is a nongaap financial measure see footnote  below for more information on this nongaap measure financial results net revenue for the first quarter of  increased  to  million from  million for the first quarter of  the first quarter’s results only include the contribution from enom’s operations since january   the date the acquisition was completed net income for the first quarter of  decreased to  million or  per share from  million or  per share for the first quarter of  adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of  decreased to  million from  million for the first quarter of  the first quarter of  was impacted by the effect of the purchase price accounting adjustment related to the fair value write down of deferred revenue from the enom acquisition which lowered adjusted ebitda by  million and is a portion of the  million net deferred revenue change noted above the first quarter of  benefited from  million reversal of an overachievement bonus accrual for  that was no longer required and a foreign exchange gain of  million that was not repeated cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter of  decreased slightly to  million compared with  million at the end of the fourth quarter of  and  million at the end of the first quarter of  notes  adjusted ebitda tucows reports all financial information required in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap along with this information to assist financial statement users in an assessment of our historical performance the company typically disclose and discuss a nongaap financial measure adjusted ebitda on investor conference calls and related events that exclude certain noncash and other charges as the company believes that the nongaap information enhances investors’ overall understanding of our financial performance the company believes that the provision of this supplemental nongaap measure allows investors to evaluate the operational and financial performance of the company’s core business using similar evaluation measures to those used by management the company uses adjusted ebitda to measure its performance and prepare its budgets since adjusted ebitda is a nongaap financial performance measure the company’s calculation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap because adjusted ebitda is calculated before recurring cash charges including interest expense and taxes and is not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements of the business it should not be considered as a liquidity measure nongaap financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting and may differ from nongaap financial measures with the same or similar captions that are used by other companies andor analysts and may differ from period to period the company endeavors to compensate for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of the items excluded in the calculation of adjusted ebitda to net income based on us gaap which should be considered when evaluating the company’s results tucows strongly encourages investors to review its financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure the company’s adjusted ebitda definition excludes depreciation amortization of intangible assets income tax provision interest expense interest income stockbased compensation asset impairment gains and losses from unrealized foreign currency transactions and infrequently occurring items including acquisition and transitions costs gains and losses from unrealized foreign currency transactions removes the unrealized effect of the change in the marktomarket values on outstanding unhedged foreign currency contracts as well as the unrealized effect from the translation of monetary accounts denominated in nonus dollars to us dollars prior year adjusted ebitda amounts presented herein have been recast to reflect adjusted ebitda definitional changes described in the company’s form q quarterly report for the three months ended september   the following table reconciles net income to adjusted ebitda dollars in thousands  months ended march  unaudited unaudited net income for the period   depreciation of property and equipment   amortization of intangible assets   impairment of intangible assets –  interest expense net   provision for income taxes   stockbased compensation   unrealized loss gain on change in fair value of forward contracts   unrealized loss gain on foreign exchange revaluation of foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities   acquisition and transition costs  –       adjusted ebitda    acquisition and transition costs represent nonrecurring costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of enom incorporated in january  these costs are primarily comprised of professional fees for legal accounting and other services during  the company identified an immaterial error that affects the classification of certain marketing program costs prior to the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded the cost for certain marketing credits as sales and marketing expense which should have been recorded as a reduction in net revenue the discussion presented here correctly reflect these marketing credits as a reduction in net revenues for all current and comparative periods this resulted in a decrease in net revenues and a corresponding decrease in sales and marketing expenses of  million for the three months ended march     adjusted ebitda goal the adjusted ebitda goal information discussed above is a nongaap financial measure because we are unable to predict certain potentially material items affecting net income on a gaap basis at this time principally the amount deferred revenue will be reduced by the impact of purchasing accounting on historical deferred revenue we cannot reconcile the estimated adjusted ebitda for future years a nongaap measure to net income the most directly comparable gaap measure in reliance on the “unreasonable efforts” exception set forth in sec rules conference call tucows management will host a conference call today tuesday may   at  pm et to discuss the company’s first quarter  results
