tilly’s inc by no author  am edt july   hezy shaked founder chairman and chief strategy officer tilly’s inc retail  consumer products winner hezy shaked has faced many different challenges throughout his life so when he and his wife tilly realized that  was not going to be enough to complete their crosscountry journey of the united states shaked was not shaken a bit he was committed to being the provider his family needed so this young man who had been born and raised in israel took his first us job at a garage his living accommodations were under a staircase but shaked remained positive about his future he took inventory of what he could do and focused on the idea that all humans need clothing so he took a few retail items and a strong work ethic and traveled to an orange county swap meet things began to come together and shaked evolved from a few items at a swap meet to a truck full of new clothing and apparel to the opening of his first retail store in los alamitos calif as the founder chairman and chief strategy officer of tilly’s inc shaked continued to focus on providing value and working hard to get his customers what they wanted he was willing to make investments to build the infrastructure he needed to keep his company growing this high level of commitment is also evident in the way shaked goes about hiring employees and building a strong culture he understands how much his employees depend on him for their livelihood and makes sure they see it every day he is willing to spend money to make things happen but is careful about those decisions so that he doesn’t put the future of the organization at risk it’s a spirit that allows the company to succeed and allows shaked to help those outside tilly’s who really need it the company has consistently supported a number of charitable causes through both its time and monetary donations how to reach tilly’s inc wwwtillyscom leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published required
