excluding       extraordinary items impairment charges on depreciable real estate assets and gains or losses from property dispositions ffo does not represent       cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs       which is disclosed in the companys consolidated statements of cash flows for the applicable periods there are no material legal or functional       restrictions on the use of ffo ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income its most directly comparable gaap measure as an       indicator of the companys operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity management considers ffo a       meaningful supplemental measure of operating performance because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets       diminishes predictably over time ie depreciation which is contrary to what the company believes occurs with its assets and because industry       analysts have accepted it as a performance measure ffo may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other reits   reconciliation of
