forumspecial reportsnewslettersguest authorssearch fedweek handbooks friday july th  handbooks fedweekbig changes expected for federal employees under trump published january  more in fedweekon the eve of the inauguration of president trump federal employees are watching for the imposition of a hiring freeze and cancellation of obama administration workplace initiatives in the short run and potential changes to basic benefits and due process rights in the long run the trump campaign vowed to impose a general hiring freeze–exempting military health and safety positions still not defined–within the administration’s first  days but there’s a widespread expectation that a freeze will be ordered within a few days while the trump campaign did not set a specific workforce reduction target or timeframe past hiring freeze proposals from republicans in congress have targeted a  percent reduction over four or five years other potential early targets are various obama administration memos and orders that can be just as easily changed or canceled by a new memo or order one prime example is the labormanagement cooperation initiative president george w bush countermanded a similar clinton administration program within a month of taking office although later bush issued a second order opening the door to continuing those arrangements at the agency’s discretion some obama administration policies on the federal workplace however were issued to comply with changes in law or court rulings such as those extending spousal benefits in health insurance and retirement to samesex marriages those might be tweaked but could not be fundamentally changed without a change in law or an overriding court decision like this article sign up to receive more fedweek handbooks fers

potential conflicts of interest associated with managed futures programs the success of an investment in such a program is dependent upon the ability of a commodity trading advisor “cta” to identify profitable investment opportunities and successfully trade the identification of attractive trading opportunities is difficult requires skill and involves a significant degree of uncertainty the high degree of leverage often obtainable in futures trading can work against you as well as for you and can lead to large losses returns generated from a cta’s trading if any may not adequately compensate you for the business and financial risks you assume you can lose all or a substantial amount of your investment managed futures accounts may be subject to substantial charges for management and advisory fees it may be necessary for accounts that are subject to these charges to make substantial trading profits in order to avoid depletion or exhaustion of their assets ctas may trade highly illiquid markets or on foreign markets and may not be able to close or offset positions immediately upon request you may have market exposure even after the cta has a request for closure or
