stockbased compensation expense which is a noncash charge v income recognized on the initial recording of mortgage servicing rights that are acquired with no initial consideration and the inherent value of servicing rights which are noncash income amounts and vi the increase decrease in payable under the tax receivable agreement which represents changes in a liability recorded on the company’s consolidated balance sheet determined by the ongoing remeasurement of related deferred tax assets and therefore can be income or expense in the company’s consolidated statement of income in any individual period the company uses adjusted ebitda in its business operations to among other things evaluate the performance of its business develop budgets and measure its performance against those budgets the company also believes that analysts and investors use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to evaluate its overall operating performance however adjusted ebitda has material limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company’s results as reported under gaap the company finds adjusted ebitda to be a useful tool to assist in evaluating performance because it eliminates items related to capital structure and taxes including the company’s tax receivable agreement note that the company classifies the interest expense on its warehouse lines of credit as an operating expense and accordingly it is not eliminated from net income in determining adjusted ebitda some of the items that the company has eliminated from net income in determining adjusted ebitda are significant to the company’s business for example i interest expense is a necessary element of the company’s costs and ability to generate revenue because it incurs interest expense related to any outstanding indebtedness ii payment of income taxes is a necessary element of the company’s costs and iii depreciation and amortization are necessary elements of the company’s costsany measure that eliminates components of the company’s capital structure and costs associated with the company’s operations has material limitations as a performance measure in light of the foregoing limitations the company does not rely solely on adjusted ebitda as a performance measure and also considers its gaap results adjusted ebitda is not a measurement of the company’s financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating income or any other measures derived in accordance with gaap because adjusted ebitda is not calculated in the same manner by all companies it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companiesset forth below is an unaudited reconciliation of consolidated net income to adjusted ebitda for the company for the three months ended march   and      adjusted ebitda for the company is calculated as follows dollars in thousands

expense iii depreciation and amortization iv stockbased compensation expense which is a noncash charge v income recognized on the initial recording of mortgage servicing rights that are acquired with no initial consideration and the inherent value of servicing rights which are noncash income amounts and vi the increase decrease in payable under the tax receivable agreement which represents changes in a liability recorded on the company’s consolidated balance sheet determined by the ongoing remeasurement of related deferred tax assets and therefore can be income or expense in the company’s consolidated statement of income in any individual period the company uses adjusted ebitda in its business operations to among other things evaluate the performance of its business develop budgets and measure its performance against those budgets the company also believes that analysts and investors use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure to evaluate its overall operating performance however adjusted ebitda has material limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company’s results as reported under gaap the company finds adjusted ebitda to be a useful tool to assist in evaluating performance because it eliminates items related to capital structure and taxes including the company’s tax receivable agreement note that the company classifies the interest expense on its warehouse lines of credit as an operating expense and accordingly it is not eliminated from net income in determining adjusted ebitda some of the items that the company has eliminated from net income in determining adjusted ebitda are significant to the company’s business for example i interest expense is a necessary element of the company’s costs and ability to generate revenue because it incurs interest expense related to any outstanding indebtedness ii payment of income taxes is a necessary element of the company’s costs and iii depreciation and amortization are necessary elements of the company’s costsany measure that eliminates components of the company’s capital structure and costs associated with the company’s operations has material limitations as a performance measure in light of the foregoing limitations the company does not rely solely on adjusted ebitda as a performance measure and also considers its gaap results adjusted ebitda is not a measurement of the company’s financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating income or any other measures derived in accordance with gaap because adjusted ebitda is not calculated in the same manner by all companies it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companiesset
