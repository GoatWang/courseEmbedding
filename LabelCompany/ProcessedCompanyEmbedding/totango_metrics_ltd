monitor product performance improved satisfaction measurements aim to give organization tailored customer insights by oren smilansky posted jun   page  totango a provider of cloudbased customer success management tools yesterday announced the release of roi metrics which aims to help companies more precisely measure product performance among customersaccording to kaiser mullaferoze chief marketing officer at totango all too often brands rely on ineffective metrics to determine customer health measurements like customer satisfaction surveys nps scores or the number of existing customer support tickets are subjective mullaferoze says how often does a company run a satisfaction survey and what does that tell it about the health of its customersroi metrics tries to fill those gaps the package builds on totangos customer engagement platform which uses sensors to keep track of data that flows across specified web pages the formula builder feature allows users to create custom metrics that offer insights into roi in particular areas those results can also be used to compose customer profiles and reports that can be shared throughout a company roi metrics can allow a hotel for example to gauge how much extra revenue has been generated by an app allowing customers to upgrade to better roomsfor totango the release is a further push to steer companies toward the customer engagement data that can be collected from their own products mullaferoze suggests that the information companies can glean from their own apps can be just as valuable as the data they store in crm and erp systems he believes that as more businesses adopt subscriptions models it will become increasingly important to create ways to generate revenue with existing customers over time the revenue that you get from your existing customers shadows the revenue that youre going to get from your new customers given the way that the business model works mullaferoze says companies like netflix and amazon have excelled at understanding what users are doing and what experiences theyre having within their applications and services those companies have a clear revenue edge on the market because of this thats what were trying to get across to an entire terrain of digital and subscription businessesexperts working in the space agree that tools to operationalize customer health data are welcome sometimes brands need help seeing how looking at the customer experience will relate to things like longterm customer lifetime value says dr natalie petouhoff principal analyst at constellation research she points out that companies will often neglect the  percent of forum users who typically dont comment on a product instead feeding off what the  percent who do comment are saying brands can get left in the dark and suddenly go out of business not realizing how unhappy customers were or that the business was in trouble because those brands are not paying attention they don’t know what customers feeldigital business models reward the postsale ondemand attention economy adds ray wang founder of constellation research what happens after the sale is the long tail in value creation

complete list of customer success management software is available herecustomer success management software overviewwhat is customer success managementcustomer success management is a relatively new phenomenon that came about as a result of the growing trend of the softwareasaservice saas business model and the subscription economy when companies purchase software as a clouddeployed monthly subscription rather than a large upfront cost for onpremises solutions it’s easier for unsatisfied customers to switch vendors since the bulk of profit is no longer an upfront cost but rather a much lower monthly fee vendors must keep customers around in order to derive revenue therefore some bb technology vendors focus on ensuring their customers are successful – ie deriving continuous and growing value from the technology product – in order to reduce churn rate and increase upsell and crosssell rates this involves actions such as selling to the right customers in the first place making sure they are using the product through onboarding and training providing proactive tech support and making them aware of ways to expand their use of the product in some cases the traditional account manager role has transitioned to customer success managerbenefits  capabilities of customer success management software customer success management software is intended to help companies improve customer retention through increased visibility into the customer base one key feature is tracking customer usage and adoption of your product which can allow you to identify atrisk customers or power

sales organization uses totango to provide insight into client utilization client health contract status and client touchpoints and interactions with the csms and sales team allows us to create playbooks sets of actions for our csms for certain conditions like a new contact is in play or client has a support incident logged it helps address the need for more granular real time insight into client health so we dont have to rely on lagging indicators like nps or csat survey scores it is critical we get out in front of any potential client issues as well as understand how our csms are interacting with their portfolio of clientsprostotango really allows flexibility in dashboarding a client contract you can pull in all the relevant metrics into one spot to help make efficient use of

integration with your productexperience for offline data upload since we dont have a realtime integration with our product we upload on a csv data basis it would be better if totango was more adapted to this kind of use an example of a gap in this matter is that totango doesnt understand the timestamp when the actions were made which means it is like all the actions you uploaded were made in the second you were uploading your csv instead of when it was actually made by your user although i know this development is on the product teams radar it still does not have any forecast for the
