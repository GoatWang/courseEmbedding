investors llc for the acre site occupied by the room  overland park place hotel which was closed last year the developers propose a twophase project that would begin with demolition of the existing singlestory hotel and development of the new sixstory staybridge suites the new hotel would be built owned and operated by kwb hotel partners a sioux falls sd firm that’s developing a hampton inn  suites at th street and us highway  in overland park plus two hotels near th street and interstate  in lenexa curtis petersen a polsinelli pc attorney representing metcalf  redevelopment investors llc said construction of the new hotel is expected to start by the end of this year and be completed by the end of  a second phase would build the sixstory office tower which would include a firstfloor restaurant and a fourandahalf story parking garage containing  spaces that phase would begin when the office building achieves  percent leasing and probably would be completed about two years later petersen said he said his clients plan to request a tif that would divert  percent of new property tax revenue created by the site improvements to assist in financing construction of the garage the developers also plan to request two other types of incentives creation of a community improvement district which would help finance the project through a cent sales tax surcharge and economic activity revenue bond financing which would give the developers a sales tax exemption on their purchases of construction materials furnishings and equipment petersen said the developers are requesting  million in tif reimbursement over  years the tif would have a net present value of  million and after carrying charges would make about  million available for the garage project petersen said the cid sales tax surcharge would bring in an additional  million hotel no office yes councilman dave white voted to advance consideration of tif through creation of the district monday but only after being assured none of the incentives would be used for the new hotel “i don’t want to go down the path of us subsidizing a hotel” white said “our existing overland park hotels are struggling” councilman paul lyons agreed but said that subsidizing the garage to attract needed new class a office space to the city was an appropriate use of tif “this is exactly the type of publicprivate partnership that i see as important for this city” lyons said petersen said the need for new office space in the city is evidenced by overland park’s current class a occupancy rate of  percent he said the project was also worthy of city support due to the improved appearance it will provide at a key gateway location in addition petersen said the project will adhere to overland park’s vision metcalf guidelines which call for dense redevelopment along metcalf avenue charlotte o’hara a former state representative who is running against incumbent carl gerlach for the mayor’s seat in overland park was the only person to speak against the tif district during a public hearing on monday “i implore this body to not create this district” o’hara said adding that the increased use of incentives in the city is “undercutting the funding of the shawnee mission school district” later in the meeting the council voted unanimously in favor of creating the tif district rezoning the site and approving a specialuse permit for the new hotel opportunity from legal woes jim clark ownerbroker of lenexabased oxford realty llc and one of the development partners was in the audience as the project was advanced his partners in metcalf  redevelopment investors are doug gamble of gli hospitality llc a real estate investment management firm that specializes in hotel investments and ken barnes a kansas city attorney clark said a partnership formed by gamble and barnes leased the hotel at metcalf and i with an option to buy it after its previous owners were charged with hiring undocumented workers the hotel had been one of two area clarion hotels owned by munir ahmad chaudary and his wife rhonda bridge according to the us attorney’s office for the district of kansas chaudary and bridge admitted to replacing lawfully employed workers with lowerpaid undocumented workers the couple both of whom received prison sentences also did not pay social security worker’s compensation or unemployment insurance costs for the undocumented workers and did not withhold federal or state income taxes from their paychecks under gamble and barnes’ ownership the hotel continued to operate as  overland park place hotel until its sale to metcalf  redevelopment investors that sale closed on oct  and the hotel was shuttered six days later clark said located at  w th st the hotel was developed by kroh brothers opened in

property owners in overland park will see lower tax rate by roxie hammillspecial to the star linkedin google pinterest reddit print order reprint of this story july    pm buoyed by higher property values and a relatively stable economy overland park city council members proposed a budget monday that would forgo some tax revenues so the taxing rate on property owners could be reduced the proposed  mill levy reduction from the current  mills would not mean cuts in services or programs but would reduce the amount the city has left in reserves however that amount is still high enough that the city’s bond rating should not be hurt council members said the tax rate rollback does not necessarily mean residents will get a smaller tax bill because higher property values could still cause a higher overall bill but if the rollback makes it through the final vote next month the taxes would not be as high as they would have with the original  mills a mill equals  of tax per each  of taxable value an estimate done by city staff showed a relatively small break for homeowners someone with a  home would save about  a year on a  home the amount saved would be  commercial property owners also would see slight savings – about  a year for owners of a  million building and  per year for a  million building at this point in the budget year the mill levy is a target aimed at raising enough revenues to fund city programs the final mill levy is determined in the fall after property assessed values become final the lower tax rate would reduce the city’s cash balance by  million by  meaning the city would have  million rather than  million projected by that year the reduction also would affect the amount the city gets from the special courthouse sales tax but that amount depends on other variables and has not been calculated yet the rest of the total  million budget was left basically unchanged from what was proposed last month the public hearing will be aug  with the final vote scheduled for aug  despite the fairly small savings to homeowners some council members said they wanted to show taxpayers the city would not overtax “i’ve been on this council for  years and during that time we have increased the mill levy twice that i can remember and have not reduced it” said council member paul lyons who had asked for an even bigger rollback of  mills “i feel like now’s the time “it’s important to send a message to our taxpayers that we are doing our due diligence” lyons and others who supported the rollback said they were comfortable with smaller revenues because the city is still able to fund everything the city manager and staff requested and have enough reserve to continue a good bond rating council member terry goodman also said the message to taxpayers is important “at least we’d be sending the message that this council is not just interested in getting all the tax dollars that we possibly can” he said however not all were comfortable with the rollback council member richard collins cited a survey that said overland park residents prize good infrastructure and public safety “i understand we want to send a message but the survey is a message our citizens have sent us” he said once the budget is reduced state restrictions on tax increases might make it more difficult to raise money later if it is needed he added “i’m inclined to say let’s keep those dollars now” he said collins proposed a smaller reduction of threeeighths of a mill dan stock also asked for caution on the rollback saying the city will need to be mindful of aging streetlights and traffic signals the city needs to keep investing in those things to prevent blight he said in the end the committee voted  for the rollback metcalf  in other action the council unanimously ok’d three measures that advanced the metcalf  project at the intersection of interstate  and metcalf avenue the  million project would put a sixstory office parking garage and room hotel on  acres that is considered a gateway into the city the  overland park place hotel built in  and now vacant would be razed the council set up a tax increment financing district and approved rezoning for the office and a special use permit for the hotel the developer metcalf  redevelopment investors llc plans to ask for a community improvement taxing district and sales tax exemptions on materials in addition to the tif district but the particulars of public financing will be considered by the council later the plan calls for building the hotel and its surface parking first followed by the office building and garage once there are enough committed tenants said curtis petersen lawyer for the developer hotel construction could be finished as early as the end of  and the office would take another two years after that he said some council members had qualms about the action and asked for reassurance that public money would not go toward building a hotel “i am not willing to compromise or donate one dollar of tax increment financing to the hotel” said council member david white “our hotels are struggling” he said adding that olathe and lenexa have taken some of the hotel business that used to go to overland park “we do not need another hotel” petersen said the public financing would be devoted solely to the structured parking needed for an office building on that space never
