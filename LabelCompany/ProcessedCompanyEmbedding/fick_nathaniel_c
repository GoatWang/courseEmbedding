and things like that there are some hilarious moments early in the book actually then theres the part on oif which gives a different perspective from evan wrights and the book goes a little beyond that when st recon got back home i thought both books were complementary and one bullet away is definitely worth reading if you liked generation kill i think also nate fick seems to be a pretty admirable man and his book is further proof of that thats just my opinion though less flag see  question about one bullet away… lists with this book best modern day military accounts  books —  voters

you must be willing to order the death of the thing you love this isa very hard thing to do no other profession requires it that is one reason why there are so few good officers although there are many good men michael schaara the killer angels my friend overnighted this book to me when i told him i was joining the national guard he told me to read it before making a decision he hoped that by reading it i would be change my mind it didnt exactly happen like that rather when i finished i felt kind of bad about myself like id failed some ineffable duty still i didnt join the guard but not because of anything ive read in the end it came down to the fact that the guards loan repayment plan is paltry and i wouldve gone underwater on my debt while in training theres also a better funnier story about why i didnt join which involves a long night at the bar and the guard physical scheduled the next day but i wont go into that nathaniel fick went through with it though he joined the marines via officer candidacy school after graduating from dartmouth this memoir tells of his journey from lesserivy league take that dartmouth english major to ocs to sere survival evasion resistance escape to afghanistan to iraq to home it does a good job of capturing the little details of soldiering and highlighting the dichotomy between two very separate worlds that of soldiers and civilians the subtitle of the book is the making of a marine corps officer this implies that the book provides some sort of template which is just not the case fick is unlike any soldier ive ever met  and ive lived and been friends with my share of soldiers he brings to his experiences and this memoir a liberal sensitivity with the requisite lethality of course that is missing in most military men he doesnt join the marines out of monetary necessity to pay for college or because he doesnt have any other options he joined the marines because he really believed in their ethos of duty honor and country but hes not some reaganerareddawnwatchingndamendmentglorifyingwannabegi joe rather he seems to be a really smart guy with a finetuned sense of duty and also i think a bit of intellectual curiosity about the military when he enlists in the faraway days of peace we knew in the late 0s his father tells him that the marines will teach you everything i love you too much to teach you the book is divided into two main sections peace and war the first section is shorter as fick breezes through ocs and infantry training the second half of the book begins with the september  00 terrorists attacks fick goes to afghanistan where frankly nothing much really happens he joins a marine reconaissance batallion and then is sent to iraq this is where the bulk of the story takes place as fick and his recon platoon race towards baghdad coincidentally rolling stone reporter evan wright was embedded with ficks platoon codenamed hitman  and he featured them in his book generation kill making hitman  the most writtenabout and televised group of soldiers since easy company of the 0st who have been immortalized by stephen ambrose in band of brothers fick is a fine easytoread writer he keeps things simple and informative with a good memory for dialogue or a good ear for making up dialogue and a keen sense of telling details with his dartmouth degree going to waste he is fond of literary allusions he never gives any details of his personal life save an offhand reference to a girlfriend so he remains elusive as a person and a blank slate as a narrator that doesnt stop him from giving his opinions however throughout the book he peppers his story with his personal perspective on events for instance after a visit to the site of the former world trade center the socalled ground zero he derides the empty patriotism of the suvdrivingyellowbumperstickertheywontdestroyourwayoflife crowd during his time in iraq he is critical of the blunt instruments of modern warfare which killed and injured the very civilian populace the american military was trying to liberate he also discretely chides his superiors especially his captain whom he pointedly does not mention by name its true that every soldier fights a limited war the things fick sees are his entire universe and expand to fill his imagination even though it is a much smaller part of the whole in other words the sense of a soldier is that he is at the center of the war when in fact history may relegate him and his companions to the peripheryto be sure hitman  is not ambroses band of brothers these are not guys out saving the world they are not even seriously challenged the story takes place during the initial invasion of iraq before ieds and quagmires and the long bloody summer of 0 this is not to say fick and his men werent in danger because they were and they faced it bravely however he went to war with  men and all of them came home alive most of the time the iraqi army does not put up much of a fight the most memorable incidents of this book take place outside of combat such as when the platoon comes upon wounded children there is an especially harrowing scene when ficks battalion commander major benelli refuses to evacuate a wounded girl breaching his selfimposed rule about not naming names fick directly addresses his smirking commander i felt impotent but i wasnt powerless i had an assault rifle in my hands i could shoot the motherfr i could hold him hostage until he called in that helicopter there is also a marvelous scene where sergeant colbert hero of the hbo miniseries generation kill cooly blows up an unexploded rgp round that had landed in a mans yard though doing so was against orders fick realizes this is an instance to do some lasting good though his men didnt fight any pitched battles fick does an especially good job describing modern combat as in this scene where his men fire on a truck that refuses to stop at a checkpointin slow motion i watch 0caliber tracers and mark rounds arcing over the truck it closed the gap on the gunners faster than they could lower their guns for a second i thought hed run right into us the gunners corrected and grenades exploded against the grille and windshield as armorpiercing incendiary machine gun rounds ripped the cab apartstill the truck rushed closeri jammed the rifle stock into my shoulder and flipped the selector

returning home and resigning so he can go to grad school harvard business school and the kennedy school of government natch its a short interesting provocative section there is fick swerving as he goes beneath underpasses because in iraq grenades were often dropped from them there is fick answering questions from an admissions officer who wanted to know about something hed said that appeared in rolling stone do i feel compelled to explain myself to you i dont there is fick taking a friend to antietam which gives him a chance to be ostentatiously rueful about his experiences and subtly belittle the civvie who doesnt understand there is fick getting pissed about people who thanked him for his service this section really calls to mind a fascinating and important questions about military and civilian roles in a democracy ive never served in the military like i said the closest i came was that national guard recruiting office i respect what soldiers do and i am also very wary of what they do undue deference leads to bad policy which should go without saying i grew a little wary of ficks mindset that of superior knowledge which however natural and psychologically explicable leads to a growing gulf between the military and the civilian population the wider the gulf the worse the policy choices in college i lived with a rotc student and i cant even count the number of times my former roomatenowarmylieutenant and i got into political debates without fail at some point in the argument right around the time i had eviscerated him with my slashing logic hed riposte to the effect that you have no right to say that about the army because the army has given you the right to say that its a dangerous bit of selfindulgence on the part of the military to believe they are protecting or even giving us rights thus giving them some control over them it smacks of praetorianism the last section of one bullet away shows that even the most enlightened liberal thinker can fall

excellent first person account of life in the modern military but i think those who have read generation kill may find it most rewarding the discrepancies between the two accounts are fascinating some can be explained simply by the way fick is more gentle with his fellow officers than wright was inclined to behe never for instance calls out captain america for his insane cowardicebut in some places the two stories are genuinely different as tim obrien teaches us there is no such thing as a true war story well written exciting thoughtful informative and interesting this book is an absolute must

service and he joined at exactly the right time to be in the vanguard going to war after i most enjoyed his descriptions of entering the military and his progress through basic and follow on training i’ve been through enlisted and officer basic training and his description of the purposeful craziness had me rolling on the floor one thing for sure marine training is probably the toughest aroundin the middle of his first sea cruise  occurs and his unit is sent to support the afghanistan campaign he goes into pakistan and then into the kandahar area supporting but not involved in any of the major actions returning from afghanistan he is reassigned from command of an infantry platoon to a reconnaissance platoon extending his opportunity to command at the “point of the spear” that is where he is when iraqi freedom occurs he takes us through the battles from kuwait to baghdad concentrating on the daytoday operations no big picture on this war just what he and his platoon went through it was interesting to see his perspective when he finds out his unit was the feint towards baquoba for a move towards baghdad it was a good strategic move but his view on risking his men’s lives for a fake attack was revealing after returning from iraq he leaves the military and gives a clear simple description of ptsd and how it affected himnate fick’s view of the marine corps is very positive as he looks down the chain at his enlisted force and is mostly negative as he looks up the chain i have known some excellent marine officers and have not met the type of “tactical incompetents” he describes his high opinion of the enlisted force continues to the end backed up with plenty of examples in combat this book is not so much about combat post  but about how tough it is to be in combat

what he hates he spends a couple of weeks being forced to perform tasks underwater or in stormy seas until the fear of drowning is beaten out of himthe final part of fick’s memoir recounting his experience as a first lieutenant during the  iraq invasion will be familiar to readers of evan wright’s generation kill fick gives a more personallyfocused and more balanced account of what happened which is perhaps inevitably less interestingi enjoyed this book a lot – though i found the military experiences rather blended together especially due to the sheer size of the book hint it’s long i preferred fick’s more personal and philosophical reflections to the raw action of the book but thats probably just because i’m more interested in people than warriors the fact that fick is a former classics student gives the book a genuine lift fick’s prose is always meditative and frequently beautiful that said fick remains carefully neutral on most political subjects which makes for slightly

reviewed evan wrights generation kill some time ago for those of you who dont know the connection generation kill covers wrights time as an embedded journalist with a platoon of recon marines whose commanding officer was nathaniel fick the author of one bullet away while i enjoyed generation kill very much i also judged it as a book written for an mtv audience  young people with a short attention span and a however misled desire for actionone bullet away is very very different from generation kill and not only because it covers ficks personal journey to becoming a marine officer and some of his missions before the events in generation kill it is different because ficks accounts compared to gk are so well unspectacular he is all rational planning calm  where evans is the terrified and fascinated journalist who sees the heroics of the single man and not the camaraderie of the team that is so evident in everything that fick describes where evans watches and describes fick thinks and writes and people who can truly think are so rarely found these days sighi was fascinated and confused by the lack of information that fick describes he knows has been taught by the marine corps that you can never have all the intel so you must act and plan with what you have for the reader at least for me as a reader this was rather unsettling  how can these men make the decision they have to make when they lack so much important information hell i cant even order a pizza if i dont know what kind of cheese is going to be on itfick doesnt describe this lack of intel so much as he just lives it  this became most apparent to me on his first mission to pakistan and afghanistan  he and the others around him seem to live in an information vacuum onboard their ship opinion building following the press not happening nowhere else did it become so evident to me that we have to overcome the heroic idea that fighting for ones country means fighting for what one believes in fighting for ones country means following orders making the best of the information one is given  fighting for a policy that in the best case scenario you stand behind but most of the time you wont even know what you have to believe in is the idea of serving your country although fick doesnt outright say that in this book but he does so in later articlesand im not saying this to make it worth less  the opposite is the case but it is a truth and i think it is an important truth to know in order to be able to understand any kind of war and it makes perfect sense from a military pov you cant have everyone doing what they think is best  you need them to do what they are told to do fick doesnt complain about this in fact he doesnt seem to object to this what does make him decide to leave the corps in the end is the price you pay for being part of the chain of command  you send men to war and they will get killed and as a commanding officer no matter how little information youve been given by your superiors no matter if you believe in the policy you are fighting for or not  this is going to be your responsibility this had quite an impact on me the fact that for fick for anyone else right there its not about good or bad or right or wrong  its about survival its as basic as thatand honestly i dont know how this makes me feel  there are people fighting out there who are excellent at their jobs  but all they do depends on the words of some policy makers in washington what if the policy is wrong fick doesnt answer this question he doesnt even ask it but i dont think you can read this book without thinking about itthat is not to say that fick is uninformed on the contrary even though he skips the details fick mentions and describes again and again the meticulous planning that goes into preparing missions and giving orders the intelligence gathering the officer meetings the ordering assembling and rechecking of equipment all parts that are virtually nonexistent in evans book where gk sometimes seems to be about a bunch of guys who took an armed roadtrip in iraq for their spring break oba shows that  overall agenda or not see above  these people actually seemed to know what they were doing and in addition to his excellent personal descriptions of his life as a marine officer the book also provides a lot of factual information of the work of the marine corps and its officersand then there is the fact that from everything else ive read not about but from nate fick since then for those who dont know hes the ceo of the think tank cnas he seems to be one of the more intelligent people out there and i agree with mostly everything he says plus he writes so compellingly that i would happily read his shopping list and enjoy doing so and i could never resist really good intelligent reasoning it turns me on yes really but thats beside the point maybeanyway i found this book very very impressive it is wellwritten and informative but it is also personal and heartfelt i am a bit ashamed to admit that i didnt expect fick to be such a good writer i only read his other articles and interviews after i read oba and was therefore surprised that i liked this book even better than i had hoped to like it i have since learned that oba is required reading for many marine officers and i find that decision fully justified an important book that i highly highly

love his bookfick starts off with a glorification of war of the marines of martial life that is to me offputting the grunt life was untainted he writes being a marine was a rite of passage in a society becoming so soft and homogenized that the very concept was often sneered at i could spend all day trying to unpack what fick means by soft but i think the quote shares the flavor of the opening chapters and the hardsoft motif resurfaces throughout the memoirs nearly 0 pagesfick handles death lightly all of his platoon members survive his tour in iraq though some are wounded or killed later the people who die are enemies othered and largely nondescript threats among the marines to kill each other if they screw up as fick does when one of his men offers to blow an undetonated bomb are common but the story lacks the grittiness the nastiness of military memoirs that have lately been turned into successful moviesbut as much as fick loves the marines his platoon his life as a soldier he ultimately leaves the corps because of its seemingly mindless bureaucracy he leaves because he cant imagine putting himself back in harms way if he is surrounded by the kind of people he served his first iraq deployment with the idiots who drive down every road with guns blazing endangering allies and civilians or the ladder climbing fools who want to call in air support strikes simply become another company had called one earlier so the book is not written i think for the military enthusiastfick makes a compelling case for the reassessment of american readiness i was noticing a trend in my career train to lead a rifle platoon but get a weapons platoon train to raid the coastline in rubber boats but go to war in a landlocked country train to jump into patrols via parachute but use boots or humvees in the real world fick chooses to see this train for plan a fight with plan b as a tribute to flexibility but given the dysfunction evident throughout his dealings

candidates school feels far away you sense how much things have changed both for and in him and in the worldthe phrase “support our troops” seems so reflexive and emptied of meaning to my ears i sometimes feel that the speaker of the phrase is trying more to signify something about themselves than actually using it as an exhortation for instance it may be used partly as an utterance of protection against accusations of unpatriotism i know that i used it that way or a phrase like it in college discussions about the war back in so when i say that this book made me truly appreciate the people in the armed forces i am trying my hardest to not make that seem like an empty platitude i can’t imagine facing the decisions and danger that the author and his fellow marines faced the

the story is of his journey from dartmouth undergraduate to marine officer candidate and then as an elite recon marine veteran of iraq and afghanistan you dont need to be strongly interested in the military before reading it as its easily written for a novice like myself and is openly critical of decisions in places thats what makes it standout its a balanced perspective that ultimately points out the importance of competence in harrowing situations fick is a thoughtful writer and his book gave me a greater appreciation for the fear sacrifices and discomfort that military men and women

overinflated opinion of himself as a marine infantry officer myself i can assure you his accomplishments particularly while in training at tbs and ioc are not as glorious as he makes them out to be its an easy and entertaining read but best read with the understanding that ficks picture of himself is embellished by his own delusions of grandeur flag  like · like  · see review dec  0 emma rated

of army or military and who do not often read ficks voice is hard truthful and to the point very masculine i dont think i could get into it because my brain does not function on the combat level but
