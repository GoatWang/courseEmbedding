of the main symbols of the excesses that brought about the financial meltdown of  and the ensuing economic troubles bofa was culpable both through its own actions and those of two troubled companies it acquired in  countrywide financial and merrill lynch  countrywide initiated many of the predatory mortgages that were then bundled by the likes of merrill into securities that turned out to be toxicthose entities ended up costing boa vast amounts including a  justice department settlement with a price tag of nearly  billion in the past few years bofa which was one of the largest beneficiaries of the federal bailout in  onward has had to pay billions of dollars to settle lawsuits alleging misbehavior relating to mortgages and mortgagebacked securities it also got a private bailout in the form of a  billion capital infusion from warren buffett in  the name bank of america dates back to the community banks that ap giannini founded in san francisco in the early th century but the company currently bearing that name is technically the descendent of nationsbank an aggressive bank holding company based in north carolina the old bank of america was a pioneer in the development of branch banking both within california and in other states through a holding company called transamerica which in  was split off on orders of the federal reserve this thwarted the dreams of giannini and his sons of opening branches coasttocoast bank of america nonetheless remained a powerhouse in california and a cornerstone of the west coast business establishment this is why protesters in one of the iconic episodes of the movement against the war in vietnam chose to burn down its branch near the university of california at santa barbara in  in  bank of america ended a tenyear battle with the california state controller by agreeing to pay  million to customers whose dormant accounts were not paid interest and were eventually wiped out by illegal service charges a decade later california’s attorney general sued bank of america accusing it of corruption in its role as bond trustee for the state by misappropriating funds overcharging for services and destroying evidence of its misdeeds dozens of local governments joined the suit which created potential liability for the bank of some  billion as sf weekly put it in a word story in  the lawsuits alleged “a truly astonishing pattern of utterly brazen thievery” in  bank of america agreed to pay  million to settle the case   merging with nationsbank after a particularly rough period stemming from exposure to third world debt and other risky loans bank of america resumed an aggressive growth posture taking over its california rival security pacific in  and failed thrifts in various western states despite these moves bank of america felt it could not survive unless it joined forces with an even larger financial institution as a merger partner it chose nationsbank whose roots went back to the founding of commercial national bank in charlotte north carolina in  various mergers over the following decades led to the formation in  of north carolina national bank which in  established the holding company ncnb corp after hugh mccoll jr a brash exmarine who was called “the george patton of banking” took over as ceo in  ncnb went on an acquisitions binge as it sought to break down the barriers to full interstate banking among its biggest purchases were first republicbank in texas which had been taken over by federal regulators and cssovran the latter deal approved by the federal reserve in  turned ncnb into one of the country’s most powerful financial institutions which mccoll marked by changing the company’s name to nationsbank the newly named banking giant went on to make acquisitions such as st louisbased boatmen’s bancshares and barnett banks in florida it also joined the effort to break down the barriers between commercial banking and investment banking by purchasing montgomery securities nationsbank ran into legal problems after it adopted highpressure tactics in its securities businesses in  it agreed to pay  million to settle a class action suit alleging that its brokerage joint venture with dean witter had engaged in deceptive sales practices   the combination of nationsbank and bank of america took effect in  although nationsbank was
