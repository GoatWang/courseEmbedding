southwest pizzeria  pizzeria biancojames beard worthyforget itlets fight c chef scott simpson  jan    pm i am a chef and restaurant owner in seattle i spent many years as a chef in scottsdale i agree that biancos pizzeria is pretty good yet all the gushing makes me sick i as a chef cannot believe that he was nominated last year for a james beard award this award as you know is by region and selects only a handful of nominees robert mcgrath who is an accomplished outstanding culinarian was nominated and he has earned it bianco is just a talented guy who is a marketing machine i do not feel that he deserves this many kudos there are so many chefs that have much more talent than he marketing has just put him on top i cannot recall what other kitchens he was manning before his own anyway i love a good fight and i want to hear all the boobirds come out of the woodwork or those that agree jump on the bandwagonmaybe joe at pizza hut will get the prestigious beard nomination you would think maybe a brian reilly of crew or some young stud would get the nod reply to post want to stay up to date with this post sign up now › follow log in or sign up to comment posting guidelines

mediocre and and pretentious i restaurantwise phoenix is about the most miserable big city in the united states expensive mediocre and and pretentious i will except allessandro stratta whom you will notice fled the area as soon as he was able and bianco uses honest ingredients is scrupulous about local organic sustainable produce and makes a truly fine product i think it is admirable that the beard committee recognizes this instead of nominating yet more of the confused and awful fusion restaurants in which the region seems to specialize bianco is beloved by the national chef circuit because they realize he prepares close to the only nonmexican food in the godforsaken region worth eating  replies reply clicking the will recommend this comment to others sign up to share the love › re al pastor c canon john c fowler jan    pm dear chowhounds whoever deserves the beard prize chef simpson has accurately taken the culinary temperature of all of maricopa dear chowhounds whoever deserves the beard prize chef simpson has accurately taken the culinary temperature of all of maricopa county indeed the mexican food of the area is eminently forgettable those who know always plan a trip so that they never have to take a meal there motoring you must breakfast in tucson and drive five miles an hour above the speed limit into yuma for lunch i cannot help you going north from phoenix flying you must breakfast or lunch shortly before gate time fly into phoenix eat there in the home of known friends and be gone before the next mealtime if trapped you must get to the nearest picadilly cafeteria acceptable but no more and promise yourself never to make that mistake again dont eat in the numerous overpriced clipjoints of maricopa county including the arizona biltmore you may have a tolerable meal in such places but you will have been taken the information i have imparted here has been known to native tucsonans for more than halfacentury do i harbor a deep dislike for phoenix and its environs i certainly do as did my father and mother before me it is arizona at its basest including food other culture and supremely politics canon fowler reply re canon john c fowler r reggie jan    pm dear chowhounds back to the real issue at hand pizzeria bianco serves straight forward fresh food in a genuine friendly atmosphere dear chowhounds back to the real issue at hand pizzeria bianco serves straight forward fresh food in a genuine friendly atmosphereperiod this is something that is hard to come by in any city lets leave the culinary egos and jealousy at home reply re crsin tastyjon jan    pm old topic i had to do a doubletake the original post was from when clinton was handing bush the keys to the white house since old topic i had to do a doubletake the original post was from when clinton was handing bush the keys to the white house since then bianco did get the james beard award  is as popular as ever and still cranking out the food on a daily basis gotta give him props for that  and maybe the timing of this was strangely intuitive for biancos will now have been opened during  presidential terms if my math is correct reply re al pastor n nyazguy jan    am you should really get your facts straight before you post something you know nothing about first of all alex did not flee this you should really get your facts straight before you post something you know nothing about first of all alex did not flee this area to go to las vegas he was made an offer he couldnt refuse and more power to him he didnt go looking for it steve wynn came to him second of all as of right now he is planning on returning here sometime in the very near future so i doubt he thinks its as awful an area as you do if hes coming back to it or at least considering it reply trending discussions  unique sf restaurant recommendation needed san francisco bay area regional foods  union square food ideas for getaway with a yo san francisco bay area kid friendly trip
