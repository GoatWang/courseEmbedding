story chateau petrus from a prime vineyard on welldrained clay soil atop the pomerol plateau has for decades stood as the worlds greatest example of merlot petruss rise to the top however was rather meteoric happening all at once in the second half of the th century chateau petrus which is really not a chateau at all just a twostory farmhouse km from bordeaux dates to the mid th century the golden age of petrus however didnt begin until after world war ii when madame edmond loubat became sole proprietor of the estate under her direction petrus became one of the first estates in bordeaux to implement green harvesting  a technique used to lower crop yields and increase concentration in mature berries the terroir unique to the  acre site at petrus produces a wine that is extraordinarily creamy and thick but with the substantial tannic underpinning to ensure decades of development in bottle the panoply of exotic aromas and flavors typically encompasses black raspberry mulberry iron cocoa powder truffle and expensive new oak petrus bottlings are generally  merlot although some vintages will contain  of cabernet franc the vineyard itself is planted to  merlot and  cabernet franc an average vintage produces only  cases of the grand vin and no second wine this limited supply accounts for much of the astronomical price of a petrus bottle in  after  seasons as technical director at petrus jean claude berrouet retired and was replaced by eric murisasco berrouets son olivier berrouet is winemaker at petrus and is currently in training to assume the position of technical

“wonderfully drinkable” gambero rosso when gambero rosso’s annual wine guide drops the italian wine world stops as winemakers scan the influential italian magazine’s list to check their fortunes badia di morrona chianti i sodi del paretaio is a perennial gambero favorite having earned multiple “due bicchieri” “two glasses” honors in addition to praise as a “sincere wonderfully drinkable wine” the wine access clients who have stocked their cellars with past vintages of this “especially good value” with “exceptional breadth on the nose” couldn’t agree more and they’ll be first to claim this gem from the excellent  vintage by the case the land of badia di morrona in the picturesque hills between florence and pisa was first worked by th century benedictine monks today it is owned by count gaslini alberti who has invested a fortune in the winery over the past  years outfitting winemaker corrado dal piaz with a refurbished facility enlarged cellars and new casks and barrels dal piaz is notoriously hard on the badia’s  acres of grapes which soak up the sun on south and southeastern exposed slopes strewn with chunks of white limestone he tightened spacing in the vines orchestrating a darwinian competition that leads to tiny berries of high skintojuice ratio the result is sangiovese of great richness and phenolic complexity ’s long growing season allowed temperamental sangiovese to reach rare almost perfectly uniform maturity the vines stretched deep underground sucking up the mineral imprint of the poor soil putting out a dark crushedredfruit sangiovese infused with garrigue and bracketed by perfectly ripe tannins if you’re looking for vibrancy in your topclass chianti you’ll be hardpressed to find anything quite like this luscious  at  and as gambero rosso would advise this is one to be opened — and a case to be bought — without hesitation tasting notes wineaccess travel log the  badia di morrona chianti i sodi del paretaio is bright ruby to the edge with a fabulous
