standard definition programming according to pete sockett chief engineer for wraltv costsavings and singleoperator approach of broadcast pix drove the decision to purchase slate  hd systems for his new studios this all comes down to being a oneman band said sockett the integration of a clip store still store and graphics makes it simple for one person to run the control room and compared to building legacy hd control rooms the slate  hd reduces equipment costs by as much as  per studio because it integrates so many production elements into a single unit according to sockett the new chroma key studios will drive wrals focus to produce more local programming without impeding on the production workflow in the main control room the compact singleoperator platform of the slate  hd
