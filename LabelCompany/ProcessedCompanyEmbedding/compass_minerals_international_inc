search search compass minerals international inc reports mixed demand declining profits the road salt and plant nutrition products producer continues to suffer declining demand for its plant nutrition products though unexpected winter weather in april helped its salt business report slightly better results add it all up and profits fell management cut guidance and the rest of  could be ugly jason hall tmfvelvethammer jul   at pm despite a surge in winter weather in april a mild  winter is expected to weigh on compass minerals sales this year image source getty images compass minerals international inc nysecmp released secondquarter financial and operating results on july  reporting an increase in salt operating earnings partially offset a significant decline in plant nutrition operating earnings to sum it up a mixed bag of slightly better results in one segment and very poor results in another combined with what has been a weak winter deicing bid season and the rest of  could be tough  heres a closer look at compass minerals earnings report and what management said about the outlook for the remainder of  and beyond the numbers metricq q change revenue      net income      earnings per share      revenue and net income in millions data source compass minerals keys to the quarter the overall numbers dont tell the whole story since compass minerals salt and plant nutrition segments produced very different results salt segment revenue increased  because of a  increase in highway deicing volumes lateseason snow in april increased contract volumes and customers fulfilling minimum purchase requirements were behind the latequarter surge both higher ebitda and ebitda margin resulted from improved mix and lower shipping and handling costs average perton sales prices of highway deicing and consumer  industrial salts increased slightly in the quarter  plant nutrition segment revenue fell  in the quarter on a  decline in product volumes and a  decline in prices  ebitda of  million was down  due in large part to sellthrough of sulfate of potash sop produced at a high cost in   theres good news here perunit costs improved  from q as the company sold through the last of its  sop inventory in the quarter and started selling lowercost pondbased sop  compass also reported a  million loss from its overseas investment in produquimica industria e comercio sa though  million of that is noncash and related to the purchase of compass equity investment in produquimica sales general and administrative expense fell  in the quarter  allin the big declines in volume and realized revenue in the plant nutrition segment along with highercost product hurt the company a lot more than the small bounce the salt segment recorded in the quarter  what management said ceo fran malecha didnt waste any time on the earnings call immediately addressing the current environment while emphasizing the actions management is taking to work through the downturn and betterposition the company when the agriculture cycle recovers these results are disappointing but not unexpected given the current down cycle in the agricultural market more important for us is the confidence we have in our longterm strategy based on ensuring the integrity of our assets and improving our cost position completing our investments to expand capacity in salt and sulfate of potash which positions us for organic growth as the markets for deicing salt and specialty potash recover and positioning the company for international growth specifically in brazil with our initial investment in produquimica malecha also addressed the ongoing highway deicing bid season to put it bluntly prices and volumes for the upcoming winter are set to fall with the bid season approximately  complete we estimate that bid volumes across the market we serve have contracted about  that contraction puts pricing under pressure our bid results indicate that our expected average awarded contract price likely will decline about  for the  winter season heres machela on the downturn in plant nutrition and how compass efforts to improve its costs have not yet borne fruit  the overall market for sop in north america appears to have contracted a little over  yeartodate when compared to last year the good news is that the imports have declined significantly this year  perhaps even more than the overall market at a minimum we believe we are holding our share of the north american sop market another piece of good news is certainly that we are improving our production costs for sop we sold through the high cost inventory produced with purchased kcl in  and we are now benefiting from the use of mostly pondbased feedstock because of lower sales volumes this quarter we didnt achieve all of the unit cost savings we had expected this quarter looking ahead when compass minerals last reported earnings in april management cut fullyear earnings guidance from  per share down to  per share unfortunately the continued downturn in agriculture demand and the early results of the winter deicing bid season led to another guidance reduction management is now expecting fullyear earnings of  per share a  reduction at the midpoint  the bottom line is its shaping up to be a tough year for compass both because of weak cyclical demand from the agricultural industry for its specialty plant nutrition products and a series of mild winters weighing heavily on its biggest business providing deicing salts for highways but as malecha said in the release these are seasonal and cyclical things that will eventually shift back into the companys favor maybe as soon as this winter and they are focused on building the core business and on the things that differentiate it from its competitors furthermore the investment in brazilbased produquímica should help with seasonality at some point   the unanswerable question though is how long it will take for those efforts to pay
