simpsonville sc age  gender male quality  value  meets expectations  i really enjoyed this four views its the first of the series ive read but it wont be the last i wasnt sure at first glance if it was a book on the historical paul or his theology it ended up about the later which was a perfect fit because i had already been reading in that area of theology the four contributors were thomas r schreiner luke timothy johnson douglas a campbell  mark d nanos each was commissioned to answer four main questions what did paul think about salvation what was pauls view of the significance of christ what is the best framework for describing pauls theological perspective what was pauls vision for the churches schreiner approached these questions from a reformed baptist perspective luke timothy johnson from a roman catholic perspective douglas a campbell from a post new perspective  nanos from a jewish perspective a simplification of positions but it gives you an idea i sympathized most with schreiners position but also found much to be commended in nanoss chapter as well we have lost some of the jewishness of paul ironically nanos rejects the npp it seems the npp supporters have stepped out the hot pile with one foot and into the steaming leftovers with the other moving the historical focus from legalism to a tacit racism nanos also strongly rejects schreiners position because of some of the historical antiseminism found in its proponents while sympathetic to that point i would have liked a softer blow if paul had actually been against judaism it doesnt follow that against necessarily implies racist or hate for instance i am against mormonism jehovahs witness roman catholics and liberal protestants but i do not wish them harm and would die for their free practice of religion i would love to have schreiner and nanos sit down and have a serious back forth in regards to their positions nanoss counterpoint to schreiner seemed distracted by previous interactions we need more research and study in the field of pauls distinctive jewishness dr tom holland has already rung this bell loudly in his contours of pauline theology read my review i would argue that paul was not antijudaism but he may have been combative against a deformity in it for instance i am a christian and am decidedly for the spread of christianity but also frequently speak out against those who claim the name but who are false teachers we must place christianity in that context its in the same family tree of judaism and therefore we must be decidedly for judaism during jesuss time jesus was a good jew who fulfilled the perfect law of god nanos makes some helpful points like reminding us that when we talk about law we should talk about the teaching about loving god and neighbor his arguments however falls short when trying to prove that the law was in full effect for paul and his fellow jews schreiners commentary was quite constructive in this regard on the other hand i found it surprising that i agreed with a good bit of what johnson said more so than with campbell its ironic that on many principles catholics are closer to conservative protestantism than the liberals are i found campbells sections the least compelling he seemed content to ride the hobby horse all the way into the barn he vehemently rejects the lutheran understand of salvation but doesnt do the perspective justice in my opinion he also rejects the conclusion of the npp hurray but accepts the foundations of those conclusion boo johnson rightly suggests in his counter point that in that case one should also question the foundation his chapter was based solely on romans  beloved chapters but hard to develop a theology on three chapters of what paul said he also rejects a large amount of pauls writing and in response to pauls teaching in timothy about women brought up by johnson in discussion of the household codes campbell simply dismisses the letters as not from paul he does this while also making unsupported claims like junia is an apostle no mention of the large amount of linguistic research that says otherwise and phoebe is a patroness which im not sure what being a patron has to do with the topic at all as an example he says at this point it seems that we simply have to admit that pauls admonition to slaves and women in terms of hierarchical grecoroman categories are inconsistent with central christian truths that he spends much of his time advocating elsewhere consequently these texts should be reinterpretted and redeployed p  statements like these give me pause it would be hard to arrive at a holistic theology of paul when you miss the baby in the bathwater in these texts i loved this book i love the study of pauline theology this book had the perfect mixture of perspectives which were compelling and instructive in the current dialogue if youre interested in pauline theology but dont have the nerve to start the real heavy lifting four views
