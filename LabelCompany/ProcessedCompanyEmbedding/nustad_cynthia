it experience here she shares some of her ideas on what works in it dossier cynthia nustad family lives with her partner two kids ages  and  and two cats whats on your ipod most music i listen to tends to be from pandora or music services because i like the variety whats your next career step im very businessfacing i would love to see more cios including myself on public boards do you have any hobbies gardening kid and family time and pretty much all things ucla whats on your reading list my book list tends to be on innovation and inventions hometown ventura calif you started in your position in  what was your strategy for getting up to speed in a highgrowth business when the company is growing more than  my priority first and foremost was to ensure my business partners and i were aligned with where the company was going so i could bend my technology team toward that because when youre as highgrowth as we are you get in you hang on and you want to make sure that your most precious resources are tied to the most precious clients and activitieshow did you make sure you were aligned i had frequent meetings i was outwardly facing with both my internal and external clients and i had members of the technology team out with the business as we were creating new products or installing new clientshow do you ensure that meetings produce results one of the biggest things that my team is focused on now is honesty and accountability my team will share where things arent quite right and theyre making sure were set up with them in those conversations then people can decide whats the best solution moving forward what has been your biggest challenge during your first two years building out the talent on the team to overcome that i work to ensure that we have depth on the recruiting side in the personnel onboarding and training side and knowing what to look for in the next hire we do a lot of reflection on the types of candidates who are successful in our organization and therefore the types of candidates we want to go sourcewhats been your biggest technology initiative weve had two huge ones so far one of them was our data center consolidation and modernization so we have a platform thats highly flexible and scalable for our high growth and our nextgeneration big data analytics since we are a company whose entire foundation of products and services is built on data we engineered our future state with some very key technologies both have been done in the last two years both were millions of dollars in investments the challenges certainly keeping your initiatives alive while keeping the companys lights on and doors open and operational but these two strategic initiatives were very well communicated to our executive management we had a lot of buyin on the process and expectations and therefore the successes that came out of it we had a very engaged management team so they knew what our statuses were all along and what to expect from uswhats your biggest initiative moving forward one is project innovation we are in an emerging field and the more we lead the field in our data analytics the better well serve our clients at large and our company second is keeping up with our growth so making sure we have a scalable human infrastructure as well as technology and process infrastructurehow do you get value from your core it services one thing thats a key priority for me is that the executive team including some members of our board has a very educated understanding as to what were doing i make sure that i take the veil of secrecy off it and that investments are communicated at a level that anyone can understand what were doing there are key things we do to make sure of that we use our annual it vision maps its a visual image of the journey were taking as an it team that year and what goals and objectives we put forth and some key milestones the business can recognize as we achieve them we also communicate our it investments in a portfolio manner just like you would be managing your k you might finetune that portfolio we explain our it budgets in that manner and how you might want to move investments aroundwhats the value in doing that its a chance for them to help select one of the key values here is i dont hide any items in the it budget theyre all transparent and exposed as a cio you going to have risk putting them out there but you have tremendous reward in what gets fundedwhats the reward their vote their courage for funding these specific initiatives their buyin and their involvement and when executives have a voice in clear goals theres a higher chance for successhow do you make yourself a trusted partner we earn it we do what we say were going to do and if there are risks we expose and communicate them and we stand up for any mistakes we make it kind of goes back to the two key things that are important to me honesty and accountability interview by computerworld contributing writer mary k pratt

wellpointnustad holds a mba from the university of oregon and an mph and bachelor of arts from ucla    tell us a little bit about yourself our subscribers would like to know you and your business cynthia nustad i have spent my entire career in healthcare technology including time with large payers software and service vendors i am passionate about simplifying our healthcare landscape and bettering the healthcare system my company hms is the nation’s leader in coordination of benefits and program integrity services for healthcare payers our clients include health and human services programs in more than  states commercial payers including group health plans medicare advantage plans more than  medicaid managed care plans and employers the centers for medicare and medicaid services and veterans administration facilities as a result of our services our clients recovered more than  billion last year and saved billions more through theprevention of erroneous payments    you have been in the cio role since  and the healthcare industry has seen a lot during this time how has this role changed since you started and what are the top challenges you see for payer cios in coming years cynthia nustad as i become a bit reflective it is honestly quite shocking to see how much the role has changed in the nearly four years i have been at hms as a cio you lead your teams to focus on executing projects that deliver business support these have typically been infrastructurebased business enablementbased or roadmapfulfillment initiatives the areas i see our teams emerging in are much more businessstrategy related specifically recommending and presenting ma opportunities that could help fill strategic business and technology needs and finding solutions that would reach across companies or partnerships to improve efficiencies in healthcare technology teams can help address greater cost pressures in our industry and simplify the work we will see true transformation when companies and even competitors can work together to improve the whole system versus their own specific company gains    as healthcare moves towards a retail model what are the top strategies you see in the market place to drive consumer centricity cynthia nustad consumerism is certainly alive and well in healthcare  here has been tremendous investment in startup’s spinoffs and the like applying web  technologies to healthcare the past  years has seen amazing invention and this will only multiply as the pace of change quickens in the industry one strategy to deploy is to find ways to coalesce the applicationlevel simple capabilities into one common ecosystem i liken this to shared applications on a common base much like the application store on your iphoneipad i relish the day when we move beyond dozens of logins for our medical histories our eligibility and payment responsibilities doctor ratings appointments personal health data trackers logs and the like into seamless user experiences    what do you see as the role of cloud computing in the industry what is your advice to other executives on leveraging the cloud cynthia nustad the cloud is an important tool in our arsenal to manage technology and business cloud providers can help with scale they can stay on top of and supply the features and functionality needed and they can assist in offloading some of the it work so that the inhouse it teams can focus their time and energy on differentiating the products and services of their company  my advice would be to think of framing questions as a “cloud first” mentality and add external cloud vendors to the decision mix in any business or technology change  certainly companies will want to hold their proprietary intellectual property close to the vest but having partners to accelerate business strategy makes complete and good business sense    it is playing a key role in driving change in the industry how can today’s payer organizations bring it and business alignment in a dynamic environment driven by healthcare reform cynthia nustad  payers can align the team on corporate goals–especially ones that have shared visions  a great area to start with is data  data is a strategic asset where both the business and technology need alignment to farm the best value internally and even externally  today it really isn’t a themagainstus game anymore… technology is inherent in all that we do it is foundational to a business’s success  today’s business leaders have to possess technology acumen just as technology leaders must have business acumen    sometime back you had indicated that one of your top priorities would be to maintain a scalable human technology and process infrastructure nowadays finding the right skillknowledge mix is one major challenge for healthcare it how have you managed to keep your team scalable despite changing technology and business models cynthia nustad hiring retaining and growing talent is one of my top priorities and frankly in today’s market these are much harder tasks than in previous decades it professionals are in high demand but they are absolutely critical—especially to hms since technology and data are fundamental to our company strategy we employ many techniques to help us win the war for talent we like to recruit and hire staff that have a passion for doing something special in healthcare we communicate often reward and recognize and employ college recruitment programs we ensure that our existing staff has many opportunities to learn new technologies  and we pride ourselves on not being just a back office it department    social mediamobility has brought significant revolution within it in many industries how do you see the adoption of social mediamobility as playing a critical role in the payer industry how is hms planning to use this area to bring differentiation to its clients cynthia nustad because all industries have customers and all customers talk it’s clear that social media is critical for all industries some payers have been slow to recognize the opportunities presented and the challenges posed by facebook twitter linkedin and other social platforms late adopters can find themselves having no voice in conversations and that can have a negative impact through our analytics hms helps our clients marshal their data to help them make the best case on social media about how they bring value to the healthcare system    with the implementation of the aca the hie the introduction of new provider models such as aco and transition into customer centricity have all posed significant challenges to payers’ business model in your view how will big data play a critical role in helping payers create a balance among quality cost and revenue cynthia nustad hms stands at the forefront of reducing fraud waste and abuse in the healthcare system we partner with private and government healthcare payers to ensure that claims are paid appropriately last year we generated  billion in recoveries and billions more in cost avoidance savings for our clients as a result of a new focus on quality outcomes an emphasis on consumerdriven care and the advent of the affordable care act our clients are looking beyond their own data to provide the best healthcare possible while managing their costs with our  petabytes of claim and eligibility data covering one out of every three americans hms holds a unique position in the industry today we have the historic opportunity to aggregate this data – with client permission – to leverage best practices identify regional and national cost trends–and improve the healthcare system for all    what top technology trends should we be on the lookout for in the payer it industry for  cynthia nustad i see several areas gaining  momentum  leveraging big data to advance our industry  simplifying payment responsibilities  creating technology strategies to ensure our payment streams have more of a value component vs the traditional contracted rate or feeforservice  building ecosystems to knit together disparate technology assets to delight healthcare consumers  developing user experiences to engage  employees and customers and  decoupling large heritage payer computer systems into more nimble assets that can flex and change along with our industry    as you network and talk to cios from outside healthcare industries what similarities do you find cynthia nustad it seems like all my conversations with fellow cios revolve around three central tenets  the pace of change and our need to be out in front of it  leveraging our data assets strategically and  finding the talent to achieve our strategic goals    in your view what are the top challenges health plan executives must prepare for in the coming  years  cynthia nustad i see continued challenges with cost pressures health plan executives can leverage internal and externalsourced companies to help solve those issuesi would like to see more inindustry collaboration to jointly help solve problems and save costs in markets that are mature companies wouldn’t want to create duplicate fraud waste and abuse services it’s in everyone’s best interest to vet doing the work inhouse for finding solution providers to can advance your strategies at lower riski also see great opportunities as necessity is the mother of invention as the industry morphs there will be newfound partnerships business models and competitive differentiators many of the relationships may test the comfort levels of the past but new ways of partnering are needed for transformationi would also like to see boards of directors moving away from viewing it as a cost center and seeing it as a more strategic department that can provide differentiation through technology discussions    what kind of services does hms offer to the payer industry can you share a brief unique success story cynthia nustad hms provides solutions to government and commercial payers as well as employers effective algorithms differentiate our work for instance not long ago our fraud waste and abuse group flagged a home health provider who had been overpaid by the state medicaid agency for three years running the provider had incorrectly documented services miscalculated or overestimated time on timesheets missed prior authorizations and excluded proper modifiers — a claim error rate of  the extrapolated value of the overpayments was  million and that’s just one home health provider    to close time management is a critical aspect of all successful cios what top three things do you make sure are on your everyday agenda any advice on the best ways for executives to manage time and be more productive cynthia nustadyes time management is always a challenge i tend to employ several techniques that have helped over the years i hire the best and brightest to be on the team lessening the amount of oversight needed to ensure high performance i don’t agree to every meeting request that comes across the system it’s important to ferret those needed to advance versus less productive meetings i use all kinds of vehicles to communicate with my teams to ensure i reach them in ways that work best for each of them i also focus on my most important tasks when i am the most fresh and alert highproductivity times are escalators to getting a lot accomplished share tweet  share
