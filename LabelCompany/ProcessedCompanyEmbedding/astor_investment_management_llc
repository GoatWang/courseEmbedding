sectors with regards to sector fundamentals factor selection and the overall direction of the us economy in our star midyear update we seek to answer following questions how have the sector economic fundamentals evolved and how does that guide allocation so far this year why are sectors not performing in line with fundamentals why is value still underperforming growth  is the reversal expected to continue is this related to small caps underperforming largemega caps what are the implications of market uncertainty from brexit monetary policy elections etc for domestic equity the stock market appears to be placing value on the following sectors in particular energy materials utilities and industrials – laggards from last year as well as ones projected to perform well in a risk off environment however given that we are fundamentally driven our analysis believes that economic indicators are pointing toward a weaker growth environment in these particular sectors compared to others such as healthcare financials and technology our view is that there is a disconnect between the fundamentals and sector performance implying that the rally is being driven by expanding price multiples rather than economic outlook sectors ranked by composite valuation indicators as of june   the ranking shows average of ranks for estimated pe  projected year earnings growth pricebook and long term debtcapital source bloomberg factset past performance is no guarantee of future results see definitions and disclosures here for additional information   we believe that as political and economic uncertainty dissipates the riskoff trades will unwind bringing market performance in line with fundamentals which could help the following value converges in performance to historical patterns versus growth stocks large caps give way to small and midcap leadership defensive sectors flows subside  market corrects to reflect relative economic strength however as long as the external headwinds remain

investment management llc  astor insights astor insights analysis and commentary from astor investment management author archives astor investment management llc operations as a vehicle for business success posted on november   by astor investment management llc by brian durbin managing director of operations all investment advisers have an asset target in mind in order to reach that finish line you need to have a solid vehicle having a qualified portfolio manager ie the driver is a large part of the race but it is certainly harder to accomplish without efficient and effective systems and processes in place a streamlined and prepared operations department will help take you the extra mile these days there is no shortage of new regulation and technology to keep the operations departments of investment advisers on their toes in order to fluidly maneuver through a changing landscape it might be helpful to think of operations as a rally car here are five points to help visualize this reference wear protective gear race car drivers know the importance of wearing helmets and harnesses to prevent injury in the event of a crash the unexpected can happen in investment operations a technology glitch can create a trade error or an inattentive worker can input the wrong data risk controls and flags should be present in any adviser operations insurance products such as errors  omissions eo can help provide financial protection  remove unnecessary weight in order to maximize speed race cars are stripped down to be as light as possible while maintaining safety and function operations departments should be lean as well however there is a fine line too light and you might tip over if you need to adjust quickly you want to be nimble in case you need to build up the key is designing systems and processes that are easily scalable so the addition or removal of an employee group of accounts etc does not disrupt workflow inspect and know your vehicle racers know their cars inside and out similarly in investment operations a thorough review of systems and processes should be conducted at least annually dismantle each process and walk through it stepbystep to determine the weak points if you do not have the headcount to complete this review find a qualified consultant drivers may have to conduct small repairs or inspections themselves but a mechanic is often on hand as well similarly thirdparties provide additional value to the review of operations by removing bias and familiarity which can cause you to miss crucial gaps in processes by knowing where risks lie and the capabilities of the systems you will know what protective gear to use as mentioned above use a codriver rally car drivers often have a codriver sitting in the passenger seat the codriver is part navigator part handyman and part safety they counterbalance the weight distribution for investment operations compliance legal and portfolio management personnel should be integrated into operations to provide information on upcoming regulatory or industry changes that will impact operational processes given that the investment industry is everchanging being provided with information on the road ahead is valuable prepare for the conditions heavy rain mud gravel and other factors can determine the types of tires used during a race similarly different market conditions and business channels can change how an investment adviser views operations using the proper systems for the current conditions is important but preparing for upcoming changes is equally important if a driver knows the first quarter of a race is in rain but the rest will be dry the decision may be to sacrifice better rain tires due to the limited amount of time they would be needed likewise an investment adviser may forego the purchase of an order management system due to expected changes in account type eg moving from discretionary management to model delivery whether you compare operations to a rally car or construct it using another visualization the key is to see the larger picture and shape processes according to the path your business is on

investment management llc fedwatching oil prices the latest geopolitical headline all sources of anxiety some of them manufactured the real question is what should you be focusing on even as markets persist near alltime highs volatility not indicating too much concern the subconscious anxiety appears to be growing as we’ve seen in recent years and more recently during brexit any number of things can create uncertainty in the market and cause investors to make a kneejerk reaction the key is avoiding that such eventdriven market gyrations raise the questions about how investment professionals and their clients should make portfolio decisions how you construct your portfolio goes a long way in how you view market activity while there is no shortage of socalled rationale for buying and selling as the cable tv pundits will attest solid portfolio allocation decisions require equally solid rationale in other words — what are you looking at investors who don’t make investment decisions based on specific rationale are more apt to put their money on the line based on what they thinkhear or worse yet on attempts to time the market the new york times recently highlighted the potential danger of such an approach “by buying and selling too frequently and at the wrong times and not benefiting fully from compounding people typically do even worse than they would have done if they simply held on to their investments” investors get penalized for being reactionary the less fundamental and the more ad hoc their reasoning for making asset allocation decisions the more susceptible investors will be to react to market noise we believe a macroeconomicdriven asset allocation at least for a portion of portfolios ie the strategic or dynamic holdings—typically  make the most sense for investors to construct portfolios that are adaptable to the current environment while also maintaining their focus on longterm results after all corporations focus on economic trends the fed focuses on economic trends why wouldn’t investorsas a fundamentally driven asset allocation firm we’ve made our careers determining why economic data matter—what data points mean and where the economy is going our macroeconomicsbased approach is all the more important in today’s evolving capital market landscape with potentially changing risk and return dynamics from fixed income and more assumed risk in traditionally allocated portfolios as we observe in these conditions investors are taking on more risk to pursue the same return for example in today’s investment environment realistic fixedincome return targets are becoming harder to achieve without taking on more risk the choice for many investors has been to take on more risk for the same yield‘ in  a  portfolio allocation to treasury bonds would have an approximate  target return with a  standard deviation in  to have a  target return treasury bonds were reduced to  of the portfolio equities were almost twothirds of the portfolio the standard deviation for the target  return portfolio rose to more than  ‘ source  wall street journalcallan associates httponwsjcomxnvys  without a rationale grounded in the fundamentals investors potentially could make risky decisions without having a good reason—or worse decisions that are not in line with their risk tolerance which will put more emphasis on managing risk for the foreseeable future this adds more weight to have a good answer to the question what are you looking at at astor we believe the only acceptable answer is the economic fundamentals that’s what matters

number supportive of steady growth posted on august   by astor investment management llc the july employment report came in with an upside surprise— jobs created during the month which was well above expectations of  making the jobs picture even rosier was the upward revision for june to  from  strength in the labor market for june and july has helped bring people back into the workforce which kept the unemployment rate steady  average hourly earnings bumped higher by  a number supportive for consumer spending as we have said previously we expect the fed to raise rates one more time—perhaps as early as september and as we have also said given the fact that rates are essentially zero a small upward move will be of little real consequence in our opinion that said even a  basis point hike by the fed would be a vote of confidence for the us economy the astor economic index® our realtime snapshot of the us economy continues to show steady growth in the us it’s all been about jobs and just to put things in context keep in mind that this is a presidential election year no political commentary here just stating the obvious the highlights of the july jobs report showed strength in the private sector which added  jobs the public sector added  jobs while not a big number this does add a little push to the tailwind for the job sector right now other highlights from the employment report the unemployment rate stayed at  the labor force participation rate rose slightly to  from  overly the year average hourly earnings have risen by  average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by  cents to  the change in total nonfarm payroll employment for may was revised from  to  over the past  months job gains have averaged  per month sectors adding

you fear the etf” was written by ari weinberg of the wsj while i would prefer not to give this type of article any attention as that seems to be the main goal i feel like it cannot be left to exist without an industry participant’s opinion attached to it etfs are the primary investment vehicle for astor’s strategies as such we have strong opinions on the merits of using them for investment allocations mr weinberg’s main critique of etfs is centered on market action on august th the events of this day have been thoroughly covered in many articles already including several from the wsj see list at the bottom mr weinberg appears to be trying to stir up old drama by writing this several months after the fact without adding any new ideas or information to the discussion the addition of the massive image of a demonlike face staring down a small human figure on the article page only makes me shake my head to ask whether someone should fear an investment product is clearly an attempt at sensationalist journalism fear is often caused by a lack of information or uncertainty so often in history new ideas are shunned solely because information does not exist it begins a wicked cycle since there is fear there is an unwillingness to obtain more information which then reduces the chance of people becoming educated which means fear continues the better question for etfs is “do investors fully understand etfs and trading” instead of trying to instill fear mr weinberg should use his position to disseminate information to retail investors mr weinberg’s attempts to provide education are continually steamrolled by comments and selective quotes that seem to enforce an idea of etfs being an uncertain and risky investment product now on to the trading discussion what mr weinberg only passively alludes to in the following quote and subsequently seems to dismiss is that there were a variety of market wide issues that day “critics say stockmarket swings on aug  exposed the flaws in etfs they have been warning about for years proponents say etfs mostly were caught in the crossfire of marketwide trading issues that had little to do with them one thing is for sure it wasn’t the first time etfs have surprised investors” when you fully understand how etfs and markets work there is little surprise at the events of that day bank of new york mellon – nav calculation issues due to an issue with an update of sungard’s accounting system as bank of new york mellon there was an issue calculating fund navs for several days etfs and mutual funds the impact spanned nearly  funds from a variety of providers this issue only added to the day’s woes single stock pricing issues the majority of etfs that experienced disruptions on august th were domestic equity etfs due to a variety of issues with individual stocks due to the below issues it was difficult to accurately price an etf remember etfs are priced based upon underlying holdings a substantial segment of the stocks in the sp  index were not opened by the time the opening bell rang more than  stocks saw intraday moves in excess of  a number of stocks experienced trading halts during the opening minutes and throughout the day  volume of market orders according to the nyse there was an overwhelmingly larger number of market orders executed on august th than on a normal day x resting stop loss orders were triggered as prices moved down the order book selling led to more selling as triggers were eclipsed on trading systems  market maker responsibilities many people likely assume that market makers have to stand firm during volatile times and bear the brunt of risk that’s not the case by rule nyse designated market makers “dmms” need to only provide a quote for  of the trading day and the quote can be as wide as  of the national best bid and offer “nbbo”  as the paper “us equity market structure lessons from august ” from blackrock put it “this is important to note because in times of extreme stress market makers do not “support” the market they are not buyers of last resort because market makers must manage their risk and maintain adequate capital their capacity can be overwhelmed in the face of broadbased and unabated buying or selling during periods of marketwide uncertainty market makers can become risk averse” aps and other providers of liquidity are not required to be active at all times aps provide a conduit for the etf mechanism but those firms are also trying to stay in business and make money additionally the absence of prices on underlying securities creates a large barrier to the creationredemption process two of the etfs that experienced large price dislocation were aok and emqq both of these etfs typically have limited daily trading as can be seen by the  day average daily volume figuers below what these numbers mean is that there is limited natural market liquidity down the order book a single small trade could remove the entire onscreen liquidity ie current bidask volume at a set price and move down to the next price level where an order exists you could sweep the book down rather quickly and end up with trades below nav if there is no support liquid etfs will have tens of thousands of shares available in the open market at each incremental price level  you may be able to trade  shares on bidoffer or a penny downup additionally aok is an etf of etfs so if any of the underlying etfs have an issue aok surely will too ishares core conservative allocation etf aok – m in assets k shares tradedday emerging markets internet and ecommerce etf emqq m in assets k shares tradedday   while these two charts look severe during the opening period they look similar to the stock of ford f a bn company once again there were market wide issues ford f   a few statements to clarify “in normal markets etf traders who profit from zooming in and out of the etfs and their underlying holdings keep the values in line but investors have been startled to see that balance can be disrupted at times” etfs have two sources of liquidity primary market and secondary market the primary market consists of authorized participants “aps” who create and redeem shares of etfs by either purchasing the underlying basket of securities and exchanging for shares of etfs from the issuers creation or by exchanging shares of an etf for the basket of securities to unload onto the market aps seek to arbitrage any mispricing which helps to keep markets tight if underlying securities are cheap relative to the etf an ap will buy the securities and exchange for shares of the etf and vice versa the secondary market consists of shares of etfs held by investors and other parties being bought and sold between each other what mr weinberg fails to point out is the difficulty an ap would have in providing liquidity if the underlying holdings are not priced accurately or halted an etf is an investment vehicle designed to provide investor access and price discovery for groups of assets if the players on a few sports teams decide they do not want to play hard and their teams lose do you blame the idea of a team or do you focus on the underlying factors here the blame needs to shift to the underlying securities  “exchanges as well as some fund providers are examining how to prevent these rare trading anomalies meanwhile the risk that etfs may not always trade or price as expected is one that investors need to consider” mr weinberg is trying to make etfs sound scary here should investors also shun single stocks because they can be halted price incorrectly or experience other issues the bottom line is investors need to consider all investments there is a reason so many sec regulations relate to disclosure investors need to have the proper information in order to gauge whether a particular investment makes sense risk is part of the game any security can price differently than what you expect  “what matters most—and what investors should focus on—is whether a fund’s underlying portfolio fits with their goals says rick ferri the founder of portfolio solutions and long a proponent of index investing “look under the hood” he advises because many funds that seem similar really aren’t and will produce very different results from there investors can assess the product’s structure and whether the costs involved in holding or trading it are a good fit for them“ i think there needs to be a distinction here you would be hard pressed to find a passive broad indexbased etf perform materially different from another etf following the same index active etfs are a different story and should be treated as such there are etfs which may track lesserknown indices no indices or consist of holdings in other etfs and funds this statement seems to hint at a level of deception by etfs and i think that is a misleading  “etfs can be traded all day on exchanges which usually makes it easier for investors to get into or out of positions at a market price quickly except of course on days like aug ” investors were still able to trade etfs on august th except for those that were halted however as listed above a large number of single stocks were also halted once again mr weinberg is trying to isolate etfs here “as the dow jones industrial average plunged  points triggers went off for mandated halts in many stocks held by etfs as well as the etfs themselves then a number of etfs stunned investors by trading at prices far below their nav highlighting concerns that etfs might not be as easy to move in and out of at “fair” prices when markets are in disarray” etfs are by name “exchangetraded” which means if a buyer and a seller are willing to enter at a price a trade will happen if a market order is entered or a resting order is out there a trade happens regardless of where nav is mr weinberg seems to be saying here that it is “unfair” if a trade is executed below certain levels unless someone held a gun to an investors head and forced himher to enter the trade there is no fairunfairness to deliberate over financial markets can be cruel take for example the recent story of joe campbell a retail investor who shorted a highrisk biotech stock in his k etrade account only to end up with a margin call of  after the stock soared on takeover news the real issue investor education to his credit mr weinberg did include a few statements which actually describe the real issue investor education i have highlighted a few of the most appropriate quotes below meanwhile it may be more advisable than ever for investors to use limit orders—orders to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better literally putting a limit on how low the price can go “have good trading hygiene” says dave nadig director of etfs for factset “the vast majority of etfs deliver on their core promise to investors but if you trade them poorly that’s probably on you” while some advisers love that—it gives them an easy lowcost way to provide clients with exposure to certain market segments—the concern is that some lesssophisticated investors may be buying complex heavily marketed funds without fully understanding what they are getting if you don’t have the knowledge or time to build and manage a complex portfolio it may be best to stick with broadbased index etfs with significant assets and trading volume experts say and leave the niches to the pros we cannot blame an exchangetraded product for trading on exchange even if the executed price is below nav retail investors need to understand that certain periods of the day can have greater volatility and that preopen issues can cause disruption at the opening bell market orders should not be used during volatile markets additionally a more esoteric etf is no different than a single stock you have to know what you are buying and selling every available security requires research and analysis to determine the risks that is investor  material  summary we believe in the merit of etfs and do not believe the multifaceted issues of august th point to a broken product when prices of underlying securities were unavailable the etfs provided the best level of price discovery available ie what a market participant was willing to buy or sell at regardless of whether it was a resting stop loss as soon as trading resumed in a more normalized fashion pricing issues eased and prices came back in line it was a temporary disruption going forward there are questions to be answered does there need to be additional regulation to force liquidity providers to stay involved during certain periods do exchanges need to rethink regulations and processes to ensure we do not repeat the situation we had at the open i believe the events of august th have provided a painful but necessary catalyst to open further discussion etfs are still a “new” idea to many investors even though they are now over  years old however the vast majority of the etf universe has only existed since the mids or later due to the increased popularity and adoption by retail investors we need to ensure as an industry that we are providing the proper education and structure for the next phase of etf growth the influx of etfs in the past few years including the so called cringe “smart beta” etfs have provided an increased need for due diligence on behalf of investors markets which were mostly inaccessible to the majority of investors eg commodities can now be purchased with a share of an etf instead of spending several thousand dollars on initial margin for a contract of wti crude oil you can purchase a share of the united states oil fund lp uso for about  maybe that is a bad example with the recent trend in energy prices but i think you see the point on a related note since mr weinberg brought it up the rise of “roboadvisors” is less of a threat to the etf industry than it is to the investment manager industry many of the roboadvisors primarily use etfs in their models etfs are the ideal product for roboadvisors because they can provide exposure to broad asset classes with a single purchase and have advantages over mutual funds such as lower fees and intraday pricing in fact the roboadvisor industry might actually further the growth of etfs rather than challenge them as a product the example of wealthfront’s direct indexing service is the exact reason why people use etfs you need  or more to buy shares in some or all of the stocks within the available indices i am sure the required initial amount is a barrier to many investors speaking of barriers to entry the roboadvisor industry is starting to become saturated all you need is a few algorithms and you’re mostly set some firms such as schwab are cannibalizing other service channels with their robo divisions instead of generating fees from individual trades in client accounts schwab will earn its keep through the management fees on the schwab etfs used within its intelligent portfolios product investment managers like astor will need to prove our worth i would not be surprised if these roboadvisors merge with the uma and model delivery firms of the industry maybe you will see subadvised strategies on the robo platforms the real threat is to the brick and mortar financial advisor as the world moves towards a full embrace of technology i do not think the handshake and facetoface will go away as human interaction is part of our existence it will certainly be interesting to see how the rise of the roboadvisor progresses in the coming years a brief list of articles

for a positive view on the us economy   on a headline level orders rose by  from june which was revised up to a  increase from the initial report of   great news there especially considering expectations were for a  decline  if we take a deeper dive into the numbers do we still maintain our optimism below is a quick analysis spoiler alert the answer is yes excluding volatile segments – check  one of the trickiest aspects of the durable goods orders report is the inclusion of highly volatile segments such as aircraft for example the monthly change for nondefense aircraft and parts was    and  respectively for may through july when we exclude transportation new orders rose  capital goods – check  many people use new orders for core capital goods nondefense excluding air as a proxy for business investment  we saw a  rise there from a  increase in the previous month  capital goods represent items used in the production of goods and services so it represents spending for future growth additionally shipments of core capital goods rose   shipments are important as an economic gauge as they are used in the calculation of gdp with an upward revision to  for june initial  we could see a nice bump in q gdp revision to be released on thursday  in a note published this morning brian wesbury chief economist at first trust stated “plugging these and other recent data into our models we are forecasting real gdp grew at a  annual rate in q and will be up at a  annual rate in q” additional notes there is weakness yearoveryear in certain parts of the data however we must consider oil producers have buttoned up spending and production in recent quarters due to the sharp decline in oil prices and a stronger usd has impacted exports   is not  and  was not   the rate of growth in manufacturing declined for the first part of the year before finding a floor in the spring  since then we have seen an uptick  the key is we are still seeing growth above   expansion an earlier report in the month showed business inventories rose  largely in part to a  increase in the auto industry  the focus is whether sales are pacing alongside stock buildup  auto sales have been one of the brightest spots in the economy recently and since the great recession sales overall ticked up  to move the seasonally adjusted inventoriessales ratio to   this ratio has moved higher over the last year so we will keep a close watch to see if there are any signs of a slowdown in demand with backtoschool shopping largely unaccounted for in the data and strong retail sales growth  in july we could see a normalization in the ratio in the coming months  on the other hand too much inventory  and not enough demand can cause problems for subsequent quarters of growth as inventory buildup is a large factor within gdp  inventory growth added  to q gdp which helped to reduce the level of contraction to    as david ross managing director of global transportation  logistics at stifel states in a recent note “we believe we are going through a destock or rightsizing of inventories presently it appears to have begun in q and we expect it to continue through q” inventory buildup and drawdown is part of the natural ebb and flow of healthy industry  we will see how august and september set up for the q holiday shopping season summary the durable goods number from today adds more paint to the canvas that recent data for employment housing and the consumer have already put their strokes on  from where we sit the picture is appealing  it may not be a picasso or da vinci but it’s certainly no airbrush caricature from a carnival either as we discussed on monday the astor economic index® shows above average growth hopefully china greece etc do not trip and accidentally put their fists through the picture       disclosures all information contained herein is for informational purposes only this is not a solicitation to offer investment advice or services in any state where to

investment management llc bringing it back to rob stein’s  outlook report and discussion about the fed and the expected rate hike for  the possibility of this change in the rate dynamic would in his opinion and the rest of the investment committee’s introduce volatility into the market the report ended with this statement “whether the market rises by a singledigit percentage is flat for the year or even goes down  the outlook still appears positive for accretion over time – as long as abovetrend economic growth remains…” we are seeing the down  play out now markets were belligerent in their downward assault last week based on early session activity this movement appears to still have legs global selling pressure that started over a month ago has caught up to domestic markets new concerns on growth coupled with global selling have turned the focus now to the “safe haven” us stock market the last few days including this morning have made the us markets look indistinguishable from the developing and emerging nation markets half a world away  now the pundits who have been waiting to talk about a break in the dam have a clear pedestal and will no doubt make it sound extremely scary for investors who will listen to put things in perspective one week ago we were within ear shot of alltime highs in the sp  index today we are within one current trading day from a twoyear low set last october when investors were spooked october’s move ended up whipsawing many of those who panicked the october tape looked similar to  but it also felt similar as well even though there was a spike in volatility and selling pressure  was only a distant cousin to  we must be careful not to make similar comparisons to certain periods any time markets feel tired or growth feels uneven we run the risk of creating this reaction time and again if we do astor focuses on the “why” behind market behavior using economic trends as a proxy the markets behave in many ways in the shortterm over time astor believes it is the economy that determines true direction and stocks are valued due to economic signals based on recent reading as of last week the economy is still strong as such we expect this market move to be temporary even in the last two days pmi shows expansion jobless claims remain low and nonfarm payrolls are over k this scenario was not the case in  or even  see figure    below figure  ism manufacturing source bloomberg  data january  to july  figure  nonfarm payrolls source bloomberg  data january  to july  without a doubt there are concerns about emerging markets however the developed world seems to have found its footing recent economic measures in europe have even surprised higher see figure  we are seeing signs of financial stress spreading to  levels which we are monitoring closely we will also get new rounds of economic data in the next  days to help paint a more detailed view of the current environment figure  eurozone pmi source bloomberg   data august  to july  the debt crises that plagued  and  are a fraction of what they were investors overfocused on the rate move are missing the picture there corporate america the actual value of the market is as healthy as it’s been companies are hiring even though manufacturing has been a bit weaker in recent quarters than what we want it remains positive and moving forward the consumer has picked up some of the slack as seen by increasing home price indexes and home sales we do not see overheating economy an overvalued stock market an over exuberant consumerinvestor or a treacherous debt issue the signs of excess are not there expanding economies and bull markets do not typically end with a backdrop like the one we have currently although recent market action may have you believe otherwise pullbacks are part of bull markets but moves as aggressive as the past few days sometimes catch you in the frenzy of the moment as we stated before this market reminds us of  when the sp  index saw a summer through fall drawdown of approximately  due to bad news which changed sentiment equities were volatile for a time before shooting back higher with a near  rate of return in october for the sp  index  since the beginning of october  the index has returned almost  on a total return basis the stock market losses last october on hypothetical concerns were negated and appreciation resumed within a few weeks what we wrote during that period still applies now see october   – don’t panic summary the recent market move will be temporary and is not indicative of a faltering economy in fact recent data has shown the economy is holding steady and continues to growth at above average levels of growth see figure  if a comparison is to be made you should look to october  or fall  and not  the media and the strength of the selloff may sway you to believe the bull market is over but we do not believe bull markets end in this type of environment figure  astor economic index® source astor  data january

day to check in with the economy  overall we remain cautiously optimistic and hopeful for stronger growth in the second half this month’s payroll number came in at  net new jobs only slightly below its one year average of  jobs and at a pace to move the economy close to full employment at astor we had been assuming that the first quarter’s weakness – while real – should turn out to be transitory my favorite summary chart on the economy is printed below showing the level of total nonfarm payrolls and the ism manufacturing index since  source bloomberg astor calculations   i feel that as long as people are still getting jobs and the manufacturing activity as measured by the ism survey continues to expand we can hope for continued reasonably strong growth in the economy we would need to see
