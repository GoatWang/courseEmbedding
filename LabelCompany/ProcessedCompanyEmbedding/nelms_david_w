seeks opportunities for growth posted   pm et email  print  by kathy chu usa today ask david nelms the boyishlooking ceo of discover financial what gnp stands for and he laughs before answering correctly gross national product the right answer didnt always come easily during high school nelms missed out on a  college scholarship when he incorrectly defined gnp on a written test as gross national profit that experience dealt a valuable if painful life lesson its called attention to detail  says nelms  who lives in the chicago suburbs a minute drive from discovers acre campus some of the best lessons are when you get something wrong and learn from it fastforward nearly  years nelms heads a payments empire that generates about  billion in annual credit card spending employs  and boasts  million cardholders us consumers have been increasingly paying with credit and debit cards rather than cash and checks creating richer revenue streams for discover and its competitors but the industry is consolidating and discover a unit of morgan stanley is fighting larger rivals for every scrap of market share discover whose largely bluecollar brand lacks the cachet of its competitors is struggling to get its cards in the hands of more customers and to get overseas merchants to accept them nelms has been through tough challenges before in the late s the mistake he made — and learned from — was expanding discover too quickly it was  a year after nelms had jumped from mbna the credit card giant now owned by bank of america to discover as president nelms launched discovers card operations in the united kingdom introduced its platinum card and stepped up efforts to court customers through balancetransfer offers in two years the company added  billion in new credit card loans and more than  million new accounts it also boosted the number of merchants that accepted its cards to about  million us locations on par with mastercard and visa at the time today discover is accepted at  million locations compared with visas and mastercards  million locations according to nilson report an industry newsletter a few years later as the economy weakened debt chargeoffs grew peaking in  a chargeoff is considered an uncollectible loan we probably grew faster than we should have nelms acknowledges if i had to do it again i would have focused on more consistent growth thats what were doing now the company has bettered its chargeoff rate to half what it was a few years ago partly by reaching out to some customers before they fall behind on their debt discover has also forged deals with ge consumer finance to issue walmart and sams club credit cards taking advantage of recent court rulings that allowed banks to partner with discover it has moved into debitcard processing by buying the pulse electronic network and is expanding its card acceptance in asia yet discover remains an underdog in dollars spent on credit cards discover holds a modest  market share far behind american express  mastercard  and visa  according to nilson brad hintz an equity research analyst at sanford c bernstein calls discover the betamax of credit card companies like betamax the nowobsolete rival to vhs videocassettes hintz says there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the system the problem was that it was subscale in size nelms is an extremely capable credit card executive but hes been in a tough position with discover says hintz who was an executive at morgan stanley before nelms arrived and still holds an equity stake making of a businessman if pride and loyalty alone could revitalize a business nelms would have no problem closing discovers sizable gap with its competitors he is the ultimate discover cheerleader he drives a corvette with the license plate discovr the car is orange — the color on the companys credit card logo nelms also has a foot ski boat called discover though its not orange and every time i see him he has an orange tie on says david sidwell chief financial officer for morgan stanley discovers parent company hes so proud and thats what you want a company leader to be nelms knack for business was evident early the son of an engineer and an elementary school teacher he grew up in a middleclass neighborhood in st petersburg fla at  he started a lawnmowing business in high school he joined junior achievement a nonprofit that teaches business to youth and set up a stockpicking company sponsored by a brokerage firm youll see that a lot of the success he has today was because he was a very serious kid says sandy daffé president of junior achievement of chicago nelms serves with daffé on the ja chapters board even as a fulltime undergraduate at the university of florida nelms managed up to  rental properties income from real estate investments helped pay for his studies in mechanical engineering and for his graduate education at harvard business school mechanical engineering might seem like a curious major for someone who didnt plan to be an engineer but not when your father was an engineer — and you had considered your future as much as nelms had the reason i went into engineering first is you do a lot of problem solving he says you get a good analytical background whether its about constructing an organization or making a decision in investments one of discovers key problems to solve how to maximize business opportunities while being anchored to its parent morgan stanley discover doesnt control its own destiny as part of a larger financial services company especially one thats so large says david robertson publisher of nilson report last year morgan stanley announced it would spin off the discover unit a few months later it backtracked and said it planned to keep it the reversal underscores the difficulty of leading a company that must bow to the wishes of another nelms recognizes discovers limits certainly we are part of a larger firm and have to do whats right for all of morgan stanley so when youre thinking about budgets and priorities one always has to think of that sidwell says retaining the credit card issuer fits pretty well in the context of morgan stanleys strategy of being a diversified financial services firm stable credit card fee income also appealed to morgan stanley last year discover contributed about  to its parents  billion net revenue after interest and consumerloan expenses spreading discovers message in the mids discover was known for pioneering the first cashback offers and noannualfee credit cards over the years though competitors have launched a slew of similar products some more generous than discovers today nelms challenge is to grow beyond that identity of cashback and noannualfee cards to attract new customers and keep existing ones says michael auriemma president of auriemma consulting which advises discover discover has launched a marketing drive to reintroduce itself as the card company that puts you first print and tv ads urge
