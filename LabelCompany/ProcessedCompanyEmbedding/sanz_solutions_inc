sanz solutions centers include communications marketing public relations administrative accounting financial tax information technology human resources and legal services sanz solutions target market is the janitorial construction cleaning lawn care and maintenance industries because this market is primarily comprised of independent business owners and small companies who lack the resources to obtain the professional expertise and guidance necessary to ensure company growth and success industry and competition janitorial and cleaning industry the cleaning industry can be roughly divided into residential cleaning commercial janitorial services specialty cleaning and laundrydry cleaning services in  there were approximately  businesses employing about  million people the industry as a whole is very susceptible to economic downturns and suffered when revenue fell  in  and another  in  general cleaning services and particularly residential services are considered to be an expendable luxury during financial difficulties however the industry as a whole has strengthened over the past few years and in  generated  billion in revenue strong economic activity is forecast for the next  years as well and the bureau of labor statistics is predicting job growth of about  from  levels to  the industry is highly fragmented consisting of both public and private businesses and selfemployed workers the two largest players in the industry are abm industries and servicemaster a publicly traded company that owns several national franchises such as the maids international molly maid and the cleaning authority abm industries is also publicly traded but focuses more on providing integrated facility solutions to commercial and industrial markets the rest of the industry is made up primarily of small independent contractors small independent janitorial companies account for  of the cleaning contractors lawn care and maintenance industry this industry includes landscape and lawn maintenance landscape contractors landscape architects irrigation contractors and lawn and landscape product suppliers the landscape industry in the united states employs almost  million workers and generates almost  jobs in other industries the landscape services industry has annual revenues of  billion annual growth of  employs  people and represents  businesses it is estimated that the lawn care services sector alone generates about  jobs and  million in valueadded services annually in the us over the five years to  growth in the domestic housing and property markets have led to greater demand for landscaping services over the next five years steady per capita disposable income growth is projected to encourage households to continue outsourcing yard care moreover general economic recovery will likely boost commercial expansion driving the need for industry operators that can maintain large corporate and resort campuses however this industry is highly fragmented and the top  lawn care services companies generate about  of the total revenue in the industry and the remaining  percent of the lawn care  landscaping industry is driven by small business owners challenges to small businesses competing in service industries the janitorial industry and the lawn care industry are both service oriented industries that are overwhelmingly comprised of small independently owned small businesses small businesses in the service industry face specific challenges which attribute to nearly half of all new companies failing within the first year and  within five years lack of proper tools and resources to handle these challenges results in the average cleaning company losing up to  of their customer base every year due to poor service many small business owners face unsurmountable difficulties and challenges as they pursue their business model such times when these entrepreneurs need expert advice guidance and assistance from business professionals they lack the resources to engage the help required without proper guidance access to best practices and proper information these owners struggle or completely fail in these industries a majority are run by less than  employees and require the owner to focus on areas outside of their scope of expertise and away from areas that promote growth and customer retention time management one of the largest factor contributing to the downfall of a small business is the lack of time management small business owners perform several tasks that can take up time on their daily schedule entrepreneurs often find it difficult to balance a schedule that includes sales and marketing activities the search for financing product development accounts payable accounts receivable and business development generally these items are not the entrepreneurs strongest skill sets and as such take the owner longer to complete and are done without the care and diligence of a professional in that field if a small business owner is unable to hire help in these areas it can be difficult to give every aspect of the business the attention it requires employee training  turnover small operators also suffer from employee turnover and poor staff training poor staff training is especially damaging to this industry as customer service and retention is key to success training and ongoing training are crucial in order for a cleaning company to survive and thrive however high employee turnover creates an ongoing obstacle to proper staff training small businesses struggle to attract and keep top talent that can help them move ahead employment packages that include health benefits vacation days sick days and profit sharing are common with larger corporations small businesses have a problem competing with these kinds of employment benefits higher wages from larger corporations also attract employees away from small businesses and make it difficult for small businesses to reduce employee turnover accounts receivable small businesses in the service industry are also susceptible to accounts receivable delays that can cripple the company if not handled properly many of these businesses lack the resources to offer advanced technology payment solutions or a dedicated accounts receivable department to ensure proper and timely payment needed to maintain cash flow slow collections can be detrimental to the continued operations of a small service business the service industry is especially vulnerable to this area as the company typically outlays the cost for the service  ie the labor and supplies and does not collect until after the job is complete small businesses must pay for the labor costs and supplies to complete a job even if the client does not small businesses can run out of capital very quickly if finances are not budgeted properly and if clients delay payment marketing marketing and advertising are an important way for any business to reach new clients and with a limited marketing budget it can be a struggle for a small business to reach its target audience advertising can be expensive and even with the many forms of free marketing available on the internet social networking websites blogs company websites it is still difficult to reach a target audience without investing in other forms of marketing such as television and print many small business owners also lack the knowledge or skill to manage online technology and do not have the resources to hire web professionals to maintain a company website social marketing and search engine optimizationseo access to new technology when new technology is introduced it can be expensive to implement a small business may not have the financial or technological resources to take advantage of new technology that a larger company may have and this puts the small business at a distinct disadvantage in the marketplace sanz solutions shared services centers sanz solutions will establish shared service centers that
