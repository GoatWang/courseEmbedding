a little nugget every investor learns eventually talented people create wealth and talent is an asset that never really goes into a bear market it’s always valuableas the longterm investment performance of seacor holdings nyseckh  demonstrates very clearly a couple of months ago when ckh was trading in the mids i recommended the stock to the subscribers of capital  crisis my reasoning was very simple seacor holdings is a great company that’s run by a very talented investorand its stock was quite cheap the stock isn’t as cheap anymore it is up about  since my recommendation after taking into account the special  dividend but seacor is still a great company that’s still run by a very talented investor his name is charles fabrikant and he has compounded capital at a  clip since  the sp  by contrast has delivered  he also pens as good as an annual letter as one will find on either side of the mississippi but let’s start at the beginning about  years ago fabrikant was one of a group of investors looking to buy a shipping business they took over nicor marine and adopted the name seacor “primarily because it was less costly to paint over two letters than the entire name” fabrikant writes seacor soon spread into a variety of businesses out of “a conviction that if opportunity knocks we should open the door” today seacor owns and operates barges tankers work boats and helicopters about half of the business is the legacy offshore marine services business this division mainly serves the offshore oil and gas industry the other businesses do all kinds of things seacor’s helicopters work in oil and gas medical emergencies firefighting and much more its cargo ships support us inland waterways its boats also work in environmental cleanups such as the mess in the gulf of mexico these are a few of seacor’s profitable hobbies what seacor really is though is an opportunistic asset manager fabrikant says seacor “is not just a boat company or an energy service company our asset base is diverse and our horizon is broader than simply owning and operating equipment we are a custodian of capital and our mission is to use our expertise and knowledge to make money” in short seacor is a “go anywhere” investor just in the last handful of years seacor has established ventures in argentina to operate barges and ships in brazil to operate helicopters and in china to sell business jets and helicopters fabrikant is also adamant about having a diverse collection of businesses “i realize that some investors may not like mixed drinks” he writes “but this philosophy of diversity is core to our business strategy” it’s served seacor well it has never – not even once – reported a loss for any year in its history fabrikant also lays out many wise nuggets in his letters i wish more corporate executives thought like he does – and were also owners of the enterprises they manage “capital like assets needs to be deployed and priced to replacement cost” fabrikant deals in tangible assets and thinks in terms of “replacement cost” this kind of analysis asks “what does it cost to build an asset from scratch” by this way of thinking an asset is cheap only if you can buy it for less than you can build it a man who thinks this way will not lose money over his career and so fabrikant does not automatically employ seacor’s cash flow toward new boats helicopters and the like in recent years he’s bought back a lot of stock this year alone seacor bought back  million shares at about  per share since  he’s retired  of the shares when seacor’s stock price is below book fabrikant is a buyer “we manage for longterm appreciation in book value not yeartoyear earnings” i love it fabrikant doesn’t play to wall street it’s probably why only one analyst – from barclays – covers the stock as long as you can buy the stock below book value i think you’re getting a good deal current book value is  per share that book value is firm seacor depreciates its assets more quickly than industry peers seacor has also demonstrated an ability to sell assets for more than book value and anyway as long as fabrikant can continue to do what he has done since  – which is compound book value at a  clip – then this should prove a nice longterm investment you can play around with numbers and see how this might look in three years if book value continues to compound at  a year for the next three years then book value per share will be  even a modest  premium to book would take the stock to  per share importantly the executives and directors own  of the company fabrikant is the largest shareholder among these with  so his interests are aligned directly with the common shareholder everyone’s portfolio should have some room for a steady grinder like seacor you can’t own only the rabbits well you could but you’d need a lot of antacid seacor is a sleepwellatnight investment regards chris mayer for the daily reckoning the wonderful world of charles fabrikant

sharetweetpin itsubmit charles fabrikant letter to seacor holdings stockholders for the first quarter ended march st  ht value investing world dear fellow stockholder the year in review financial highlights seacor holdings inc “seacor” produced  million of profit a  return on stockholders’ equity of  million and  diluted earnings per share this compares with last year’s profit of  million a  return on stockholders’ equity of  million adjusted for the spinoff of era and  diluted earnings per share in  seacor “pocketed” earned  million from its share of income before depreciation amortization including net deferred gains from sales of equipment and deferred taxes this  million accounts for cash interest payments and taxes currently owed we subscribe to the oldfashioned precept that “cash is king” even in a world in which it earns almost nothing in the bank a highlight of the year was teaming up with avista capital partners “avista” a private equity fund to create seavista avista invested approximately  million of cash for a  noncontrolling interest in our seven usflag jones act tankers four owned and three leased and newbuild contracts for three usflag product tankers we also committed to building a chemicalpetroleum articulated tugbarge “atb” adding an additional  million to capital expenditures for the shipping group at yearend our forward capital expenditures totaled  million for all our business units seacor holdings – year perspective seacor marked its th year in business this past december the seacor of today is an evolution of an opportunistic “leveraged buyout” of a local gulf of mexico business that operated supply vessels in the united states and a few small tenders in nigeria conditions in the oil patch were difficult and the outlook then not unlike that of today was uncertain and sentiment negative the industry had plunged into an abyss in  and there was no “app” for calculating how long it would take to climb out the offshore vessel sector was struggling with significant excess capacity eager investors subsidized by tax incentives and captivated by a good “story” and ambitious operators desirous of expanding their fleets had binged on work boats anticipating a surge in activity following the commercialization of north sea oil and the deregulation of natural gas prices in the united states and a multifold increase in the oil price in the wake of the regime change in iran even interest rates ranging from  failed to deter investment from  seacor’s best opportunities were to buy secondhand offshore vessels via discrete equipment purchases or in bulk via corporate acquisitions the latter added value by producing operational efficiencies seacor was an “early mover” in the consolidation of the industry five transactions were key in consolidating the standby safety sector in the north sea and the offshore vessel markets in west africa and the gulf of mexico they also transformed seacor into a global business with a diverse fleet in the late s daylight arrived and the sun warmed up the oil patch by  opportunities for consolidating combinations and purchases of secondhand assets at compelling prices had become scarce offshore vessels were starting to earn money investors took notice “bulking up” became “trendy” and prices for secondhand assets improved seacor reversed its strategy shed secondhand assets and focused its efforts on designing and building next generation equipment to meet the push into deeper waters and more distant frontiers we also used some of the proceeds of our sales and our profits to embark on a path of diversification redirecting capital into asset classes other than conventional offshore vessels struck us as more productive than marking time until values for boats fell to attractive levels our first excursion involved building jackup drilling rigs investments in drycargo barges and helicopters both depressed asset classes soon followed during the last  years in addition to helicopters barges and rigs seacor has invested in international dry cargo ships aviation services an alcohol production facility oil storage terminal grain elevators a technology concept that was a first mover in providing email service to ships and offshore vessels not a winner a specialized emergency response service and public equities and debt as surrogates for assets we have also run a specialized leasing business that has financed disparate assets such as coal washing plants oxygen tanks for hospitals and reconnaissance aircraft used on missions above my clearance i wish i could say all of these investments were successful of course i cannot some have produced at best mediocre returns and some resulted in losses fortunately some have also produced outstanding returns for several the jury is still out the verdict will be rendered when the assets are sold or scrapped seacor today has four main business segments offshore marine services inland river services shipping services and illinois corn processing an alcohol production facility their activities are described in our  k and were also narrated in last year’s letter to stockholders see

charles fabrikant discusses the modern shipping industry – gcaptain gcaptainmaritime news from boom to bust and back charles fabrikant discusses the modern shipping industry june   by gcaptain charles fabrikant executive chairman seacor holdings image marine money charles fabrikant executive chairman of seacor holdings discusses the ups and downs of the shipping industry during the past  years at marine money  in new york city many would say that one of the lessons of history is we do not learn the opposite view however is that put forward by a friend with whom i recently had dinner i asked what accounted for his extraordinary success in characteristic laconic style he mumbled “good decisions” hungry for insight i pressed him asking how he came to have made so many good decisions during his career again with typical brevity he answered “experience” of course i was eager to know how one gets relevant experience so i persisted and posed the obvious question the rejoinder was both somber and sobering “bad decisions” most of you are familiar with the standard exculpatory catchall invoked in documents promulgated by public companies ring fencing “forward looking statements” i need to exonerate my memory so i will claim my rights as a senior citizen and request any lapse in recollection mistakes in recounted details or revisionist history about the shipping business or my career not be held against me all of us in this room know that shipping is “a cycle” we also know that booms end and busts do not persist forever  during my almost  years in the shipping business there have been three turbocharged cycles the  hostilities in the middle east had caused a boom in shipping but by the time i became involved in our family business in december  freight rates had receded handysize tankers were fetching world scale  slightly above running costs then about  per day for operations based in greece i had bagged ws  for a crossmed voyage pretty good for a reformed lawyer my immersion course began two months later in midfebruary  rates jumped  overnight  this was a dramatic lesson in cause and effect and the impact of relative currency values on prices of commodities and ships in february  the era of fixed exchange rates ended commodity prices and ship values were cut loose from the firm mooring that had tied them to the us dollar  of course market dynamics supply of vessels relative to demand are the primary drivers of freight rates and ship values however currencies are an everpresent backdrop by september  tanker rates had soared to unprecedented levels prices of vessels had climbed five fold a secondhand  ton vessel the jeanine – a five or sixyearold turbine tanker was making the rounds in february  for about  million it changed hands in september or october  for about  million parenthetically this increase in value was almost as meteoric as the sevenfold increase in secondhand values that occurred during world war i from  one and twoyear old vessels were commanding prices higher than the cost of new construction and of course the price for new vessels was climbing another lesson beware of inverted yield curves in shipping as in financial markets an inverted yield curve flashes an amber light in october of  i attended a conference hosted by chase bank then a major lender to the shipping industry… respected commentators and chase’s chief shipping economist were forecasting a shortage of tankers this forecast was delivered with charts and graphs and firm conviction the firm conviction dismissed the order book that had grown steadily since  and perhaps more significantly a much higher price for oil than anticipated when the orders were placed the prevailing wisdom of  was us oil imports would continue to grow geometrically and the shortfall for our refineries would be satisfied by crude oil making the  plus day voyage from the middle east of course the future proved otherwise  by  tankers dotted the harbor in piraeus and were parked in the norwegian fjords high oil prices took their toll on the us and global economy  inflation was accelerating but ship prices were plummeting to make matters worse for tanker owners mexico alaska and the north sea altered the tonmile equation the nail in the coffin was the imposition of mileage standards for new cars whose impact hit the market in the ’s and for those who may not remember these regulations were sponsored by a republican administration except for the brief boomlet caused by the turmoil in iran – sadly also the impetus for additional orders for tankers – that sector from  was a barren desert in  a gradual market recovery got underway the second turbocharged shipping market during my career was the dry cargo boom of the late ’s charter rates for bulk carriers in  were barely above breakeven from  time charter rates tripled since rates were barely above breakeven at the trough operating profit increased parabolically as always ship values followed what factors gave rise to this bounty port congestion in nigeria which was spending dollars coming from the oil boom failed crops in russia a surging economy in japan and a weakening us dollar commodity prices climbed hoarding and accumulating inventory vacuumed ships from the spot market  the prestigious magazine foreign affairs ran an article with the catchy title “green gold” optimists were predicting that china’s swelling population would consume more protein necessitating more grain to feed livestock pessimists were predicting that the soviet union would forever be doomed to poor harvests because of problematic weather and farmers who were unmotivated by the collective system of agriculture of course history again played a cruel trick the dry cargo fleet had expanded in the latter part of the ’s in part based on orders by japanese industrial companies placed to service the export juggernaut in part because owners converted orders for tankers to dry cargo attempting to salvage value from deposits placed earlier in the decade for hulls that would deliver into a poor market as with tankers in the ’s there was a followon blow the early ’s introduced new fuelefficient diesel engines korea also made its debut on the ship building scene in the late ’s  deadweight product carriers were offered for slightly over  million dollars quite expensive when compared to today’s prices for larger vessels of the same class the ’s as most everyone knows were the dark age of shipping not only did freight rates languish but prices for assets were punished by rising interest rates and competition from new building for those who may think that ships are a fortress of value in times of inflation i suggest think again although rising interest rates are usually a precursor or coincident factor in improving economic activity and demand for freight they are also competition for capital i can think of no worse investment than an asset that lacks pricing power to increase its current income production at a time of accelerating inflation that is causing interest rates to climb the third meteoric rise in shipping rates and ship values and the longest sustained period of good times in my life was the boom that began in the first half of the last decade and crested in  shipping enjoyed the perfect storm during the dark ages shipyards had closed by the late ’s most european shipyards had closed their doors except for those building offshore vessels in  the financial meltdown in asia inflated the value of the us dollar and shipyard prices reflected levels not seen in quite some number of years the economies of asia recovered led by china which was devouring raw materials particularly coal and iron ore after the shock of  the dollar began a multiyear descent to lower valuations relative to all the major currencies that were not pegged to it the yen the euro the won even the rmb immediately prior to the  financial meltdown it took  dollars to buy one euro dollar interest rates suppressed for many years because of the longterm capital crisis the millennium scare and  tragedy had started to climb although at a modest pace compared to the ’s i won’t review the history of the last five years i doubt there are many in this room who are so new to the industry that the period from  would be other than current events of course opportunity is about the future and the past is history i have questions but sadly no answers what will be the impact of shale oil production and apparent increasing supply of natural gas on crude oil demand and product movements can these phenomena yet to be confirmed as longterm factors influence total demand and the ton mile equation what is the impact of the global “green” movement america is ratcheting up mileage standards moreover a gallon of gasoline pumped into our cars is typically only  percent petroleumbased what will be the impact of a bigger panama canal in my career the suez canal was the wild card would it be open or closed the obvious impact of the new panama canal configuration is on container movements but could it be a factor in the coal or iron ore trades is iron ore the petroleum story of the current decade its price rise is not unlike that of oil in the ’s and the brazilianaustralian oligopoly is reminiscent of opec’s tight control oversupply until new sources of oil started to be economical thanks to the higher price and new technology could venezuelan ore and colombian coal transiting an enlarged canal be the equivalent of the new sources of crude oil in the ’s that reduced ton miles could the tonnage of iron ore and coal required to build out china and india prove less than expected due to progress in metallurgy are the capes of today the vlccs of the ’s  cheap in comparison to peak prices but condemned to a long period of oversupply those who purchased ships in the dog days of  suffered with poor freight markets but by  picked up a tailwind of declining interest rates do today’s speculators face a headwind of increasing interest rates that will partially negate benefits to asset values from earnings coming from improving freight markets could the combination of excess shipbuilding capacity with a stable or stronger dollar the lure of improved fuel economy and desire to meet new regulations cause more tonnage to crowd into markets that are already suffering from overcapacity finally how will higher interest rates at some time inevitable influence relative ship values will savings in fuel be worth less as a present value discounted by interest rates that are higher than inflation will middle age vessels be more attractive than newer and more costly ships that have to carry the burden of higher interest rates i wish i had answers to the foregoing questions after  years in this fascinating business i tend to revert to paraphrasing a fairly wellknown remark by a former justice of the us supreme court who was
