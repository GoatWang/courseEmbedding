employersponsored plan like a k is the primary retirement savings vehicle for many people however it’s rare for an online advisor to manage them most deal exclusively with individual retirement accounts and taxable accounts the field isn’t completely without competition though it’s close vanguard personal advisor services and personal capital both offer k guidance but not direct management blooom excels in its ability to manage any k no matter where the account holder works or where the account is held there’s no need for your employer to have a partnership with the service no account minimum beginner savers can have bloom manage their accounts right from the start giving them a better shot at getting off on the right foot free analysis anyone can connect and analyze a k for free a process that’s about as painless as it gets you create a blooom account and link your k by selecting your provider and logging in on blooom’s site using a flower as a symbol of your k’s health the company shows how your existing allocation is faring and suggests ways to improve it at that point doityourselfers could easily take those recommendations and change their asset allocations on their own investors who want help can sign up for management with blooom which includes rebalancing every  days blooom sends its customers an email notification each time it makes an adjustment investment expense audit employer plans generally offer limited investment options many of which carry higherthanaverage fees blooom works within the investments available in the account by classifying each fund option into one of  categories then the company’s algorithm selects the fund in each bucket with the lowest internal expense ratio although there are many instances when there’s only one fund in each category — and as such no way to lower expenses — this method can help investors lower their expenses overall while maintaining an appropriate asset allocation and diversification financial advisors we ding any company that doesn’t have direct phone support for its customers but if that doesn’t matter to you you’ll be happy with blooom’s email and chat support which includes access to financial advisors the company says these advisors are available to answer any financial planning question including questions that fall outside of k management — things like debt repayment budgeting and preparing for major life events cost there’s something to be said for blooom’s clean flat monthly fee investors know exactly how much they’re paying and the fee is charged to a credit or debit card rather than being skimmed from the account balance but there’s a downside to flat fees too in order to compare costs with other advisory services both robo and human it’s important to evaluate that fee as a percentage of the assets under management here are a few examples of blooom’s pricing at various account levels account balancefee as percentage of assets per year      blooom says its median account balance is  —  a month on that balance works out to an annual fee of  for comparison human advisors typically charge around  of assets under management and roboadvisors typically range from  to  given that blooom is one of the few roboadvisors that manages ks and that the company offers customers access to financial advisors we think that’s a reasonable charge where blooom falls short limited investor assessment the company signup process which involves linking your k account by signing in with your user name and password is straightforward but it may not be comprehensive enough from an investing standpoint the questions that determine how blooom allocates your assets don’t delve any deeper than your birthday and target retirement age and no mention is made of risk tolerance or investment goals some of that can be explained by the company’s focus on employer retirement plans it rightly assumes that the goal of every client is retirement however investors of every age vary in their risk tolerance and that should be considered blooom says that many investors aren’t confident in their risk tolerance and that the company’s streamlined application makes the service more appealing aggressive allocation for the sake of testing several nerdwallet staffers — ranging in age though all under  — linked their k accounts to blooom all were given the same asset allocation recommendation of  exposure to stocks bloom says its algorithm tends to favor equities until the investor is roughly  years from retirement many investors would consider this too aggressive few people have the stomach for this strategy even with an investment manager like blooom watching their backs investors who don’t agree with the allocation that blooom recommends can change it by simply moving a slider during the signup process is blooom right for you blooom earns four stars from nerdwallet because it brings muchneeded investment management to employersponsored retirement plans which are usually the primary retirement vehicle for those who have them few other roboadvisors have tapped this market and those that have either require high account minimums or don’t provide the kind of comprehensive management that blooom offers if you’re looking for a roboadvisor for your k blooom is the best option but before signing up do the math to figure out what percentage of assets you’ll pay based on your account balance and how that will change as your balance grows you can cancel the service at any time and it’s easy to do because your k remains where it is investors can also test
