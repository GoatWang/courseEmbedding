dec  reuters  two hedge fund veterans who worked at sac capital advisors lp and pequot capital management long considered among the industrys most successful are launching their own firm next month people familiar with the matter said on monday larry foley who had been a senior portfolio manager at sac from  to  and paul farrell a member of pequots executive committee and coportfolio manager of its scout fund group plan to open bronson point partners on january   foley and farrells pedigree will likely prompt many hedge fund industry investors to give the pair a close look but how much money the men will actually manage to raise remains unclear at a time when investors are becoming ever pickier about where they commit their capital to woo potential clients bronson points principals said they have committed at least  million of their own money and promise a disciplined approach to fundraising organic growth and risk management they will concentrate on us stocks running a socalled

hundreds of millions of dollars quickly analysts said it will be harder for newcomers now investors want more details about how people who break off from huge firms will run their own often a difficult task when they have been used to working with a team of risk managers lawyers and marketers analysts also noted concerns about pequots history after its founder arthur samberg surprised investors and employees by shutting down the firm in may after regulators reopened a probe into possible insider trading sac capital advisors manages  billion and has scored an average annual return of  percent since its launch in  the returns have stirred envy on wall street and speculation about how its founder steven a cohen managed to deliver such consistently strong returns for so long
