into the incredibly uncomplicated business of timber dan newman tmfhellonewman jan   at pm hiking through a forest may be the last thing you think about when it comes to investments the woods are probably the place you go to for a break from the financial and technologically driven world but then those green leaves shimmering in the sunlight start to remind you of money and you wonder perhaps if the forest is the perfect place to invest after all  is timber a good investment lets cut through the underbrush to find out timber marketthere are a dizzying number of wood products so lets take a view from the canopy to get a grasp on the market source unece timber committee th session october  softwood a majority of the wood consumed is from conifers such as pine trees this type of wood is typically used for structural roles in construction hardwoods such as oak trees are consumed far less and are usually used for flooring furniture and the more finished aspects of housing wood of course also is used to make newsprint and paper measured in metric tons us newsprint consumption has fallen from  million metric tons in  to just  million in  while other us paper consumption has fallen from  million metric tons to  million the metric most timber analysts keep their eye on is housing starts more housing construction means more demand and housing starts have started to rebound from their recessionary lows us housing starts data by ycharts and with housing trending up timber stocks have followed wy total return price data by ycharts longterm global forecasts from the campbell groups timber trends newsletter a great resource for following the timber industry highlight asia as the largest consumer of pulpwood fiber within five years while brazil china and russia will produce the greatest share of new output currently china imports  of its softwood from canada and the united states in addition biomass as an energy source could drive growth for wood pellets and wood energy chips especially in asia the merits of biomass as a clean energy source are debated especially versus coal but as it is renewable countries can use it to meet renewableenergy goals for example south korea hopes to power  of its needs through renewable energy by  from  in  and use  million tons of pellets by  versus less than a few hundred thousand tons used in  what to look for in companiesif things appear at least cyclically green for the timber industry what should an investor look for in a company  really the same things in any good company good management prudent investments and a healthy balance sheet good management will ensure that equipment will be kept up that trees will be around to cut and that there will be money to invest in new land machinery and labor  specific to the timber industry the basics include where a company owns land and the breakdown of its revenue from different sectors for example weyerhauser nysewy owns nearly  million acres in oregon and washington giving it easier access to the chinese market potlatch nasdaqpch meanwhile has  acres in idaho making any potential trip for its logs to china a bit more costly some companies such as pope resources nasdaqpope are more exposed to timber and real estate than the likes of rayonier nyseryn which earns more of its revenue from its performance fibers segment that it sells to manufacturers of a variety of goods from diapers and paint to pharmaceuticals and digital displays companytimberlandswood productscellulosereal estate weyerhauser     potlatch     pope      rayonier      plum creek nysepcl     source companies most recent ks or qs in addition many of the public timber companies are organized as reits a designation that gives the companies a special tax status and requires that they pay out at least  of earnings as dividends as a result dividend yields are usually attractive for the industry if youd rather not bet on a single company there are a few timberbased
