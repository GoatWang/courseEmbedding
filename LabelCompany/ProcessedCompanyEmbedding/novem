work out it has a good amount of beta alanine and creatine that you need pre work out for endurance and strength however on the pump side it is lacking a little this is ok because novem is currently getting blown out for the up coming psycho pre work out and you can buy a ingredient like agmatine to throw in to the pre work out for cheap overall good product just needs a little more for the pump

height  weight  lbs view progress verified buyer scivation novem pryces rating  this stuff basically screwed up my workouts when i started taking it every few months ill switch up preworkouts just to see whats out there and unfortunately i came across scivation novem seeing it with such high ratings figuring id give it a try i was highly disappointed all i had was a gritty unsteady jittery feeling with a super crash the type of energy it gave me was me feeling  off not knowing what to do with myself with the annoyance of no strength made me totally weak i didnt get this product for pumps obviously bc its clearly just an energy supplement but it is not the clean energy i expected thumbs down i threw the last half of the bottle away this stuff is crap oct   like  full details report

scivation novem degglers rating  i have used a heap of preworkout supps over the last  months and had to keep changing because i never felt energized i know that it was doing all the nice science stuff that was improving my workout but that wasnt enough for me i needed to feel that rush closest i ever came to that before was c and i used to do  scoops of that one anyways i got novum and recommended i try half a scoop first i knew i had a high tolerance so i went for  scoop instead not expecting much it was like i had been hit by a lightning bolt energy levels were off the charts and all i wanted to do was lift the  mins i had to wait for my partner were insane and then i had one of the best leg days of my life try it it is amazing aug   like  full details report mikep height

provider offering a complete range of rehabilitation and home care products novem started as a wholesaler in this area it was then housed in a small shop house at foch road singapore equipped with a small goods van that delivers goods to hospital pharmacies at short notice the sincerity and commitment with which we respond to customers’ needs soon earned us a good name the homecare range was
