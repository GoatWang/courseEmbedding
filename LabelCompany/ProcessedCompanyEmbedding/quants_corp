methods it allows you to revaluate the inventory by specifying a new unit cost or by specifying the change in the overall inventory value which will adjust the corresponding unit cost in moving average costing method the new average cost is computed and updated in the productas eric suggested for real costing method user can select the quants to be revaluated based on a date range and then

citemidcalvkzedcqfglkstfwnepuagqpbchuqypbkwmfatxclwmailgmailcom typecite dear accounting experts were addressing the topic of inventory revaluation that is you dont like the value of a product eg obsolescence solve issues in valuation wrong po price etc and you need to change it in odoo you are offered the option to change the standard price of the product and under real time valuation this produces a corresponding inventory posting entries but since odoo manages quants and each quant keeps its purchase cost and hopefully manufacture cost in we can add support for that soon the standard price field in the product is irrelevant as a stored field because should really be the result of the cost of the quants  under the fifo costing the price of the product to be shown would be the cost of the first quant for that product in reality odoo is using fifo costing method because it considers the cost of the quant to generate the accounting entries in stock moves if you are to undergo an inventory revaluation wouldnt you need then to revaluate the quants and not the product standard prices revaluating a quant would as a consequence generate the corresponding accounting entries for inventory revaluation regards  jordi ballester alomar founder  eficent    jordiballestereficentcom  httpwwweficentcom twitter httpstwittercomjbeficenterp
