ca plex simon williams went on to develop the associative model of data and to found lazysoft technologyedit as early as  synon pioneered the approach to development which in early  became known as architected rapid application development arad such tools use abstract patterns as building blocks to automatically generate the components of an application in synon developers use a specialized language to define an applications data model and the rules that ensure its integrity they then select from a set of around  prebuilt program design templates which perform edit display and print functions in full screen multiline and transaction full screen header above a multiline detail modes developers may further specialise the procedural logic of the selected templates and link templates together by using action diagrams the tool then automatically instantiates the specialized templates over the data model and generates highlevel language code in rpg or cobol without any further developer intervention it also generates the sql or dds code to define the necessary database tables and views synon kept precise productivity metrics during the internal development of its sma accounting system in total  days of effort were expended on development and qa over a month period which resulted in the creation of  million lines of hll code excluding comments in  programs this is equivalent to the production of  lines of fully tested and documented code per person per day the allin fully loaded cost including management design and enduser documentation was £ per program synon was also ahead of its time by adopting a strictly object oriented approach to the programs that it generated for instance programmers could not use native hll commands to operate on database tables instead all physical database creates changes and retrievals were encapsulated within individual templates which were in turn evoked by generated programs thus programs could be automatically regenerated with no manual intervention following changes to the structure of the database in  ca introduced an addon tool to ca e called web option which allows e customers to webenable their existing applications and to run those applications which were originally designed for an ibm greenscreen inside a standard web browser obsydian follows the same general principles as synon with the important exception that developers can create and reuse their own abstract design templates the ca plex toolset also operates web and clientserver applications and generates in c c java rpgiii and
