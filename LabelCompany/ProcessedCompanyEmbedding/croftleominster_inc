february   kent croft president of croftleominster and cio of the croft fundsrussell croft vice president of croftleominster and portfolio manager of the croft funds managers commentary  agriculture commentary investment opportunity agriculture commentary  q  increasing demand for food and a finite supply of land will create pressures leading to investment opportunities over the longterm farmers will be asked to reap more from their limited raw resources and will need to improve land productivity demand for products including agriculture equipment irrigation systems seeds and fertilizers should lead to many years of growth this growth will be somewhat independent of other macroeconomic drivers and can act as a hedge from more volatile economic cycles demand growth more omnivorous mouths to feed global food consumption is driven at its core by world population growth the world’s population exceeded  billion in  and baseline estimates released by the un suggest it will grow approximately  percent to  billion by  or  percent annually while a sub percent annual growth rate in the key driver of additional food demand does not by itself offer a compelling argument for large consumption increases a confluence of other factors could drive a consumption growth of  percent from  to  according to jp morgan china’s consumption of major crops grew  percent annually from  to  despite total population growth of roughly  percent during the same time period wealth gains made possible by economic advancements in developing markets with relatively large populations will cause an outward shift of the demand curve for all sources of foods furthermore as economies develop dietary regimens shift toward a higher intake of proteins and they consume more meat a multiplier effect occurs on agriculture demand because significantly more crops are needed as feed in order to produce meat for human consumption the water footprint network estimates that one pound of beef requires roughly  pounds of grain for feed while a pound of pork and a pound of chicken require roughly  and  pounds respectively  biofuels food vs fuel demand for agriculture products is not only increasing as a source of food but also as a source of energy the higher cost of fossil fuels and desire for energy independence have driven significant research into generating energy from renewable sources one of which is biofuels these can be derived from many sources such as corn sugar timber and grass as well as vegetable oils and animal fats specifically referred to as “biodiesels” the use of biofuels for energy and heat has experienced only modest penetration rates thus far yet ethanol still managed to account for nearly  percent of the us corn crop in  us government mandates have driven adoption of ethanolgasoline blends which has made corn roughly  percent of the annual domestic fuel supply the us represents roughly  percent of the world’s total ethanol production while brazil is the other large player with about  percent share other nations have been slower to adopt biofuels as a cheaper fuel solution for various reasons but in a  report the international energy agency iea estimated that biofuels have the potential to account for  percent of the world’s demand for transportation fuels by  while this target may be ambitious there are real implications on food prices if significant growth in biofuel demand materializes worldwide over the next few decades  supply constraints doing less… while incremental demand growth appears virtually certain crop supply growth has plateaued over the past decade with further gains appearing difficult to achieve limited supply of arable land capable of producing crops remains the primary supply growth inhibitor outside of subsaharan africa there is little remaining uncultivated land and what remains is rife with various issues that will continue to hold back agricultural development  these include water scarcity environmental concerns and a lack of transportation infrastructure furthermore huge yield gains of roughly  percent on a per acre basis over the past  years because of the use of advanced fertilizers and agricultural technology leave very little in terms of lowhanging fruit worldwide annual grain productivity gains have fallen from  percent in  to below  percent in recent years the chart below shows that wheat yields have been flat for over a decade in germany france and the uk while japanese rice yields have barely grown over the past  years   …with lessproduction growth is not only being squeezed by limited land and productivity growth but also by poor farming practices that have reduced the amount of favorable farmland via erosion and topsoil loss onethird of the world’s farmland is at least moderatelydegraded due to dustbowls in important producing regions in china and africa  topsoil is disappearing at five times the replacement rate in australia  times in the us and up to  times in china extreme weather has been a nearterm issue that has created even more pressure on worldwide supplies drought conditions prevail in  percent of the contiguous us and la niña patterns have created droughts across south america meanwhile floods in australia have pressured recent wheat output and generally warmer temperatures have hurt yields worldwide for the  crop year these factors have resulted in significant reductions to expected ending grain stocks this level is now expected to fall below the  crop year a time of record high prices water an inflationary inputbeyond the supply dynamics mentioned above water is a major input in all types of agriculture representing roughly  percent of the world’s freshwater usage annually usage is growing along with crop demand because of similar socioeconomic forces  however freshwater represents only about  percent of the total worldwide water supply and this ratio is moving in the wrong direction underground aquifers used mainly for agricultural purposes are being depleted in excess of replacement in many areas water shortages due to pollution poor infrastructure inefficient farming practices and other factors are driving  percent average annual price increases in a commodity that was previously for all intents and purposes considered a common good with a virtually unlimited supply pricing pressure has been exacerbated by the multiplicative effects of the higher protein consumption trend not only does it require larger amounts of grain as feed to produce meat for human consumption but the increased water requirements are just as staggering a pound of beef requires roughly  gallons of water to reach the dinner table while wheat is the most waterintensive major crop at roughly  gallons per pound investment opportunities companies who benefit the economic implications of higher crop prices are vast and create an investable trend over the longterm we believe that names directly exposed to the agriculture market stand to benefit significantly from secularly higher crop demand on the back of rising crop prices during the past few years farmer incomes have nearly doubled and their balance sheets are in the best shape ever during the past half century according to the agriculture department farmers should generate a net income of over  billion in  the highest level since  when adjusting for inflation the kansas city fed said in november of  that farmland prices were up nearly  percent yearoveryear for the third quarter hitting alltime records in a multitude of midwest states such as iowa and minnesota among others excellent farmer finances combined with the need to grow production and squeeze out further productivity gains should spur investments in farm equipment irrigation systems advanced fertilizers and other agriculture technology deere  co should continue to see robust demand for its farming equipment that can provide large production gains trimble navigation offers farmers technology that can collect and analyze data which they can use to automate processes and increase their overall efficiency in the fertilizer space companies such as the mosaic co and potash corp should benefit from increased demand for their yieldincreasing products monsanto company’s genetically engineered seeds allow farmers to plant in more areas and lengthen the planting season fmc corp should see continued demand for their herbicides insecticides and fungicides which are all important contributors to crop yields valmont industries is a leader in irrigation equipment with a presence in international markets where penetration is low valmont can help solve many of the aforementioned problems by offering better water efficiency increased yields and a reduction in erosion and topsoil lossthe destructive destabilization of crop inflation the societal implications of higher crop prices are quite sobering across the world rising costs will be passed through to consumers who will see more of their disposable income eaten up at the grocery store or market in developed markets the growth of processed food highly efficient supply chains and competition between grocery stores restaurants etc will help limit the effect on the end user in developing markets however rising crop prices could drive large increases in food costs and lead to geopolitical instability food accounts for roughly  percent of the budgets of more developed nations versus greater than  percent for emerging countries not coincidentally when the food and agriculture organization fao food price index spikes above  as it did in  and  we see a significant increase in riots and civil unrest during the  crisis food prices spiked on a confluence of many of the factors mentioned above causing unrest in countries across asia and africa in  rising food costs were a major factor in setting off the arab spring which caused riots across the middle east and the demise of regimes in egypt yemen tunisia and libya such turmoil could derail economic advancement in these fragile nations and limit overall global gdp growth longterm threats and opportunities food demand per capita is growing along with the world’s population yet there will be no concurrent growth in either the earth’s size or raw resources unless investments are made to both increase the productivity and maintain the supply of land there will be serious worldwide consequences and potentially crippling socioeconomic instability providers of solutions that help farmers economically and efficiently attain these goals are attractive investments on a longterm horizon the inelastic nature of food demand should drive increased use of these companies’ products and services under various macroeconomic conditions leading to less correlation and volatility versus the general equity indices over timerisks to our thesis on food demand growth include slower worldwide population and gdp growth especially in emerging economies an end or reduction of ethanol mandates would likely diminish overall demand for corn and create downward pressure on crop prices also a long period of favorable weather could lead to significant oversupply of crops which would depress prices and limit farmer investments information in this commentary regarding market or economic trends or the factors influencing historical or future
