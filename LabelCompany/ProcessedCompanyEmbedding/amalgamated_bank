city new york united states wwwamalgamatedbankcom about amalgamated bank amalgamated bank has always been a different kind of bank founded in  by the amalgamated clothing workers of america a textile union of mostly immigrants in new york city amalgamated bank became the first financial institution for the working class in a time when banking solely benefited corporations and the wealthy amalgamated pioneered free savings accounts free checking accounts unsecured credit affordable housing loans and second chance bank accounts for those people who had credit problems in the past since then the bank has grown to serve those who help make the world more just compassionate and sustainable their extensive experience financial resources and community of likeminded customers offers labor unions philanthropies political campaigns socially and environmentally responsible corporations as well as individuals a unique set of financial services enabling them to lead the charge to improve our communities and our country it’s this commitment to working people and the organizations that support them that continues to set them apart from other banks b corp certification provided us with a unique opportunity to join a community of likeminded organizations who hold themselves to a higher standard of good governance and corporate transparency much of what we do is guided by the desire to be the bank of the progressive community and by being held to the b corps standard we’re putting our money where our mouth is inherent in our mission is the goal of building a more equitable global culture in which corporations seek to benefit every person the change we seek® amalgamated bank wants to open the world to mission based banking where you put your money matters and if you value the environment a fair minimum wage human rights and corporate governance your bank should share those values too often consumers choose their banks based on convenience of location infinitesimal differences in interest rates and fees as the banking landscape continues to change it’s time to instead base those decisions off what really matters providing sound banking services and banking on values need not be mutually exclusive ideologies through the creation of innovative products and services they have the ability to help grow their clients capital and business while making the world a
