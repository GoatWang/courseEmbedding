second i walked in the store i was greeted with a welcome to ulta even though the cashiers were busy two in particular stacy a quiet tall person and emily shorter dark hair were extremely friendly and helped me find a new mascara i absolutely adore as well as a few other things the store still has a tendency to be a little confusing at times unfortunately but i know its not the fault of the people therethe best person there was a quieter girl unfortunately i cant remember her name at the moment im sure itll come back to me later who worked as the skin therapist emily directed me to her at one point when i asked her a question about skin care products and im honestly so glad i got the chance to talk to this wonderful girl she smiled and asked me what i was looking for before making recommendations most of which i was unsure about until she started explaining the benefits and differences of each one she even asked me about what i am using at home to see if there was anything i should change about my routinei eventually decided to get the  microzone she recommended theyre like minifacials and have discovered that it was not only more than i expected but well worth every penny spent and more i have never felt my skin so soft and smooth before and in only  minutes i made another appointment with her in just another couple of weeks and will definitely be keeping ithair

to do is apologize that i was late and see when is the next best time she can fit me in after all she is running business and we need to show here professional respect and show up on time at best we should call and let her know your running behind and ask what is the next timeslot she has open that why we both come out happyive never had an issues since i show up early i dont like making wait on

world the meaning of customer service is poor at best and you have to do all the work just to get things done in a timely manner but you guys answered all my questions in a timely manner and kept me informed with regards to scheduled tasks that pertained to the project and gave me a great looking roof as well overall i enjoyed working with your company and would highly recommend you to all who where in the market for a roof replacement so thanks to you tyler and quality roofing for a job well done and feel free to utilize me as a reference for your future customers if you so desiretexas showcase roofingkmartin ratedexcellent customer servicei knew i had hail damage but knew nothing about the claims process the owner mr vasquez explained the whole claims process to me and handled everything he was present while the insurance adjuster inspected my roof and made sure that i got my roof bought including the gutters windows and siding he even pointed out city code upgrades that i needed done such as metal drip edge installation when the work started his crew was on time and got everything done including the cleanup in one day i was amazed at their skill and knowledge of roofing not only were they professional but their pricing was very fair i highly recommend austin roof repair co to anyone needing roof work austin massage clinicjesse c ratedbarbara was amazing i reluctantly made an appointment after my chiropractor told me that my issue was muscular and i should schedule a massage i arrived and met barbara she is such an awesome person she made me feel very comfortable and we discussed what was bothering me and how she was going to go about treating my shoulder it was one of the most amazing things i have ever experienced and i know that sounds nuts she fixed my shoulder pain and over the next couple days it was completely gone had another appointment with her yesterday to help my other shoulder and it was wonderful i absolutely recommend barbara she is a huge blessing to our communityblonde faith salonme m ratedi went in as a natural dark blonde and made it clear i wanted to be a light blonde i came out with my hair barely lightened due to the fact there was not enough heat on my hair  it cost over  that included a trim  for highlights  for a trim thats the most money ive ever paid in my life im  years old so thats a lot of hair jobs this

good job a good price and a good experiencequality austin roofing services deliver on all three i appreciated the expertise they brought to the job by conducting a thorough walk through complete with digital photos and careful explanation of what they would do it was also refreshing to see that they just doesnt quote the work  they do it as well they were very professional and met our needs at a reasonable and fair price while im not looking forward to the next time i need roofing services i know who ill call when that happensfaye hair design incsarahpmpro ratedfay had cut my hair today i lfay had cut my hair today i love my haircut it’s beautiful when i wear my hair curly it’s perfect amp when i pressed it my last haircut was seven months ago maybe longer i have thick curly hair i do like to wear my hair curly amp smooth press i had haircuts were if i wear it press smooth you can see mistakes the stylist had made i truly hate that when it happeneds which is why i waited so longshe understood curly hair shrinks when dry so she took caution to cut less so when my hair is dry the length will be what i want as well thank you fay for listening amp the haircut hailey design salonfudy ratedi walked in with bad hair and i walked in with bad hair and came out with a great new haircut fariba has been at the recently reopened shop for about  months and she is fabulous she examined my bad haircut and she listened to what i wanted as she worked she explained what she was doing and asked for my feedback fariba kept saying she does not speak english very well but i totally disagree she is amazing the price was inexpensive for a shampoo and cut i didnt request styling so do not feel i can give the  star rating ill definitely return and also plan to take my dad next time
