roumeliotis min readtony james president of the blackstone group arrives as a panel member for the breakout session at the clinton global initiative  cgi in new york september  shannon stapletonnew york reuters  blackstone group lp has reached out to its biggest fund investors about investing in a new investment vehicle with a longer investment horizon than the typical year private equity fund according to people familiar with the matter dubbed core private equity this vehicle would invest in slowergrowing but safer companies use less debt in buyouts and charge investors lower fees than most private equity funds these people said blackstone is seeking as much as  billion apiece from five to six of its biggest public pension fund and sovereign wealth fund investors for the strategy the people said     aspects of the strategy including the exact fees and holding periods for investments are still being worked out these people said they added that the idea is still at an exploratory stage and may not take off     a blackstone spokesman declined to comment the biggest investors in blackstones funds include the california public employees retirement system the new jersey state investment council and china investment corp     the move underscores how blackstone is looking to boost its valuation as a publicly listed company by managing more permanent capital and further diversifying its model of buying and selling companies blackstone is already the worlds largest alternative asset manager with  billion in assets under management as of the end of september spanning private equity real estate credit and funds of hedge funds a higher stock valuation would benefit blackstone shareholders of whom the companys employees form the largest group chief executive stephen schwarzman is the biggest holder by far owning about a fifth of the firm in  schwarzman collected  million from dividends from his blackstone shares     the new strategy also would help blackstone address what has been a frustration for some buyout firms and a source of envy when they compare their investment vehicles with warren buffetts berkshire hathaway inc in this vehicle blackstone would not be forced to sell successful companies too soon because the fund is running out of time most private equity investors however also known as limited partners prefer the traditional buyouts because they deliver high annualized returns the prospect of lower returns may not be an easy sell     the fact that investors will pay lower fees is positive but the question is whether the net returns will still be high enough to justify investing in such a product as opposed to publicly listed stocks said steven kaplan a university of chicago finance professor whose research focuses on private equity        in june at blackstones annual shareholder meeting president tony james acknowledged that the core private equity model would have challenges limited partners in its funds would likely say no to the prospect of a  percent to  percent return for a highquality company when they can get  percent to  percent for private equity james said but he added that there could be ways around that     the core model approach has already been applied to some alternative asset classes core real estate for example involves investing in safer longlease assets with less debt rather than riskier fixerupper properties     blackstone based in new york began investing in what it calls coreplus real estate this year through separately managed investor accounts before combining them into a comingled fund blackstone is embarking on its core private equity initiative also through separately managed accounts the people said     a few firms such as general atlantic llc and golden gate capital have also raised socalled evergreen or perpetual funds to invest in private equity but they target the higher returns that blackstones traditional private equity business does     first pitch blackstone which does not want to abandon its established private equity business has had to look at a differentiated core strategy to avoid conflicts with its traditional private equity funds the sources said     the firm first made its pitch on the new strategy to investors last summer at its annual limited partner summit in a confidential presentation a copy of which was seen by reuters     limited partners were told a year core private equity fund could deliver  times the profit on capital invested in succession over the same period in three conventional private equity funds the example assumes a  percent internal rate of return for a core private equity fund and  percent irr for a traditional fund     this is because only up to twothirds of the capital committed to a traditional private equity fund is invested at any one time limited partners were told as against that blackstone would invest the entire capital raised in a core private equity in onego the costs of buying and selling companies also add up over time according to the presentation     the popularity of the strategy may come down to the fees investors are charged     while these have not been decided
