documentsquestions one should ask a lawyer before hiring themto ensure you find a competent attorney who wont abuse your trust or drain your finances you have to make the proper inquiries there are several questions you should ask but the majority will fall under three general topicstraining and experience questions one of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorneys history when you first step into a lawyers office you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas you have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practices success look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of courtonce you inquire about the broad details of their legal career you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her experience you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistantfind out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour many civil lawyers work on contingency whatever the payment plan make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performancelawyerclient relationship questions when you hire a lawyer youre agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time you need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship the attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updatesyou should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyerclient relationship great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle the more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs the bettertop reasons to hire a lawyeryou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an

infodidnt find what you were looking formagnifying glasshelpful reviews ward law officesdean h ratedi personally had dennis phelps legal assistance when i was involved in a workplace injury in the beginning the insurance adjuster seemed like they were looking out for my best interest but that soon changed when i asked about getting a second opinion from a doctor of my choosing soon after my weekly benefits were cut off because of the doctor theyinsurance company sent me to said something other than what the doctor i went to for a second opinion said i immediately hired dennis phelps as my work comp attorney the power trip was over for the insurance company adjuster weekly benefits were reinstated and recommendations from that second opinion were followed through on over the four years i underwent several surgeries and numerous procedures but if i had a question and called or emailed mr phelps he would always respond back within a few hours i am very grateful for mr phelps attentive advice and support he provided to our family during this lengthy process he was able to negotiate the maximum award amount for my injury which has helped greatly if you get injured at work dont hesitate give dennis phelps a call he is very professional and will get you the correct medical treatment and benefits you deserve along with the maximum settlement in the endrocky wiechman lawmisty r ratedthings didnt work out but rocky let us switch most of our retainer to another attorney so that was nice overall communication was poor and i never received an invoice with hours rocky didnt go see my brother his client in jail to let him know what was going on with his case until i called the office to let him go from our council it was a whole week before rocky spoke with his client i thought that was odd but maybe he is just too busy in my opinion dont take cases you dont have time for i cannot say how he is with other clients it was a hassle to get a hold of rocky too he never answered is never in the office and never replied to my emails he made my family and i feel like we were bothering him i think that when youre paying for a job you should be reassured about whats going on with a loved one and you should never be made to feel like you are bothering the person youve contracted regardless i am happy he was a decent person and gave back  of the  retainer we put down even though he didnt speak to my brother his client once about his case the whole month and a half we had contracted him cummings nika a jbfulton ratedi was having a tough time last year after losing my job and ended up being charged with dui afterdeciding to drive to see a girl after hanging downtown i thought i was fine i only had a couple drinks but ended up being pulled over i blew   give me a break i had to spend the whole night in jail with people that were absolutely hammered – a homeless guy literally puked since id been looking for a new job the last thing i needed was a dui on my record a friend recommended bill so i set up a meeting it didnt cost anything to just go talk to him which i really liked since it took the initial pressure off i dont know if i would have been as likely to go if i knew it was going to cost me i had to give up my license for a month instead of a year and he got me a diversion so my record stayed clean my bill was about half of what i was led to expect from my friend – so i dont know if my case went more smoothly or hes just gotten quickerbetter all in all thanks to bill it wasnt nearly as bad as i thought it would be minus the night in jail with that disgusting homeless guylazzo markhannabanana ratedi really tried my hardest to avoid filing bankruptcy i spent more on my credit cards than i should have in college expecting the job market to improve later when i graduated but had to seek help when i finally realized i was in over my head i guess i chose mr lazzo because his office is closer to where i live than most of the attorneys in town and i didnt want to have to mess with frequently commuting downtown i dont think i was in as much debt as many that decide to go the bankruptcy route but i needed help nonetheless he handled everything extremely well and now i can finally start over im very glad i chose mark law office of tammy martincheryl j ratedi have seen tammy twice the first time nearly  years ago and again just this week she was both times very helpful knowledgeable courteous and friendly caring efficient timely with services needed and fees for services rendered were extremely reasonable she met with me and my two witnesses at a nursing home so my brother did not have to leave his room to sign the forms needed both episodes of services needed were absolutely positive and i would not hesitate one second to seek further legal help from tammy martin thank you again tammyarif haeri llp law officesgayle s ratedi know of five people that have used this attorney for their bankruptcies

under three general topicstraining and experience questions one of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorneys history when you first step into a lawyers office you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas you have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practices success look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of courtonce you inquire about the broad details of their legal career you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her experience you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistantfind out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour many civil lawyers work on contingency whatever the payment plan make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performancelawyerclient relationship questions when you hire a lawyer youre agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time you need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship the attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updatesyou should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the
