   mgb thin film investors support fabrication of magnesium diboride mgb thin films at sti since the discovery of superconductivity in mgb there has been marked progress in the ability to grow thin films of this material by the techniques of pulsed laser deposition molecular beam epitaxy and hybrid physical chemical vapor deposition however the efficacy of most of these methods is deleteriously affected by the particular challenges of mgb film growth meaning they must employ suboptimal growth temperatures or undesirable ex situ or in situ annealing procedures numerous difficulties thus remain regarding the routine deposition of completely in situ smooth robust highquality films which are useful for applications in addition the deposition method should also be compatible with multilayer deposition doublesided deposition and the growth of films on largearea substrates of technological interest sti has developed a patented growth technique for mgb thin films which offers several advantages over existing methods and is the first deposition method to enable the production of highquality mgb films for realworld applications sti films possess among the highest tc values and lowest resistivity values reported the tc values of our mgb films are  to  k on par with the bulk value the transition to the superconducting state is sharp with widths îtc of  k these observations indicate that the films are clean films grown by our technique also have outstanding rf properties the surface resistance rs  values of our films are among the lowest reported in the literature our growth method enables fabrication of highquality films on a number of different substrates including singlecrystal rplane sapphire cplane sapphire mplane sapphire hsic mgo laalo  ndgao

will enable a significant size reduction for the motors with higher efficiency one potential sweetspot for highpowered superconducting generators is expected to be  megawatt offshore wind turbines offshore superconducting wind turbines promise to capture clean energy at a lower cost than competing renewables while delivering power directly to growing coastal cities superconducting wind turbines are expected to play a unique role offshore since conventional technology cannot achieve the âpower per towerâ requirement although initial costs for large offshore turbines are higher due to the

superconductor technologies inc awarded us patent for hts wire manufacturing system nasdaqscon english français register sign in superconductor technologies inc awarded us patent for hts wire manufacturing system february    et  source superconductor technologies inc – increases ip portfolio for its conductus wire manufacturing – austin texas feb   globe newswire  superconductor technologies inc sti nasdaqscon was awarded a us patent for a key aspect of the rcecdr system architecture used in manufacturing conductus® hts wire this invention enables sti to efficiently monitor the evaporation conditions of multiple source materials used in the vacuum deposition chamber during the hts growth process us patent no  entitled “reactor device with removable deposition monitor” from the us patent and trademark office uspto protects the system design developed by sti to improve monitoring efficiency when evaporating materials in vacuum this type of automated machine architecture utilized within the reactive coevaporation rce chamber enables improved cycle time higher throughput and lower costs “this patent reinforces the sustainable production advantages of our hts wire manufacturing process” stated jeff quiram stis president and ceo “we design our systems to simplify the manufacturing process which allow us to increase efficiency and reduce cycle time one of the key advantages of our method is the utilization of removable monitoring tools that enable us to evaluate material evaporation status without disrupting the production process in addition to saving time this design reduces maintenance and cleaning requirements our team continues to develop and implement trade secrets that improve the economics of our conductus wire and improve our commercialscale capacity” reactive coevaporation and cyclic deposition reaction rcecdr the rcecdr process grows a rare earth barium copper oxide rebco superconductor film onto a flexible template this process requires accurate temperature uniform pressure precise ratios of elements and the presence of oxidizing atmospheres to grow high performance superconducting materials the rcecdr system is scaled for large batch operation to insure every portion of superconducting wire has uniform material properties sti’s rcecdr process yields very high quality superconducting wire to maximize current carrying performance about superconductor technologies inc stisuperconductor technologies inc is a global leader in superconducting innovation its conductus® superconducting wire platform offers high performance costeffective and scalable superconducting wire with  times the current carrying capacity of conventional copper and aluminum superconducting wire offers zero resistance with extreme high current density this provides a significant benefit for electric power transmission and also enables much smaller or more powerful magnets for motors generators energy storage and medical equipment since  sti has led innovation in hts materials developing more than  patents as well as proprietary trade secrets and manufacturing expertise for more than  years sti utilized its unique hts manufacturing process for solutions to maximize capacity utilization and coverage for tier  telecommunications operators headquartered in austin tx superconductor technologies incs common stock is

business that are not historical facts are forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties forwardlooking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are inherently subject to uncertainties and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements these factors and uncertainties include but are not limited to our limited cash and a history of losses our need to materially grow our revenues from commercial operations andor to raise additional capital which financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all in the very near future before cash reserves are depleted which reserves are expected to be sufficient into the first quarter of  to implement our current business plan and maintain our viability the performance and use of our equipment to produce wire in accordance with our timetable overcoming technical challenges in attaining milestones to develop and manufacture commercial lengths of our hts wire the possibility of delays in customer evaluation and acceptance of our hts wire the limited number of potential customers and customer pressures on the selling prices of our products the limited number of suppliers for some of our components and our hts wire there being no significant backlog from quarter to quarter our market being characterized by rapidly advancing technology the impact of competitive products technologies and pricing manufacturing capacity constraints and difficulties the impact of any financing activity on the level of our stock price the dilutive impact of any issuances of securities to raise capital the steps required to maintain the listing of our common stock with a us national securities exchange and the impact on the liquidity and trading price of our common stock if we fail to maintain such listing the cost and uncertainty from compliance with environmental regulations and local regional and national and international economic conditions and events and the impact they may have on us and our customers forwardlooking statements can be affected by many other factors including those described in the business and managements discussion and
