main content start video overlay close video overlay turn captions on   show transcript end video overlay by carlo frappolli head of talent at jpmorgan chase head of talent at jpmorgan chase friday september   text size a a a the abilities of people with disabilities i was born in  to a big loving italian family in the finger lakes area of ny state  my brother joe was born in   joe was born with an extra chromosome  technically giving him a disability known as down syndrome  my grandparents immigrated to the us from italy and had no formal schooling my parents were not educated past high school  they had the wisdom though to view joes extra chromosome as a gift never once describing it to any of his five siblings as a disability  being only two years older than joe we grew up together and did everything together i simply looked at joe as my sibling my playmate my bunk bedsharing roommate  not as my sibling “with a disability” while he may not have been able to do all of the physical and mental things i could do i learned so much from joe about humility respect forgiveness resiliency being positive … i could go on and on  but let me share joes abilities some of which i attribute to his extra chromosomehis gift as my mom and dad described it ability to provide perspective joe has been my sounding board for as long as i can remember when i started to feel others had more than us when we were kids joe would remind me that no one had more love than the frappollis and what more could we want  when i thought calculus was going to ruin my life at cornell university a phone call to joe assured me my life would survive calculus  when i was stressed about leaving corporate life to go make baseball cards for a living joe said you love baseball why wouldn’t you do that joe is a calming voice of reason in this crazy world in which we live ability to connect  inspire everyone who meets joe feels better about themselves and leaves with a brighter outlook on their day  i cant explain it have pondered it for years and now just simply accept it  he draws people to him connects in a deep and personal way and somehow inspires them to see the best rather than focus on the struggles  we should all be so gifted ability to innovate joe works fulltime for gw lisk an engineering and manufacturing company that makes solenoids valves sensors for all different types of industries  joe has a quality assurance job  he checks components to ensure they are working properly prior to distribution  the machine he works on allows him to test two components at a time  he thought it was moving too slowly  he drew a picture of how the machine could be easily changed to test three components at a time  the supervisor was impressed brought joes picture to engineering and the machines have now been retrofitted per joes hand drawing abilities in the workplace when i entered the workforce in human resources i never considered a person with a disability to be any less qualified for employment my perspective has always been to figure out what job might fit that person best just as we would do for all employees or candidates joe was my lens into disabilities and taught me to look deeper and see the gift that each person has to offer i am especially proud to work at jpmorgan chase where we are committed to hiring and developing individuals with disabilities and provide an opportunity for all of us to be engaged in this space via the accessability business resource group i started the midwest chapter years ago and saw an immediate impact as managers became more aware and more engaged with our new office of disability inclusion the firm is putting even more resources behind this community i encourage everyone here to get involved—it will help make our great firm an even better place the lessons i’ve learned from my brother should serve as a lesson for us all — that people with disabilities can add as much value at work as anyone elseand

nonprofit how four bankers helped launch a chicago nonprofit jpmorgan chase service corps program uses employee expertise to support local efforts to create jobs and invest in the community when tony chopp landed in chicago for his jpmorgan chase  service corps experience what struck him most about the city was its rich history unlike his native and sprawling las vegas chicago is a city steeped in centuries of history a blanket of tightly connected neighborhoods that span  square miles the service corps program at jpmorgan chase sends top employees from around the world to work with nonprofits in various cities it is part of the company’s broader approach to corporate responsibility – which combines philanthropic investments with the skills and expertise of its employees they share otherwise costly expert advice on ways to increase the power of the nonprofits’ community impact together tony and his jpmorgan chase colleagues – the global service corps team lucy brash from the corporate investment bank cib equity and capital markets in new york city james tung from asset management in taipei and rajpal gahlaut from cib banking operations in mumbai  would be working to support an organization in one of chicago’s underserved communities dr bryon brazier a wellknown woodlawn community advocate speaks to tony and the service corps team about the history and vision of woodlawn their destination woodlawn a south side underserved neighborhood that borders the affluent hyde park home to the elite university of chicago there he and three service corps teammates would be partnered with bsd building self determination a social enterprise aiming to generate revenue for its parent nonprofit the arthur m brazier foundation ambf the starting point for their work would be creating an expansion strategy with accompanying financial forecasts through job training and certifications in robotics bsd’s goal is to provide valuable wellpaying hightech jobs for  of woodlawn’s residents each year they plan to train and hire employees from their neighborhood to work in their manufacturing facility that makes biodegradable plastic cutlery revenues from cutlery sales will pour back into their parent nonprofit ambf which then plans to inject these new funds back into the woodlawn community bsd industries resident engineer trista bonds is teaching tony how to move a axis industrial robot these machines will be used to train woodlawn community members to ready them with skills for highquality and indemand jobs however upon arrival at bsd the team quickly realized that there was a gap between initial project expectations and bsd’s current business position before they could help bsd expand and improve operations they needed to ready them to launch their yettobegin operations this would require pivoting their focus to critical sales goal setting financial planning and risk analysis to make that happen we quickly realized that we were essentially working with a nonprofit in startup mode shared chopp we underestimated what they needed from us most – financial modeling knowledge and plans for driving revenue this led tony and his team to regroup they had to assess how their skill sets could best help bsd achieve its launch goals and ultimately bring jobs and revenue to its local community it was humbling watching their scope of work shift dramatically during those first few days as they gained an understanding of bsd they dug in meeting with bsd’s two fulltime employees to get the information they needed to unearth where they could truly make an impact we weren’t going to walk away chopp declared this was an organization with two fulltime employees wearing  hats each there were four of us and we were going to figure this out tony center surrounded by his jpmorgan chase service corps team and client trista while brash went to work on developing bsd’s financial model tony and his other two teammates explored how they could lend value given the organization had already raised a significant portion of money through grants and local fundraising tony and his team wanted to make sure that money would last this led tony to explore the cost of materials they’d be using to create their cutlery the original price  per pound “that wasn’t going to give them the kind of margin they needed to be sustainable” said chopp the service corps analyzed many of the potential partners and price points associated with bsd industries production of plastic cutlery he made a few phone calls bringing his daytoday procurement skills from chase to the table chopp quickly identified a viable alternative primary material and negotiated the materials price down to  per pound – a staggering  savings while a small win for someone like chopp this was a huge win for bsd giving them even greater longevity for their hardearned grant funds over three weeks tony and his teammates worked to deliver a comprehensive set of recommendations that would empower bsd to raise awareness in the community maximize use of their grant money until they could produce revenue and professionally market their highimpact community initiatives rajpal tony james and lucy work on finalizing their deliverables to bsd industries getting ready to finish their three week assignment the entire experience brought chopp back to thinking about his problemsolving experiences in the marine corps and the different ways he’s been trained to work with people through his years with chase “in the marines i oversaw logistics you got an order you made it happen” said chopp “yet with community programs and volunteerism – much like business – it’s all about soft skills” chopp credits his year tenure with chase for developing those soft peoplecentric skills that made his time with bsd so rewarding “my evaluations with chase have forced me to look at how i work with people ask more questions figure out the ‘whys’” chopp shared “those questions and ‘whys’ really gave us an edge in helping get bsd on a path that would make them both profitable and sustainable” chicago service corps team members tony and lucy listen to dr byron brazier from the brazier foundations and project executive mentor commercial bank cfo marcus von kapff discuss the bsd industry project and brazier foundation’s work in chicago now this woodlawncentric program could move forward with confidence – financially and logistically – bringing both sustainable jobs and revenue to their local community and with a business model that wouldn’t burn through their grant money before they could begin generating revenue the chicago service corps team program representative and jpmorgan chase  co executive sponsors gather after the team’s kickoff event for a final picture before splitting off into project teams and beginning the work with local organizations as chopp looked back on his experience he said the impact of their work really hit home when he recently summed up his service corps mission and work with not only his project team of four but larger full cohort of sixteen to a group of fellow chase employees “i realized that i couldn’t do justice to what we’d accomplished for bsd in a fiveminute presentation” chopp confided “not only was i proud of the work we had done but i was inspired by how many fellow chase employees came up to me after my presentation and asked for more details i think that speaks to the impact we have as an organization not only do i have the camaraderie built with my  service corp colleagues but the work we did travels with us from community to community that’s exciting” read more on how skilled volunteering is helping nonprofits increase their impact see how we are helping detroit nonprofits ﻿ related

chicago neighborhood of woodlawn she was happy to find a vacant twofamily brick home within walking distance of both her job and her sons high school tate recently purchased the property with the help of a local homebuyer assistance program and plans to live in the buildings firstfloor unit while renting out the other one she hopes to move in within a few months but for now shes looking forward to fixing up the place it just needs some tender love and care the yearold university of chicago police officer said the home buyer program benefiting tate is one of many community revitalization efforts funded by pro neighborhoods a  million fiveyear initiative by jpmorgan chase  co to help bring economic opportunity to distressed neighborhoods across the country one component of pro neighborhoods work entails commissioning research that identifies challenges facing various communities in an effort to arm local community development financial institutions cdfis as they form collaboratives to tackle those challenges in chicago that meant working to improve the crumbling housing stock in the citys less affluent neighborhoods the chicago collaborative a partnership consisting of three cdfis seeks to address the issue by providing capital to wouldbe homeowners and investors on the condition that they rehabilitate properties to meet the collaboratives high standards woodlawn with its convenient location near the university of chicago as well as the affluent neighborhood of hyde park was a perfect target for the program according to jack crane the director of lending at community investment corporation cic one of the chicago collaborative groups what youve had in woodlawn is either vacant or mismanaged apartment buildings and literally hundreds of vacant or buildings in poor condition but given its location it really doesnt make sense crane said theres a tremendous opportunity there to attract the people who work in hyde park and at the university using pro neighborhoods funds cic purchased  properties in the neighborhood with the intention of reselling them to chicagoarea residents who work nearby keona is one of their first homebuyers  the first they hope of many good food close to home while good housing is key to any vibrant community another staple is equally important  access to food yet many communities qualify as food deserts  areas where grocery stores selling fresh healthy produce and other essential items are hard to come by in communities across the county the pro neighborhoodsbacked refresh is working to change that one of their first success stories bringing a rural colorado grocery store back to life fort market is the largest grocery store in costilla county one of colorados poorest areas for the countys residents the closest alternative to fort market is up to  miles awayand yet many have been making that drive because until recently fort market was on the ropes high energy bills caused by outdated equipment left the grocery store with little capital to adequately stock its shelves without outside intervention the store would have likely closed down this past summer fortunately for fort market and costilla county residents refresh partners the reinvestment fund and the colorado enterprise fund had identified the community as a prime candidate for help colorado enterprise fund stepped in with a loan that didnt just stop the store from closing  its clearing the way for major improvements fort market is now working to beef up its inventory to bring customers back into the fold theyll be able to come and get all their shopping needs done said anne misak colorado enterprise funds healthy food program manager just as important fort market is also upgrading its freezer and refrigeration equipment in order to cut down on energy usage and slash its electricity bills while pro neighborhoods’ funding helped cover the loans underwriting and closing costs its also funding staff positions  including misaks  that allow the cdfis to take a handson approach to guiding stores like fort market into a selfsustaining business model we can provide extra support to some of these stores and business owners who really need that extra help we have the time to do follow up calls and follow up visits misak said were really making sure theyre getting what they need to be able to grow and be successful creating opportunities for new entrepreneurs when it comes to bolstering a communitys economy however its not just a matter of helping existing businesses  its about encouraging new ones too in phoenix arizona some new entrepreneurs will soon find the support they need in of all places a former pickle factory the cdfi group prestamos  part of the nonprofit organization chicanos por la causa  has partnered with the national association for latino community asset builders nalcab to convert the square foot former home of a pickle manufacturing plant into an incubator space for businesses specializing in light manufacturing the collaboratives are using funds from pro neighborhoods as well as a grant from the us department of commerce economic development administration noel poyo nalcabs executive director said the incubator project is leveraging the pro neighborhoods funding in particular to attract additional investment he noted that relying on government funding which often requires a long approval period can slow a project down and discourage potential investors flexible capital in a deal is the glue that sticks everything together poyo said thats exactly what the jpmorgan chase money was used for the new entrepreneurs who join the space will also be provided loans access to manufacturing equipment and training on how to use that equipment up to  businesses may someday call the facility home potentially creating more than  local jobs jose martinez the president of prestamos said that one new business likely to join the incubator space is a manufacturer that makes soaps specially designed for nail salons what other businesses will take up residence in the old pickle factory will be determined later this year when the building  which is currently undergoing extensive renovations  reopens its doors martinez already envisions great things on the horizon theres a beauty to bringing a number of entrepreneurs with creative minds together to work with each other and

mothers to mentors pilot program paired new and experienced working moms it may take a village to raise a child but for some women at jpmorgan chase just one mentor was key to navigating new motherhood while going back to work  starting late in  the women on the move employee initiative partnered with win – our women’s interactive network business resource group – to pilot a maternity mentors program in new york developed to provide oneonone advice and an opportunity for candid dialogue on the challenges and questions tied to balancing motherhood with working  new moms were paired with more experienced working mothers from across the firm ”this program was born from feedback we received directly from employees we wanted to address some of the challenges of being a working mother particularly when it comes to preparing for and returning from maternity leave“ lake is cosponsor with asset management ceo mary erdoes of the women on the move employee initiative which was launched in recognition that women face unique barriers to professional success what began as a series of intimate town halls for the firm’s female employees in new york evolved into events all over the us since  the program has visited  cities and met with more than  women maternity mentors is just one project the initiative has launched the mentors and mentees covered a broad range of topics from balancing career and family to finding the best child care and talking to managers about career goals while each mentee had unique concerns and objectives the program also sought to highlight the tools and resources available within the firm it was also an opportunity to learn how the firm could better support women at this critical time in their personal and professional lives “not surprisingly new mothers have lots of questions” lake said “we wanted to help these women connect with someone in the firm who had been through it all before – someone they could feel comfortable approaching with the often personal questions they might avoid asking their manager” for jill otto a vice president with the private bank’s southeast team the program was just the career guidance she needed “the opportunity cost of coming to work was made higher by having a baby at home” otto said “i’m looking to be challenged at work and this program was so helpful in getting my career back on track” to accommodate the busy schedules of both mentors and mentees maternity mentors was a flexibly structured program giving participants the opportunity to work in different ways “as a mentor it was helpful to share experiences – good bad and sometimes ugly – discuss what i would have done differently and to reinforce that you can still have your work goals” said sarah white a mentor and managing director with the private bank for amy cargulia head of treasury services international and credit markets marketing in the commercial bank the program was an opportunity to “pay it forward” and share her experiences and insights as well as welcome her mentee to the “sorority of working mothers” cargulia isn’t alone in this sentiment many participants said they planned to extend their mentorship relationships beyond the formal program women on the move is now examining how the program can be implemented with a broader reach about women on the move recognizing that women face unique barriers to professional success jpmorgan chase launched women on the move in  the program began as a series of town halls for the firm’s female employees in new york and offered an opportunity to collectively explore the challenges they face in the workplace and share ideas on how to best support women in their career development led by asset management ceo mary erdoes and chief financial

a series of intimate town halls for the firm’s female employees in new york evolved into events all over the us since  the program has visited  cities and met with more than  women maternity mentors is just one project the initiative has launched the mentors and mentees covered a broad range of topics from balancing career and family to finding the best child care and talking to managers about career goals while each mentee had unique concerns and objectives the program also sought to highlight the tools and resources available within the firm it was also an opportunity to learn how the firm could better support women at this critical time in their personal and professional lives “not surprisingly new mothers have lots of questions” lake said “we wanted to help these women connect with someone in the firm who had been through it all before – someone they could feel comfortable approaching with the often personal questions they might avoid asking their manager” for jill otto a vice president with the private bank’s southeast team the program was just the career guidance she needed “the opportunity cost of coming to work was made higher by having a baby at home” otto said “i’m looking to be challenged at work and this program was so helpful in getting my career back on track” to accommodate the busy schedules of both mentors and mentees maternity mentors was a flexibly structured program giving participants the opportunity to work in different ways “as a mentor it was helpful to share experiences – good bad and sometimes ugly – discuss what i would have done differently and to reinforce that you can still have your work goals” said sarah white a mentor and managing director with the private bank for amy cargulia head of treasury services international and credit markets marketing in the commercial bank the program was an opportunity to “pay it forward” and share her experiences and insights as well as welcome her mentee to the “sorority of working mothers” cargulia isn’t alone in this sentiment many participants said they planned to extend their mentorship relationships beyond the formal program women on the move is now examining how the program can be implemented with a broader reach about women on the move recognizing that women face unique barriers to professional success jpmorgan chase launched women on the move in  the program began as a series of town halls for the firm’s female employees in new york and offered an opportunity to collectively explore the challenges they face in the workplace and share ideas on how to best support women in their career development led by asset management ceo mary erdoes and chief financial officer marianne lake senior women took the program on the road hosting events and empowering women in locations where the company employs hundreds and often thousands of women since it began the program has visited  cities and senior women from across the company have met with more than  employees women on the move has proven an invaluable channel to hear directly from and exchange ideas with women at all levels in the company as well as industry leaders and members of the communities in which we live and work as the women on the move program evolves we are proud to share the work of our employees and nonprofit partners in helping women succeed and transform their lives ﻿ related

where many could not in the south side chicago neighborhood of woodlawn she was happy to find a vacant twofamily brick home within walking distance of both her job and her sons high school tate recently purchased the property with the help of a local homebuyer assistance program and plans to live in the buildings firstfloor unit while renting out the other one she hopes to move in within a few months but for now shes looking forward to fixing up the place it just needs some tender love and care the yearold university of chicago police officer said the home buyer program benefiting tate is one of many community revitalization efforts funded by pro neighborhoods a  million fiveyear initiative by jpmorgan chase  co to help bring economic opportunity to distressed neighborhoods across the country one component of pro neighborhoods work entails commissioning research that identifies challenges facing various communities in an effort to arm local community development financial institutions cdfis as they form collaboratives to tackle those challenges in chicago that meant working to improve the crumbling housing stock in the citys less affluent neighborhoods the chicago collaborative a partnership consisting of three cdfis seeks to address the issue by providing capital to wouldbe homeowners and investors on the condition that they rehabilitate properties to meet the collaboratives high standards woodlawn with its convenient location near the university of chicago as well as the affluent neighborhood of hyde park was a perfect target for the program according to jack crane the director of lending at community investment corporation cic one of the chicago collaborative groups what youve had in woodlawn is either vacant or mismanaged apartment buildings and literally hundreds of vacant or buildings in poor condition but given its location it really doesnt make sense crane said theres a tremendous opportunity there to attract the people who work in hyde

qualify as food deserts  areas where grocery stores selling fresh healthy produce and other essential items are hard to come by in communities across the county the pro neighborhoodsbacked refresh is working to change that one of their first success stories bringing a rural colorado grocery store back to life fort market is the largest grocery store in costilla county one of colorados poorest areas for the countys residents the closest alternative to fort market is up to  miles awayand yet many have been making that drive because until recently fort market was on the ropes high energy bills caused by outdated equipment left the grocery store with little capital to adequately stock its shelves without outside intervention the store would have likely closed down this past summer fortunately for fort market and costilla county residents refresh partners the reinvestment fund and the colorado enterprise fund had identified the community as a prime candidate for help colorado enterprise fund stepped in with a loan that didnt just stop the store from closing  its clearing the way for major improvements fort market is now working to beef up its inventory to bring customers back into the fold theyll be able to come and get all their shopping needs done said anne misak colorado enterprise funds healthy food program manager just as important fort market is also upgrading its freezer and refrigeration equipment in order to cut down on energy usage and slash its electricity bills while pro neighborhoods’ funding helped cover the loans underwriting and closing costs its also funding staff positions  including misaks  that allow the cdfis to take a handson approach to guiding stores like fort market into a selfsustaining business model we can provide extra support to some of these stores and business owners who really need that extra help we have the time to do follow up calls and follow up visits misak said were really making sure theyre getting what they need to

organization chicanos por la causa  has partnered with the national association for latino community asset builders nalcab to convert the square foot former home of a pickle manufacturing plant into an incubator space for businesses specializing in light manufacturing the collaboratives are using funds from pro neighborhoods as well as a grant from the us department of commerce economic development administration noel poyo nalcabs executive director said the incubator project is leveraging the pro neighborhoods funding in particular to attract additional investment he noted that relying on government funding which often requires a long approval period can slow a project down and discourage potential investors flexible capital in a deal is the glue that sticks everything together poyo said thats exactly what the jpmorgan chase money was used for the new entrepreneurs who join the space will also be provided loans access to manufacturing equipment and training on how to use that equipment up to  businesses may someday call the facility home potentially creating more than  local jobs jose martinez the president of prestamos said that one new business likely to join the incubator space is a manufacturer that makes soaps specially designed for nail salons what other businesses will take up residence in the old pickle factory will be determined later this year when the building  which is currently undergoing extensive renovations  reopens its doors martinez already envisions great things on the horizon theres a beauty to bringing a number of entrepreneurs with

today would be called corruption but then was regarded as business as usual hamiltons political enemy—and eventual murderer—aaron burr was able to create a bank by sneaking a clause into a charter for a company called the manhattan company to provide clean water to new york city the innocuouslooking clause allowed the company to invest surplus capital in any lawful enterprise within six months of the companys creation and long before it had laid a single section of water pipe the company opened a bank the bank of the manhattan company still in existence it is today j p morgan chase the largest

invest surplus capital in any lawful enterprise within six months of the companys creation and long before it had laid a single section of water pipe the company opened a bank the bank of the

end video overlay how four bankers helped launch a chicago nonprofit how four bankers helped launch a chicago nonprofit jpmorgan chase service corps program uses employee expertise to support local efforts to create jobs and invest in the community when tony chopp landed in chicago for his jpmorgan chase  service corps experience what struck him most about the city was its rich history unlike his native and sprawling las vegas chicago is a city steeped in centuries of history a blanket of tightly connected neighborhoods that span  square miles the service corps program at jpmorgan chase sends top employees from around the world to work with nonprofits in various cities it is part of the company’s broader approach to corporate responsibility – which combines philanthropic investments with the skills and expertise of its employees they share otherwise costly expert advice on ways to increase the power of the nonprofits’ community impact together tony and his jpmorgan chase colleagues – the global service corps team lucy brash from the corporate investment bank cib equity and capital markets in new york city james tung from asset management in taipei and rajpal gahlaut from cib banking operations in mumbai  would be working to support an organization in one of chicago’s underserved communities dr bryon brazier a wellknown woodlawn community advocate speaks to tony and the service corps team about the history and vision of woodlawn their destination woodlawn a south side underserved neighborhood that borders the affluent hyde park home to the elite university of chicago there he and three service corps teammates would be partnered with bsd building self determination a social enterprise aiming to generate revenue for its parent nonprofit the arthur m brazier foundation ambf the starting point for their work would be creating an expansion strategy with accompanying financial forecasts through job training and certifications in robotics bsd’s goal is to provide valuable wellpaying hightech jobs for  of woodlawn’s residents each year they plan to train and hire employees from their neighborhood to work in their manufacturing facility that makes biodegradable plastic cutlery revenues from cutlery sales will pour back into their parent nonprofit ambf which then plans to inject these new funds back into the woodlawn community bsd industries resident engineer trista bonds is teaching tony how to move a axis industrial robot these machines will be used to train woodlawn community members to ready them with skills for highquality and indemand jobs however upon arrival at bsd the team quickly realized that there was a gap between initial project expectations and bsd’s current business position before they could help bsd expand and improve operations they needed to ready them to launch their yettobegin operations this would require pivoting their focus to critical sales goal setting financial planning and risk analysis to make that happen we quickly realized that we were essentially working with a nonprofit in startup mode shared chopp we underestimated what they needed from us most – financial modeling knowledge and plans for driving revenue this led tony and his team to regroup they had to assess how their skill sets could best help bsd achieve its launch goals and ultimately bring jobs and revenue to its local community it was humbling watching their scope of work shift dramatically during those first few days as they gained an understanding of bsd they dug in meeting with bsd’s two fulltime employees to get the information they needed to unearth where they could truly make an impact we weren’t going to walk away chopp declared this was an organization with two fulltime employees wearing  hats each there were four of us and we were going to figure this out tony center surrounded by his jpmorgan chase service corps team and client trista while brash went to work on developing bsd’s financial model tony and his other two teammates explored how they could lend value given the organization had already raised a significant portion of money through grants and local fundraising tony and his team wanted to make sure that money would last this led tony to explore the cost of materials they’d be using to create their cutlery the original price  per pound “that wasn’t going to give them the kind of margin they needed to be sustainable” said chopp the service corps analyzed many of the potential partners and price points associated with bsd industries production of plastic cutlery he made a few phone calls bringing his daytoday procurement skills from chase to the table chopp quickly identified a viable alternative primary material and negotiated the materials price down to  per pound – a staggering  savings while a small win for someone like chopp this was a huge win for bsd giving them even greater longevity for their hardearned grant funds over three weeks tony and his teammates worked to deliver a comprehensive set of recommendations that would empower bsd to raise awareness in the community maximize use of their grant money until they could produce revenue and professionally market their highimpact community initiatives rajpal tony james and lucy work on finalizing their deliverables to bsd industries getting ready to finish their three week assignment the entire experience brought chopp back to thinking about his problemsolving experiences in the marine corps and the different ways he’s been trained to work with people through his years with chase “in the marines i oversaw logistics you got an order you made it happen” said chopp “yet with community programs and volunteerism – much like business – it’s all about soft skills” chopp credits his year tenure with chase for developing those soft peoplecentric skills that made his time with bsd so rewarding “my evaluations with chase have forced me to look at how i work with people ask more questions figure out the ‘whys’” chopp shared “those questions and ‘whys’ really gave us an edge in helping get bsd on a path that would make them both profitable and sustainable” chicago service corps team members tony and lucy listen to dr byron brazier from the brazier foundations and project executive mentor commercial bank cfo marcus von kapff discuss the bsd industry project and brazier foundation’s work in chicago now this woodlawncentric program could move forward with confidence – financially and logistically – bringing both sustainable jobs and revenue to their local community and with a business model that wouldn’t burn through their grant money before they could begin generating revenue the chicago service corps team program representative and jpmorgan chase  co executive sponsors gather after the team’s kickoff event for a final picture before splitting off into project teams and beginning the work with local organizations as chopp looked back on his experience he said the impact of their work really hit home when he recently summed up his service corps mission and work with not only his project team of four but larger full cohort of sixteen to a group of fellow chase employees “i realized that i couldn’t do justice to what we’d accomplished for bsd in a fiveminute presentation” chopp confided “not only was i proud of the work we had done but i was inspired by how many fellow chase employees came up to me after my presentation and asked for more details i think that speaks to the impact we have as an organization not only do i have the camaraderie built with my  service corp colleagues but the work we did travels with us from community to community that’s exciting” read more on how skilled volunteering is helping nonprofits increase

at jpmorgan chase friday september   text size a a a the abilities of people with disabilities i was born in  to a big loving italian family in the finger lakes area of ny state  my brother joe was born in   joe was born with an extra chromosome  technically giving him a disability known as down syndrome  my grandparents immigrated to the us from italy and had no formal schooling my parents were not educated past high school  they had the wisdom though to view joes extra chromosome as a gift never once describing it to any of his five siblings as a disability  being only two years older than joe we grew up together and did everything together i simply looked at joe as my sibling my playmate my bunk bedsharing roommate  not as my sibling “with a disability” while he may not have been able to do all of the physical and mental things i could do i learned so much from joe about humility respect forgiveness resiliency being positive … i could go on and on  but let me share joes abilities some of which i attribute to his extra chromosomehis gift as my mom and dad described it ability to provide perspective joe has been my sounding board for as long as i can remember when i started to feel others had more than us when we were kids joe would remind me that no one had more love than the frappollis and what more could we want  when i thought calculus was going to ruin my life at cornell university a phone call to joe assured me my life would survive calculus  when i was stressed about leaving corporate life to go make baseball cards for a living joe said you love baseball why wouldn’t you do that joe is a calming voice of reason in this crazy world in which we live ability to connect  inspire everyone who meets joe feels better about themselves and leaves with a brighter outlook on their day  i cant explain it have pondered it for years and now just simply accept it  he draws people to him connects in a deep and personal way and somehow inspires them to see the best rather than focus on the struggles  we should all be so gifted ability to innovate joe works fulltime for gw lisk an engineering and manufacturing company that makes solenoids valves sensors for all different types of industries  joe has a quality assurance job  he checks components to ensure they are working properly prior to distribution  the machine he works on allows him to test two components at a time  he thought it was moving too slowly  he drew a picture of how the machine could be easily changed to test three components at a time  the supervisor was impressed brought joes picture to engineering and the machines have now been retrofitted per joes hand drawing abilities in the workplace when i entered the workforce in human resources i never considered a person with a disability to be any less qualified for employment my perspective has always been to figure out what job might fit that person best just as we would do for all employees or candidates joe was my lens into disabilities and taught me to look deeper and see the gift that each person has to offer i am especially proud to work at jpmorgan chase where we are committed to hiring and developing individuals with disabilities and provide an opportunity for all of us to be engaged in this space via the accessability business resource group i started the midwest chapter years ago and saw an immediate impact as managers became more aware and more engaged with our new office of disability inclusion the firm is putting even more resources behind this community i encourage everyone here to get involved—it will help make our great firm an even better place the lessons i’ve learned from my brother should serve as a lesson for us all — that people with disabilities can add as much value at work as anyone elseand sometimes even more about the author carlo frappolli is head of talent at jpmorgan chase in this capacity he is responsible for talent management leadership development
