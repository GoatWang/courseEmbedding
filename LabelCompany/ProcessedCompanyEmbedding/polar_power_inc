three months ended march   versus same yearago quarter net sales totaled  million in q  an increase of  as compared to  million in q  the increase in net sales was a result of an increase in the number of dc power systems sold within the us telecommunications market backlog totaled  million at march   as compared to  million at december   the decrease in backlog at the end of q  as compared to the end of q  was attributable to delays in renewing pricing terms for the companys dc power solutions with existing and new customers coupled with a lower than expected level of product sales to

report that during the first quarter we obtained approved vendor status with two additional us wireless carriers and now service  of the top  wireless carriers in the united states we anticipate these new carriers will commence ordering products in the upcoming quarters in preparation for these customers coming online we reduced our pricing structure and started training new employees to gear up production these strategic decisions resulted in a decline in our gross profit as a percentage of net sales to  from our normalized range of  we expect our gross profit as a percentage of sales to return to levels within the normalized range during the second half of  after we maximize labor efficiency and realize the positive changes with our new supply chain agreements during the first quarter of  we also developed a new kw horizontal diesel dc power system that comes at a lower cost and similar margin profile as our current product portfolio we believe that this new power system increases our competitiveness overseas meets new customer demands and will assist us in diversifying our current customer concentration profile amongst wireless carriers in the us we decided to implement more competitive pricing and develop new economy models in order to accelerate product acceptance with new customers on the rd front our engineers commenced new initiatives for our next generation dc power solution that will address the significant g market opportunity which we believe will be a much smaller footprint across many sites we expect g to be fully commercialized by  small cell sites are a key requirement for the mainstream rollout of g and we believe our competitive advantage in size and efficiency provides us with a unique opportunity to capitalize on this immense opportunity in the coming years we believe the outlook for the remainder of  is encouraging despite lower than expected sales and backlog for the first quarter of  we remain confident in our ability to continue to execute on our business plan for  and beyond our confidence is based in large part upon our new tier wireless carrier customers expected penetration in international markets deployment of new products and the commencement of our rental fleet with small to mediumsized telecoms we look forward to sharing more on our developing story at three investor conferences during the month of
