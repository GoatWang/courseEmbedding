officer time horizon longterm investment horizon emphasis on longterm earnings power rather than current earnings margin of safety and intrinsic value invest in a security after we have determined that the market price is lower than the intrinsic value the difference being our margin of safety margin of safety affords us a cushion to potentially avoid paying more for an asset than its intrinsic value seeking to manage risk through bottomup research in our opinion it is important to avoid highly leveraged businesses specifically because they are more exposed to an impairment of value during periods of industry or economic distress focus our efforts on understanding the likelihood of a change in the earnings power of a business due to changing competitive dynamics technological challenges and regulations among other factors in most cases we will avoid shareholderunfriendly businesses as it relates to management’s capital allocation decisions general market risk within a bottomup approach in environments with an insufficient margin of safety fully invested portfolio mandates can become too exposed to the risk of loss by owning potentially overvalued securities while a more flexible policy may help to reduce that risk by holding a reserve in cash and highquality debt instruments our focus is on analyzing balance sheet risk business model durability and managements
