financial highlights peter then will provide some additional financial commentary from there i’ll provide an operational highlights and comments of our market after that we will open the call up to questions in the first quarter strong execution and customer deployments and solid expense management enable us greatly to improve revenue and adjusted ebitda on a yearoveryear basis we generated quarterly revenues of  million an increase of  compared to first quarter  we continue to focus on strengthening our financial performance and growing the business with new and existing customers our  enterprise customers account for greater than  each in revenue these enterprise customers represented in multiple industries financial technology manufacturing and pharmaceutical we had two transactions greater than  million in revenue for the quarter geographically the americas and amea markets continue to show strong adoption for enterprise video our enterprise business performed well the america market represented  of our revenue and the amea market was  of our revenue for the quarter in apac we continue to make progress developing our pipeline through our partnership with fujitsu ctc and other unified communication partners apac represented  of our revenue for the quarter in the quarter we saw  larger enterprise implementations and upgrades to our latest release or expanded their video footprint additionally in q  our global renewal rates for maintenance and support term contracts and saas contracts were greater than  as i commented in the press release we saw timing of several deals with new and existing customers push into the second half of the year but we remain confident in our annual guidance as these deals remain in our future pipeline for additional financial commentary ill turn the call over to peter peter goepfrich thank you vern ill comment on a few items not already addressed by vern or included in our earnings release as discussed last quarter we changed what information is provided in our earnings release the changes were made to increase transparency and provide information that we use to plan monitor and evaluate our financial results in regards to revenues we continue to transition to more revenue thats recurring in nature weve provided supplemental information for subscription maintenance and support revenue from a nonoperating expense perspective weve separated sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses for reporting purposes as it relates to operating profitability weve provided supplemental information for adjusted ebitda a nongaap measure in addition to the new information were providing were no longer specifically calling out total bookings because total bookings includes a variety of longterm items in nature and it does not reflect the mix of the underlying bookings we believe the supplemental revenue information now provided as well as our quarterly and annual revenue guidance is more insightful and relevant to our performance as we continue to refine and enhance our reporting we may provide additional supplemental information in the future vern commented on revenue and ill provide more context to gross margins software license and appliance gross margin was  primarily driven by first quarter product mix which included a higher percentage of hardware revenue and software license revenue compared to prior quarters service gross margin was  primarily driven by improved economies of scale and increased service revenue as well as cost savings initiatives implemented in the second half of  total gross margins are expected to improve from the mid s early in the year to the mid to high s late in the year moving on to the balance sheet cash and investments were  million as of march   compared to  million as of december   well continue to manage cash closely and we expect that well be cash flow breakeven in the second half of  deferred revenue was  sorry  million as of march   compared to  million as of december   excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency deferred revenue decreased  primarily due to the timing of sales and the delivery of products and services we expect that deferred revenue will increase the balance of the year as noted in yesterdays press release while we expect second quarter revenue to be consistent with first quarter  revenue we expect adjusted ebitda to improve now back to vern with additional operating highlights and comments on our market vern hanzlik thank peter let me review some key operational highlights and market comments and then well open up the call for questions our software platforms ability to address the video market both at the departmental level and the enterprise level is unique in our defined markets well continue to focus on the global  industries verticals such as financial services pharmaceutical manufacturing and other business verticals at the enterprise level we continue to have success with new customers with proof of concept engagements we continue to win business because customers demand choice control and completeness of solution that we can offer qumu has the largest internal video deployments and the most demanding customers our customers needs for highly secured endtoend video platform plus an industrial grade broadcast network to deliver video and scale to audiences around the world both for live and ondemand video communications we continue to see used cases for video multiplying enhance our ability to enhance to expand horizontally in our customer base some of our top used cases for our customers are executive communications corporate training social video portals video blogging sales training customer service employee onboarding digital marketing unified communications mobile evidence capturing user generated content and iptv in q we began to implement and account based marketing strategy we expect to have a positive impact on out account acquisition and maximize our horizontal penetration to existing enterprise accounts in the future the opportunity for us with large accounts is courtesy in the number of qumu customers on the forbes global  list with the largest public companies qumus customers represent about  of the top  companies  of the top  companies  of the top  customers on the forbes list in the first quarter the majority of our contracts were on premise transactions both new and existing customers however we continue to see it trends towards our increasing percentage of cloud and hybrid deployments and our growing pipeline in january we conducted a twoday strategy meeting with  enterprise customers including several top  companies in multiple industries we received uniformly positive feedback on our product roadmap from these customers giving us additional confidence in our future technology plans in  we continue to advance our cloud and hybrid offering with the foundation of our next generation platform the new software platform will expand our current capabilities namely our customers to use video to enhance their work product even on a more broadly basis every day everywhere and any time and as weve mentioned before our hybrid deployments will continue to grow throughout  and in q well be deploying a new release combining pathfinder with qumu cloud for a more robust delivery service for all new and existing cloud customers unified communications is a key strategy for businesses to drive effective communication last quarter we announced a partnership with pexip that enhances pexip next generation fusion video conferencing platform with an integrated recording function powered by qumu this combination gives customers the ability to communicate as a virtual enterprise and manager of video assets with an enterprise grade backing we see a strong pipeline with new opportunities with this new partnership we see this type of video communication management as a huge disrupter in unified communications market and continue to be excited about the collective opportunity another strategic partner is citrix in our customer base and in the broader enterprise market there are hundreds of thousands of vdi desktops that are not optimized for viewing video partnering with citrix weve built a unique video player framework leveraging our pathfinder delivery network that delivers excellent video experience to vdi desktops expanding the reach of video in large corporations well be showcasing our qumu vdi player at a national show called citrix synergy  at the end of may our vdi solution gives a tremendous competitive advantage and addresses a key communication challenge for our customers as ive mentioned earlier we had continued growth in some of our largest enterprise customers for the first quarter in financial manufacturing and pharmaceutical verticals one customer in the americas is into financial services industry and continues to expand its footprint for delivery to all employees in the organization in the pharmaceutical market we had other customers in germany and in the uk expand the foundation of video investment for more reach for live ondemand and other video used cases in summary were in a strong position for growth in  which is why were maintaining our annual guidance we continue to invest in the future with a mindful discipline of our product direction a clear vision for our team and operational momentum to carry us into the second half of the year well positioned to reach our corporate milestones and revenue growth objectives now i would like to open up the call for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question or comment comes from the line of mark argento from lake street capital your line is open mark argento hey good morning guys vern hanzlik hey mark mark argento hey could you talk a little bit about your visibility into the second half from some of these larger transactions maybe talk about what is the  whats causing some of the shift the pushout of some of the larger deals is it featuresets is it budgets whats  maybe you can provide some visibility or some thoughts around that vern hanzlik the clarity i can provide mark is that some of them are proof of concepts and its just timing of the transactions the ones that we see in the pipeline right now as we look out through the year is not particularly feature sets its more timing for the customer and their budget cycles and proof of concept sometimes run  to  days and its just timing and negotiating with large organizations just it becomes a timing issue so were being a little bit more prudent on the timing of when we would close them mark argento sure and then you mentioned i think you said you signed two seven figure deals in the quarter were those hybrids onprem what type of deals were those vern hanzlik well it was revenue that they were  some of them were existing revenue that we took but one of them is hybrid and then other one is just an expansion of an existing customer the financial services industry continues to grow out their delivery network mark argento got you and then last for me the sales how big of a sales force are you running right now peter goepfrich quota carrying is about   mark argento is that where you see yourself got to running for the rest of the year peter goepfrich typically somewhere in that range vern hanzlik yes the only switch we would see is if we continue to see an inflection point of something with the unified communication partnership in that building out those partners but we want give more evidence to that mark argento one more and then ill hop back in but on the gross margin side you guys are still looking to see a nice pick up in gross margins in the second half and thats really a function of you seeing more that more software license bookings is that whats driving their margin improvement in the second half vern hanzlik yes for the most part yes software licenses will drive that margin up mark argento great thats it for me thanks guys vern hanzlik all right thanks mark operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of jeff vanrhee from craighallum your line is open jeff vanrhee got it hey there guys thanks for taking the call i guess vern as it relates to the pushouts referenced you saw few from q that you call out sounding more than that in q but notably it sounded like youre thinking those deals closed in the second half as opposed to q even with proof of concept  to  days it sounds like there is maybe a little more in there can you just expand on why the not necessarily a one quarter but it sounds like youre thinking rather than q close as their second half closes just whats changed with the customer to drive that behavior vern hanzlik yes the ones that flowed out of q into q jeff and then there is ones that we identified that were in q that potentially push into q so i think some of its market related some of it was just timing for these big customers that when we were able to get the deals done our sense of urgency versus theirs when were dealing with these larger enterprises just even if theyre exiting customers its a cycle so i think that we have a clear visibility of what the pipeline is through the end of the year and we have deals identified that were looking at thats kind of why were sticking with the guidance that we have and then kind of pushing these things as quickly as we can i think that thats the one that we usually see in this enterprise sales cycle jeff vanrhee the accountbased marketing strategy maybe you can expand on what that means vern hanzlik yes so what weve done jeff is weve looked at what  so i was stating those facts because of the amount of customers that we have in the forbes  but what were doing as we get more horizontal in our bigger account base were getting more revenue as people understand the used cases that are broader perspective which drives more revenue for us whether were building out the network or were going into different departments that they havent even talked to us so its an awareness of a focus list within that global  and continuing to expand the video platform story and then how people should be using it because one department doesn’t know what the other department is using and i think thats really education around unified communications all the used cases that are laid out and how they can take advantage of the platform whether thats departmental or enterprise jeff vanrhee could you quantify or give us a sense of pipeline build maybe thinking back six months ago and comparing what you see now both in overall value as well as construction early stage late stage deals or any other meaningful observations there vern hanzlik i think the one thing were doing on pipeline as we bring new opportunities in so weve got as i had mentioned on the unified communications we have a list of somewhere in the neighborhood of  to  different types of opportunities within that relationship that we have with the pexip group but thats one platform that weve done a really good job of integrating with and then the account piece is just deals that come in rfps that were responding to proof of concept so i think that were scrubbing the opportunities more diligently so that we can see what the conversion is and then the enterprise ones versus the departmental ones and whether theyre on premise or cloud or hybrid doesn’t really matter but it does dictate where were selling to whether its it or departmental form the size perspective but i would say that the volume of the pipeline is where weve been i would say that were not at the three times coverage were more at a two times coverage and i think thats where we continue to think we can get more opportunities out of the base as we see in our revenue right now jeff vanrhee i guess just lastly then along those lines the account based marketing strategy it sounds like youre trying to think about how to have drive better volume in the front end of that  in the front end of that pipe in terms of just lead identification can you just talk about where the leads are coming from now how youre sourcing them and maybe any incremental color on some of the steps youre changing or taking to meaningfully grow the quantity and scope whats coming in the front end vern hanzlik yes i think that well were using all of the latest techniques with digital marketing where we use marketo internally we drive campaigns based on these used cases we are kind of scrubbing the list with inside of the accounts that are in this global  we target all the used cases and the people that would be around that and then the leads flow into there and then we quality them they come into the pipeline they get lead we put them on to the reps if there is an existing customer or its a new like weve got a proof of concept going on a very large opportunity that its been going on beginning of q and it flows into q because of the poc started and it cuts of the cycle there but i think for us right now its just seeing how that account based marketing because weve had more of a broader brush with the lead jeff and then weve come back to this as where our revenues coming out of our base and then also the types of accounts that are acquiring are broadcast quality network that they need to put in people are starting to see that they need to have that which is really where were focusing on that and thats where we see the biggest opportunity for where were at as a company jeff vanrhee okay and i guess just one last quick one the cash certainly ebitda youve made great strides on the cost controls and ebitda in the past cash generation in the near term how do you think about over the next two three quarters where we see cash bottomed as for cash balances vern hanzlik well we dont give a explicit cash number because of the timing of working capital but if you use our ebitda guidance gives you a reasonable proxy give or take to cash use so for seeing at a number and looking at  million to  million because were not extending out beyond that for second quarter guidance other than to say second half were going to be cash flow positive so you can take it from there give or take that number so somewhere south of  million but not much jeff vanrhee yes got it okay great thank you guys vern hanzlik all right thanks jeff operator thank you our next question or comment comes from the line of glenn mattson from ladenburg thalmann your line is open glenn mattson yes hi good morning i jumped in a little late so i might have missed if youve covered this already please excuse me but the competitive landscape can you talk about who youre seeing when you go into accounts and is it usually multiple players and who is there and why youre winning or not winning in various circumstances vern hanzlik yes we didnt touch on it glenn but ill give you the color we see the normal competitors on the enterprise side which would be call or a vbrick but where were winning are very high percentages when were building a large delivery network thats end to end and highly secure and also redundant those types of things thats what were winning our business and those are usually at the proof of concept that i had mentioned before so on the departmental side its a different level with our cloud products so we see some of the boutique players and those transactions seem to be those are smaller but i think were seeing we  see a little bit of call on the cloud side because theyre pushing a lot of that and we dont see vbrick there very much and then you see some of the other players that have kind of drifted off into the online video portals and really were just trying to expand that from a perspective of what were doing with unified communications because we see that as a way to get a foundation of recording and then expand from there from a cost perspective glenn mattson and then how about pricing vern hanzlik at the enterprise level our pricing is holding right now and on the cloud side were competitive there were starting to see more traction as we get more features into our cloud and are sort of where were going with that platform glenn mattson okay and then i realized its very early and were not talking about  yet but the sales force that as it exists now down in the mid teens is that enough to build continued momentum into  plus the channel partners or we need to start adding people again at some point vern hanzlik were going to be prudent about how were adding them we want to see how the channel takes off and where you allocate resources in order to build the alternative channel thats one of the things were keeping a close eye on and weve a lot of activity around that area so we want to create more draft that way and keep our enterprise team focused on the larger transaction and more solution selling around video solutions as we get broader into this global  glenn mattson okay what do you guys think and not to hold you to anything but what would you say is the natural growth rate for this business right now maybe what the market is doing and what youre doing if you should be growing better that that or at the same rate or any color there on a long term vern hanzlik on a long term basis i think that were  this market is somewhere between  and  i think the wildcard glenn as far as growth is where the unified communications and some of the things were doing combine and does that create a different inflection point in different growth rate were seeing a lot of activity around that but i want to have more evidence of where the changes on the growth rates are because there is market shifting and video is going to be growing dramatically inside of businesses and the management piece will start to see more of that so i think that its a wise scale in any of the analysts that we talk to about the market give it that range its somewhere between  to  so i think that we  thats where we see our growth rate based on what weve laid out to date and i think that were looking for inflection point both from a global perspective because were still  our partnerships are just starting to produce some revenue out of the apac and also in emea and youve got some economical things going on right now but i think in general thats where we see the growth rate right now which is until we see more evidence on these other sides with the unified communications being a wild card that creates wild accounts for us but also then we can expand in those because our strategy with the uc guys is just an entry point and then we sell our enterprise platform beyond that glenn mattson okay great thanks for the color operator thank you operator instructions our next question or comment comes from the line of jason revland from blueprint capital your line is open go ahead sir jason revland yes good morning everyone thanks for taking my question my question is off the topic if you will relating to the minority holding you have in briefcam in monitoring this company it really appears to be quite a bit of momentum there and interest in the technology particularly in the contest of global terrorism they also seem to be in a pretty good expansion mode just based on the job openings you can see on their website so the two part question i have is can you remind us of your involvement your ownership position there and two maybe comment on whether this can be potentially monetized for cash at some point and then short and medium term thanks vern hanzlik thanks jason i think the original investment i think that the organization put in was about  million in capital i think that were  i sit on the board at briefcam and we definitely are having some of those conversations there is some interest of that business and their ip in the surveillance area which is not a core focus for us so that would be something that we would be looking to monetize at the right level so were definitely reviewing all those options in order to were trying to build the business from around the video and then use that stuff inside of our products so we would probably divest that if it made sense at the right time jason revland and just as a potential followup do you have any sense of whether the valuation of that business has been expanding or contracting in the last year peter goepfrich we cant comment on it because its private side company that we dont have the ability to do comment on publicly but other than to say our asset on our books is covered by value so weve got a  million asset on our books related to our investment and were comfortable with that valuation jason revland okay i appreciate the detail thank you vern hanzlik okay operator thank you operator instructions i am showing no additional audio questions at this time i would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks vern hanzlik okay well i want to thank everybody for joining us today and if you have any

the call over to vern vern hanzlik thank you peter good morning i’d like to make a few comments before peter reviews the numbers qumu’s first quarter  was a solid start to the year and we continue to take a longterm view of our dynamic industry we are successfully transitioning qumu to a higher margin more predictable software as a service model and we are doing so while serving large organizations globally with both onprem and cloud solutions at the same time we’re investing in our future with an exciting new development about our suite of solutions that we’re announcing later this month and we have validated our strategy is in step with the market direction towards highly collaborative video environments the digital workforce thrives on video and enterprise level clients need solutions both encourage and manage that demand at enterprise scale let me touch on a few financial highlights during the quarter we lost  million of adjusted ebitda was within the guidance revenue fell short of guidance by  due to late closing two large deals representing nearly  million in bookings both of those deals closed in the first week of the second quarter one of those was a mid six figure onpremise deal which we have taken in the first quarter and the other was a subscription deal worth approximately  million gross margins for the first quarter improved yearoveryear up from  to  and last we ended the quarter with a cash position of  million with our sights set on large enterprises qumu added nine new customers during the quarter including a significant six figure deal with british telecom this puts us on place with our objective of  new enterprise customers during  given that the second half of the year is typically strong order and new customer acquisition as for our existing customers we continue to see high renewal rates greater than  for the quarter and our customer satisfaction scores remain in the high s due to our continued focus on quality product and service in the americas and emea markets of the nine new customers i mentioned three were onpremise sales and six were cloud deals of the new customers they were also predominantly blue chip companies meaning our landandexpand strategy is taking hold one company plans to implement a hybrid cloud and an onprem solution this is as much an endorsement of our enterprise expertise as it is our technology platform serving the customers well pays dividends in the long run in the form of true partnership and sustained loyalty in asiapac we are seeing a momentum build with our japanesebased partner vcube asiapac represented  of our revenue for the quarter compared to  for the fourth quarter in  i’m excited that vcube is further  furthering our commitment to qumu by expanding our own product offering with the qumu cloud our sales pipeline remains strong approximately  times during the quarter we closed  of the  opportunities that we were tracking for the quarter larger transactions continue to be our sweet spot however the timing of closure on these deals can be challenging to predict and the combination mix of saas revenue perpetual license revenue adds complexity to our projections for financial commentary over to peter and then i’ll come back and review some strategies and market comments before we open up for questions peter peter goepfrich thank you vern i’ll comment on a few additional items total revenue was  million for the first quarter compared to  million last quarter software license and appliance revenue was  million for the first quarter compared to  million last quarter the decrease in software license and appliance revenue was primarily due to the seasonality of software license sales in which the fourth quarter is typically the strongest quarter subscription maintenance and support revenue was  million for the first quarter compared to  million last quarter professional services and other revenue was  for the first quarter compared to  million last quarter as noted in to  fourth quarter  earnings release fourth quarter revenue included subscription maintenance and support revenue of  million and professional services revenue of  million a previously deferred revenue contingent on a customer’s acceptance which was received in the fourth quarter going forward subscription maintenance and support revenue related to this customer is expected to be  annually in  we expect that software license and appliance revenue will continue to be dependent on large onpremise sales which are difficult to forecast and that subscription maintenance and support revenue will grow steadily from a quarterly base approximately  million gross margin was  for the first quarter compared to  last quarter the benefit to the gross margin relating to the previously noted customer acceptance was  and  for the fourth quarter and full year  respectively the total gross margin percentage is expected to improve from the low s early in the year to the high s late in the year total gross margin will continue to be impacted by the timing and mix of large onpremise sales moving on to operating expenses and adjusted ebitda a nongaap measure we continue to diligently manage our expense structure significantly improving adjusted ebitda compared to the corresponding periods last year total operating expenses decreased  for the three months ended december   and adjusted ebitda improved  million to a loss of  million for the three months ended march   now for the balance sheet cash cash equivalents were  million as of march   and december   which is approximately  million more than expected due to better cash collections than forecasted and the deferral of the  annual bonus payment from march to april cash at the end of the second quarter is expected to be approximately  million as it relates to full year  guidance we are maintaining our revenue guidance of  million to  million and improving our net loss and our adjusted ebitda guidance by approximately  million reflecting our continued focus on expense management during these dynamic times we continue to expect that we’ll be cash flow breakeven for the second half of  now back to vern vern hanzlik thanks peter let me review a few key operating highlights and that are related to our market and product direction qumu is focused on a twopronged strategy first capitalize on our core strength and serve large enterprise with complex global video needs and second build new partnerships in the video ecosystem during q i validated our strategy by meeting with  large enterprise customers and prospects in europe and in the us it was a great opportunity to listen to their challenges as they undertake massive transformation in digital communication they know the digital workforce inside and outside the firewall is going to create and consume a minimum of an estimate of  times more video over the next three years and they understand this will place huge demands on their network on security and management qumu gives them the ability to manage the explosion of video content during these customer meetings we shared our upcoming new platform architecture that i alluded to earlier we received positive feedback and validation that our strategy is directly in line with both the market and their needs towards that end i’m very happy to tell you that we’ll be launching our new product architecture and solution later this month at our customer summit in new york and london so please be on the lookout for announcements we are currently briefing analysts and preparing a new website among other launch activities this announcement is both a vision and a set of solutions that give customers the most complete and extensible platform in the industry and will help grow our ecosystem of potential white label for our oem partners speaking of partners another takeaway from those customer meetings was their considerable interest in qumu’s integration with microsoft office   of customers that i talked to in the process were rolling out skype for business deployments skype for business facilitates collaboration and knowledge transfer now they want to turn those conversations into video assets they expressed their excitement about qumu’s seamless integration with skype for business that lets them record skype for business calls store search and manage in their qumu video library plus they can broadcast a live meeting or as a recording in the entire enterprise on the qumu pathfinder network this fundamentally extends the value of skype for business from a collaboration tool to a streaming platform with pathfinder’s intelligent network with a strong customer interest in mind we conducted a campaign last month showcasing our seamless integration with the entire microsoft collaboration suite which includes yammer sharepoint and skype for business in summary we are managing the business with an eye to the future we have the support of large loyal customers as we transition to a more predictable higher margin saas model versus perpetual license accounts as i have mentioned many times our landandexpand strategy is working with our saas product providing entry into new enterprise customers and finally we’re evolving our enterprise video platform which will open up powerful potential of growing our ecosystem of partners and other market opportunities when i meet with customers i always take the opportunity to ask them why they choose qumu they consistently respond that they count on qumu because of our deep expertise in complex enterprise deployments that we can deliver both inside and outside the firewall the evolution of the market is changing unified communications is merging with enterprise video content management plus intelligent delivery customers are looking for a true platform that provides an endtoend solution we’re the only solution that provides software with all core functions in one platform as the new digital enterprise opens up the floodgates for video qumu is positioned with the right product right architecture and plus enterprise expertise to help customers achieve their digital vision i’ll now open up the call for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you ladies and gentlemen operator instructions and our first question comes from mark argento from lake street capital your line is open mark argento hey good morning guys just wanted to get a better idea cost structure it sounds like obviously your guidance for this  for the full year you’re planning a  million or  million in expenses you’re able to take on new model where should we see those coming out of and how does that impact the longer term kind of opportunity vern hanzlik it come  it generally across all areas from  slightly from every area so cogs to rd to sales and marketing to ga and we don’t anticipate it impacting our ability to reflex and grow proactively in the future we’re just being prudent at this point with managing the cost structure peter goepfrich yeah and i think just to add to that mark i think that and i’ve had conversation with multiple people i mean we’re seeing some of these partnerships that are going to start to take hold which helps us as i mentioned with some of the things we’re doing with integration with the microsoft suite but also just in the unified comms and then those partnerships are starting to take hold in different vertical markets like healthcare and then also our partnerships that are with larger integrators just taking our platforms and running them and creating practices around them so that will help our ability to continue to create growth with less expense mark argento got it and then i think you had mentioned bonuses have those been accrued for or how does that kind of impact the next quarter… vern hanzlik yes mark argento … in terms of the numbers vern hanzlik it was all timing it was accrued for at the end of  and normally we pay it out in march but didn’t get paid out until april mark argento perfect and then more of a strategic question so it seems to me the way this market’s evolving that the model  your model almost become more of a middleware type model where you are kind of providing that connectivity between the various bigger the skype for business and other kind of input devices or consumption devices do you guys think about the business maybe indifferently than you did six months or a year ago and any kind of major strategic changes you could see on the horizon in terms of how you go to market vern hanzlik yeah well i did comment little bit on that mark but i think the net of it is we’re becoming more of this video hub where the inputs are come they are endless on the inside and then the core focus for us is to make sure we’re managing these video assets at scale and then also providing this intelligent which we branded around our pathfinder and more of an intelligent delivery network that we can expose from an enterprise cdn perspective inside the firewall so there will be opportunities for us to people leveraging up our core technologies more of a platform and as you said a middleware piece where they’re talking to our services i mean we’ll have  we have a lot of different partnerships that we’ll announce here later this month and we’re calling our extensions which are extensions to our core platform for what we provide and then we’ll continue to build that out and then those will also bring us into different vertical markets also mark argento okay great and then just one more housekeeping peter did you say you expect to be cash flow breakeven or positive in the second half i hear you right peter goepfrich yes mark argento you guys are comfortable peter goepfrich cash flow breakeven second half of the year mark argento so you’re comfortable with the cash levels with the balance sheet where it sits right now to kind of get you to where you need to be peter goepfrich correct mark argento great thanks guys vern hanzlik thanks mark operator and our next question comes from jeff vanrhee with craighallum your line is open jeff vanrhee yeah thank you just a couple first i guess peter i wanted to clarify on the deals you talked about the two pushes  million in value and that they both closed in the first week of the second quarter but i missed something about you said taken in q i want to be sure that the revenue for those all fall in q correct vern hanzlik that’s correct jeff yeah i would add probably i  that was me so it’s… jeff vanrhee okay vern hanzlik yeah that revenue for the onpremise field would be in q and the  that the subscription one would be a ratable deal anyway jeff vanrhee got it yeah okay just wanted to be sure vern hanzlik yeah jeff vanrhee and then i guess last quarter you were talking about expectations of  to  bookings growth for ‘ if i recall still a valid number is that guidance are you reiterating or just expressing comfort with that here vern hanzlik yeah jeff vanrhee okay and then so the q essentially looking for ballpark flattish sequentially with such a strong start to the quarter right you’ve got a couple of big ones in i’m surprised it’s probably  it’s not a little bit better is there anything else  are you seeing other deals like all cycles essentially pushing so these pushed into the quarter but you had to push a few out that were in the quarter how should i think of that vern hanzlik i think that’s the best way to think about it jeff i think some of them that’s why we got a range on it the way we do some of them can drop end of the quarter we’re continuing to negotiate and so they will so that’s the variability of  when i  as i’ve continued to talk about we’re trying to be as prudent as possible how we’re articulating this to everybody because we’ve got our baseline of our subscription stuff which we’ve got base as peter mentioned around that  million range and then our variables per quarter are the onprem stuff and then stuff that falls in from a subscription perspective we get it earlier in the quarter so i think that there are ones that we’re negotiating that kind on the bubble and we just wanted to have that flexibility but there are  as we see significant type things that we’re in proofofconcepts where the budget’s going to land and are we going to be able to get it done so we just wanted to be conservative but with also there’s the pipeline as i mentioned is robust and we’re seeing it more in our second half of the year than we are in the first two quarters jeff vanrhee how much of the sort of the delayed cycles do you sense is due to architecture sort of feature issues things that are going to be addressed to this new launch versus potentially otherssales execution vern hanzlik some of them are to that i think that when people want to have a validation like we’re validating something right now in a hybrid deployment for a particular client it’s a larger hybrid where it’s cloud and some of the things we’re doing featurewise and we’re testing that with them validation is a larger organization so those things do come into play for sure also just as we’re rolling this out we had some opportunities to show this to folks and they got excited about it we are on the unified communications piece we want to validate it internally to make sure it’s all working and these are even existing customers because it’s a big  it’s a bigger play we’re enabling  end points in a big bank they want to make sure that you’re going to be able to handle the scale so there are just things like that that happened in the fabric in these larger enterprise that they want to validate and as we’re  we’ve got other ones where we’re rolling out larger delivery networks and they want to test and validate so that is a valid point jeff vanrhee how would you describe the sales execution progression over the last  months i think in the early ‘ you moved to this i think it was  if i recall a named account strategy it’s been a little while but i think you kind of went through a few iterations where do you feel you are now in that evolution are we still sort of searching for the right structure do you feel like they’ve got it and they’re executing to the fullest with what they have right now in product and they just need this new architecture obviously i’m just trying to get a sense of do you think you’re essentially holding share losing share gaining share just those kind of dynamics however you can frame that for me vern hanzlik yeah well let me answer it twofold jeff because i think what i alluded to in my  our twopronged strategy is one we’re holding share in our base of our customers and we’re expanding in those base and we continue to show that with our existing revenue out of our base and transactions and i also look at our account base marketing strategy the focus of our  accounts that we’ve been focusing on as we sit for  and as we look to  we would expand out of that with more selfservice and things like that in our cloud so that will continue like so we set this objective of  new customers this year on the enterprise in that  so that’s  we’re continuing to track on that the second piece of that is where we’re changing and i think the question earlier from mark was that we’re changing the strategy a little bit in our partnerships where people are taking our product into markets that we’re not into and so that will help us from execution perspective beyond and creates more draft and those are the things that we would message to the market more effectively because as we look at our pipelines right now the things that we’re doing so the partnerships are starting to evolve and the bt stuff is kicking off and we’re starting to see traction there so i think that the strategy is going to help us because we’ve created a whole service based architecture with all our major points in the product so that people can take it and run with it in addition to that our customers are resonating so our account base are getting more horizontal so we can sell more to our existing base and as we lay this out competitively to compete with the players that are competing in our defined market in this global  which are the largest businesses in the world we think that we can stack up against anybody with an endtoend solution a lot of the competitive landscape is trying to put on intelligent delivery onto their solutions inside the firewall we know that that is paramount you have to have a delivery network for video as it expands so we feel really bullish on where our strategy is the validation of where our customers are and just the natural excitement based on what we’re doing that we can solve problems both inside the firewall and externally jeff vanrhee got it and i guess last then the  where are you  what is the sales org now in terms of size and structure vern hanzlik we’ve got seven what we call enterprise people jeff that are selling to the largest businesses and we got six sort of account managers which are doing sort of the midlevel size deals and then we have two bt people so the total is about  right now that are  that have a quota on their head jeff vanrhee got it okay great thank you operator and our next question comes from glenn mattson with ladenburg thalman your line is open glenn mattson hi good morning i guess interesting to hear about i mean pipeline  times coverage sounds like that improved during the quarter and closing a large number of your deals as  i think you said  of the opportunities you’re tracking you closed vern hanzlik yeah glenn mattson so it seems like the sales effort is resulting in better performance but we are curious about the base of what we have now and just kind of protecting that flank of subscription revenue you’re talking about  renewal rates but do you have any very large renewals coming up this year vern hanzlik yeah we’ve got large renewals every quarter glenn and so i think we’re  that’s what we focus on the most is that customer sat piece and the renewal rates on a quarterly basis to show up that base glenn mattson okay but any like top five customers or i mean i know top  is a big percent of the revenue but those flow through pretty regularly i guess vern hanzlik they do i mean we  they’re always the bigger ones are always a little bit at risk but i think that we  that depends on whether they’re going to change out a big infrastructure or not and our bet is sometimes that they’re not going to change that out so but we do  we have over  renewals on a quarterly basis for our client base and we continue to track those we see them out through the whole year so we’re very focused on them glenn mattson okay and then peter just on the receivables the collections what was going on there a significant drop sequentially peter goepfrich yeah the significant improvement we didn’t have the reflective glenn mattson no i mean for drop in the  on the balance sheet you guys  significant improvement yeah peter goepfrich the significant improvement on collections side probably about  million better than we would have anticipated on the actual collection side that said we were light on our sale based on our guidance and that was the primary results why it went down a little bit more than we would have anticipated on a balance sheet approach glenn mattson okay great that’s it for me thanks guys vern hanzlik thanks glenn operator operator instructions our next question comes from neil cataldi from blueprint capital your line is open neil cataldi hi guys ibm who bought ustream last year put out some interesting data last month high level they talked about the increasing use of video within the enterprise managers relying more on streaming video in the enterprise and they noted that mobile viewership of cloud video has increased fivefold just in  versus  my question to you is this your customer list is great i think i speak for most investors who are sort of waiting for this inflection point with growth and you’ve referenced this landandexpand strategy in the past what’s holding up the customer base today what are you seeing from them or hearing from them and does this recent ibm data maybe suggest the change in sentiment where they’re going to start moving a little bit faster vern hanzlik i can’t  the activity that we’re seeing neil the internal networks where the people are becoming more aware that they need to have a enterprise cdn inside the firewall and i referenced  times growth over the next three years just on these corporate networks and it is becoming we’ve got proofofconcepts that we’re running right now in larger organizations that are over  employees that they’re trying to figure out and this is mostly for live and vod so the pace that this market is going to pick up i think is over the next two year to three years where people are going to see the pain on their inside the firewall needs and they’re going to have to build on a network why we’re starting to message more and more our enterprise cdn which are pathfinder intelligent network which gives them the capability to do that in a diversified fashion and alleviate that pain that they’re going to have on their network as they start to produce more and more video on their backbones so i don’t know that we’re tracking the timing of that perceived inflection point it is real it is going to happen and we’re seeing it more and more as people we’re talking to more to the we’re getting more on the business side on our external communication stuff with cloud and smaller deals but when we’re doing hybrid deals if they’re using cloud with our pathfinder stuff onprem or it’s a large onpremise deal it depends like large onpremise deals are mostly dealing with ip with the it organization they’re validating how it fits into their fabric it’s going to run in their data center and we continue to see opportunities in that even as we transition to this more saas model over the next couple of years so the  ibm is right that they’re going to do that they’ve made some big investments there but i think their challenge with this inside the firewall need and they’re going to have  they need to be able to approach that you have to create a solution inside the firewall in order to do it because it’s delivered on a secure network neil cataldi okay thanks and one more sort of high level too i think we’ve started to see more ma activity in the unified communications space you guys have referenced working with some companies there are you seeing any change in how you see companies are looking at video and whether there’s a little bit more of an interest level there to expand their product suite vern hanzlik yeah well i mean as i talked about our i kind of focused on the microsoft stuff that we’re doing with social business with yammer and sharepoint but it was apparent to me in talking to a lot of customers and the majority of them were in europe that were rolling out skype for business and these were very large organizations all north of  employees where they’re starting to look at how much of these video assets because the phone calls are changing to video calls and the video calls need to be are they compliance based and do you have to have a management backend to do that we demonstrated some of our skype for business interface to those folks so there’s definitely an appetite for how much do they need the management so the video content management component of those assets are going to become more prevalent and there’s definitely a need for that at scale so the convergence as i just closed on is the unified communications market whether it’s skype for business whether it’s inaudible  whether it’s an acano whether it’s a video starleaf zoom they’re all  we’re seeing a lot of activity around the telemedicine environment and they’re going to have to manage those assets so there is lots of convergence between that on the management side of those where those vendors are providing great video small meeting collaboration but they’re not providing management in large streaming and so we’re focusing on the management piece and building out the network so they can use those interfaces as broadcast interfaces if they so desire and that is resonating with our customers neil cataldi okay great thanks guys vern hanzlik all right thanks neil peter goepfrich thanks neil neil cataldi yeah operator and i’m showing no further questions i would now like to turn the call over to vern hanzlik president and ceo for closing remarks vern hanzlik thank you i want to thank everybody for joining us today and let us know if
