ensure that the clients’ objective of gaining broadbased index exposure in a cost effective way are met at the initiation of the portfolio and throughout the investment process   portfolio profile portfolios are used to replicate selected indices and achieve benchmark returns with minimal dispersion the tradeoffs between tracking error and transaction costs are carefully monitored to achieve the goal of minimum performance variance from the selected benchmark portfolio construction we use a variety of indexing methodologies for portfolio construction these include full index replication and optimization the selection of the methodology is based on an analysis of account size index names and liquidity considerations of the benchmark portfolio monitoring the focus of portfolio monitoring throughout the investment process is minimizing cash exposure managing accrued dividends and corporate actions and ensuring compliance with client guidelines and restrictions these result in the minimum variance possible from the selected benchmark  performance russell top  performance – gips presentation       fixed income piedmont’s yield advantage strategies are grounded in the belief that yield is the most reliable tool for generating alpha and optimizing return per unit of risk the goal of  our philosophy is to deliver longterm results that maximize the contribution of yield to total return while preserving capital typically this yield advantage is derived through credit optionality and other spread products but can be attained through duration based on the stage of the business cycle we also believe that the best way to maximize yield’s return contribution is with an investment process that has multiple levers for success consistent with this view the yield advantage process works to extract alpha contributions from three areas quantitative idea generation fundamental credit research and macro insights the use of multiple alpha sources diversifies our performance and increases its reliability macro positioning portfolio managers leverage firmwide macro insights to position portfolio’s duration opportunistically based on yield curve shiftsflattening rate forecasts nontraditional market inputs quantitative idea generation quantitative modeling generates insights on issuer and sector pricing anomalies including credit quality valuation spreads

make when choosing a financial advisor your details done by eric rosenberg january   choosing a financial advisor is a big decision unlike hiring a mechanic or hairstylist financial advisors are usually long term relationships they are also taking responsibility for your money with your entire livelihood on the line choosing the wrong advisor would be a big mistake avoid these  common blunders when choosing an advisor to ensure you are on track to meet your financial goals hiring the first advisor you meetdepending on where you live you could have dozens of options for advisors it is tempting to hire the closest advisor to home some people might just pick the first advisor in the yellow pages this decision requires more time take the time to interview at least a few advisors before picking the best match for you choosing an advisor with the wrong specialtyadvisors can have different focus area some specialize on retirement planning some are best for business owners or those with a high net worth others are best for young professionals starting a family this type of focus does not make an advisor better or worse it makes them better for certain people than others be sure to understand an advisor’s strengths and weaknesses do that before signing on the dotted line  picking an advisor with an incompatible strategyeach advisor has a unique strategy some advisors may suggest aggressive investments others are more conservative again there is no right or wrong however there is a right and wrong for you if you don’t feel comfortable with risk don’t choose an advisor that prefers aggressive investments if you prefer to go all in on stocks an advisor that prefers bonds and index funds is not a great match for your style skipping checking referencesmost advisors are happy to offer references to prospective clients if you ask about references and they act nervous thats a red flag quality advisors are happy to discuss past missteps and what they learned this helps them keep from repeating the same mistake in the future calling references only takes a couple of minutes it can help put you at ease when handing over the keys to your bank account not asking about credentialsto give investment advice financial advisors are required to pass a test ask your advisor about their licenses tests and credentials this ensures they are qualified to meet your needs financial advisors tests include the series  and series  or series  some advisors go a step further and become a certified financial planner or cfp also ask where they went to school and what degree they earned some advisors have a finance degree from a top school others could have an english degree from a community college making assumptions when they are affiliated with a reputable brandan advisor might appear qualified and professional due to an association with a major firm like jp morgan or morgan stanley however that doesn’t make them a great advisor working with an advisor from a reputable firm is not a bad idea it often leads to stability and better tools and information however they still have quite a bit of autonomy choose an advisor because they are the best fit not because of their branding not understanding how they are paidthere are different payment models for financial advisors some are “fee only” in this case they charge a flat rate no matter what others charge a percentage of assets under management some advisors are paid by mutual funds this is the worst situation for you this is a serious conflict of interest if the advisor earns more by ignoring your best interests do not hire themdo your research to find the perfect advisorchoosing a financial advisor is an important decision it requires the best information available gathering information about financial advisors can be tough that is why smartasset created a financial advisor match tool answering basic questions results in a list of local advisors to choose from it doesnt matter if you
