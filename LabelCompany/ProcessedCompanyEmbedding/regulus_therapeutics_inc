therapeutics to treat inflammatory diseases companies announce significant microrna therapeutics collaboration london  philadelphia  carlsbad calif apr   business wire  glaxosmithkline gsk and regulus therapeutics llc regulus today announced a worldwide strategic alliance to discover develop and market novel micrornatargeted therapeutics to treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease regulus is a joint venture between alnylam pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq alny and isis pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq isis the alliance leverages regulus unique expertise and intellectual property position in the discovery and development of micrornatargeted therapeutics and provides gsk with an option to license product candidates directed at four different microrna targets with relevance in inflammatory disease regulus will be responsible for the discovery and development of the microrna antagonists through completion of clinical proof of concept unless gsk chooses to exercise its option earlier after exercise of the option gsk will have an exclusive license to drugs developed under each program by regulus for the relevant microrna target for further development and commercialization on a worldwide basis regulus will have the right to further develop and commercialize any microrna therapeutics which gsk chooses not to develop or commercialize regulus will receive  million in upfront payments from gsk including a  million option fee and a  million note guaranteed by isis and alnylam that will convert into regulus common stock in the future under certain specified circumstances regulus could also be eligible to receive up to  million in development regulatory and sales milestone payments for each of the four micrornatargeted therapeutics discovered and developed as part of the alliance in addition to the potential of nearly  million regulus could receive in option license and milestone payments regulus would also receive tiered royalties up to double digits on worldwide sales of products resulting from the alliance we are focused on finding innovative medicines through both internal efforts and by virtualizing a portion of the inflammatory diseases pipeline we are very excited to be working   g   with regulus and exploring the therapeutic opportunities in inflammation offered by targeting micrornas an exciting new area of biology said jose carlos gutierrezramos phd senior vice president and head of the immunoinflammation center of excellence for drug discovery of gsk when associated with an aberrant inflammatory response micrornas represent disease targets whose therapeutic modulation could revolutionize the way we treat immune diseases and provide benefits not readily achievable with todays medicines gsk is an outstanding partner for regulus and we look forward to expanding our efforts in inflammation where a new class of therapeutics could offer novel options to treat disease said kleanthis g xanthopoulos phd president and chief executive officer of regulus microrna therapeutics represent an exciting new frontier for pharmaceutical research opening many opportunities including those present in inflammation and immune diseases as a leading microrna therapeutics company regulus has the expertise and access to proprietary antisense technologies which provide the tools and potential to quickly move therapeutic programs toward the clinic through its relationship with alnylam and isis regulus also has a vast patent estate in micrornas about micrornas micrornas are a recently discovered class of genetically encoded small rnas approximately  nucleotides in length and are believed to regulate the expression of a large number of human genes microrna therapeutics represent a new approach for the treatment of a wide range of human diseases the inappropriate absence or presence of specific micrornas in various cells has been shown to be associated with specific human diseases including cancer viral infection and metabolic disorders targeting micrornas with novel therapeutic agents could result in highimpact and broadly acting treatments for human diseases
