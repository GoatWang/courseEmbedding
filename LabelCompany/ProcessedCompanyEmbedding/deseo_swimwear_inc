swimwear will be used on the beach as well as in general recreational settings we believe the deseo swimwear will become a recognized brand name in the dominican inspired swimwear category founded in april of  we have cultivated our proposed brand image through a variety of innovative designs we plan to have our swimwear manufactured in the dominican republic and the united states to the highest specifications in quality performance and styling   since our inception of april   we have started prelaunch operations beginning with the designing of our first line of swimwear under the brand name dsseries we have also initiated the design of our website and begun sourcing thirdparty manufacturers to produce our swimwear line   we were incorporated on april   under the laws of the state of nevada our principal offices are located at  k street – unit  san diego california  our telephone number is           the offering   securities being offered up to  shares of common stock     offering price the selling shareholders will sell our shares at  per share until our shares are quoted on the otcqb and thereafter at prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices we determined this offering price based upon the price of the last sale of our common stock to investors     terms of the offering the selling shareholders will determine when and how they will sell the common stock

registration statement relating to this prospectus we hope to have a market maker file an application with finra for our common stock to become eligible for trading on the otcbb or otcqb we do not yet have a market maker who has agreed to file such application there is no assurance that a trading market will develop or if developed that it will be sustained consequently a purchaser of our common stock may find it difficult to resell the securities offered herein should the purchaser desire to do so   summary financial information   the following financial information summarizes the more complete historical financial information at the end of this prospectus       as of december   balance sheet     total assets       total liabilities       stockholders equity                   for the period from april   inception to december     statement of operations         revenue       total operating expenses       net loss               risk factors   an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this prospectus before investing in our common stock if any of the following risks occur our business operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment   there is substantial doubt as to whether we will continue operations if we discontinue operations you could lose your investment   we have no operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made our net loss since inception is  these factors raise substantial doubt regarding the ability of our business to continue as a going concern we anticipate that we will incur increased expenses without realizing enough revenues we therefore expect to incur significant losses in the foreseeable future our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to access the swimwear retail and online market with our proposed swimwear designs we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating revenues and profit in the future failure to generate revenues and profit will cause us to suspend or cease operations if this happens you could lose all or part of your investment   if we do not obtain additional financing our business will fail   while at december   we had cash on hand of  and we have had  in expenses since inception at this rate we expect that we will only be able to continue operations for one year without additional funding we anticipate that additional funding will be needed for general administrative expenses purchasing of amusement machines and related advertising costs we have not generated any revenue from operations to date in order to expand our business operations we anticipate that we will have to raise additional funding if we are not able to raise the capital necessary to fund our business expansion objectives we may have to delay the implementation of our business plan we do not currently have any arrangements for financing obtaining additional funding will be subject to a number of factors including general market conditions investor acceptance of our business plan and initial results from our business operations these factors may impact the timing amount terms or conditions of additional financing available to us the most likely source of future funds available to us is through the sale of additional shares of common stock or advances from our sole director   because we have commenced limited business operations we face a high risk of business failure   we were incorporated on april   and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities we have not earned revenues as of the date of this prospectus and have incurred total losses of  from our incorporation to december   accordingly you cannot evaluate our business and therefore our future prospects due to a lack of operating history potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by development stage companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises in addition there is no guarantee that we will be able to expand our business operations even if we expand our operations at present we do not know precisely when this will occur          we may in the future issue additional shares of common stock which would reduce investors percent of ownership and may dilute our share value   our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of  shares of common stock par value  per share of which  shares are issued and outstanding the future issuance of common stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing shareholders we may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis the issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock   because our sole officer and director own  of our outstanding common stock they will make and control corporate decisions that may be disadvantageous to minority shareholders   our sole officer and director own  of the outstanding shares of our common stock accordingly they will have significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters including the election of directors mergers consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control the interests of ms cope may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and may result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders   because our sole officer and director have other business interests they may not be able or willing to devote a sufficient amount of time to our business operations causing our business to fail   our officers and sole director will only be devoting limited time to our operations suzanne renee cope our sole officer and director intends to devote approximately  of her business time to our affairs because our sole officer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to them as a result operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a possible cessation of operations it is possible that the demands on suzanne renee cope from her other obligations could increase with the result that they would no longer be able to devote sufficient time to the management of our business in addition ms cope may not possess sufficient time for our business if the demands of managing our business increase substantially beyond current levels   if suzanne renee cope our sole officer and director should resign or die we will not have a chief executive officer that could result in our operations suspending if that should occur you could lose your investment   we are extremely dependent on the services of our sole officer and director suzanne renee cope for the future success of our business the loss of the services of ms cope could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if she should resign or die we will not have a chief executive officer if that should occur until we find another person to act as our chief executive officer our operations could be suspended in that event it is possible you could lose your entire investment          because we have our sole officer and director who has no formal training in financial accounting and managenent who is responsible for our managerial and organizational structure in the future there may not be effctive disclosure and accounting controls to comply with applicable laws and regulations which could result in fines penalties and assessments against us   our sole officer and director has no formal training in financial accounting and management however she is responsible for our managerial and organizational structure which will include preparation of disclosure and accounting controls while ms cope has no formal training in financial accounting matters she has been reviewing the financial statements that have been audited and reviewed by our auditors and included in this prospectus when the disclosure and accounting controls referred to above are implemented she will be responsible for the administration of them should she not have sufficient experience she may be incapable of creating and implementing the controls which may cause us to be subject to sanctions and fines by the sec which ultimately could cause you to lose your investment however because of the small size of our expected operations we believe that she will be able to monitor the controls she will have created and will be accurate in assembling and providing information to investors   our president and chief executive offier does not have any formal training specific to the swimwear business   our president and chief executive officer is suzanne renee cope she is also the principal designer of the companys proposed swimwear line ms cope has no direct training or experience in designing developing and marketing a swimwear product business for the general market place our management team may not be fully aware of the specific requirements related to working within this industry consequently our operations earnings and ultimate financial success could suffer irreparable harm due to managements lack of experience in this industry   our competition is intense in all phases of our busines if we are unable to attract enough customers to purchase our swimwear our business will fail   the swimwear market is includes major brands such as victoria secret speedo catalina and jantzen it also has many boutique and specialty online retail outlets such cali dreaming giejo sea dreamer and triangl to name a few they are many online avenues to purchase swimwear products as well as through clothing retail outlets and swimwear specialty stores nearly all of our competitors are more experienced have vastly greater financial and management resources and have more established proprietary trademarks and distribution networks than we do these and other competitors are likely to have distribution channels for their products that we do not have which places us at a significant disadvantage failure of the company to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions and the results of our operations if we are unable to attract enough customers our business will fail   we intend to have our proposed swimwear to be manufactured by suppliers in the dominican republic and india our ability to ear revenues could be disrupted in any of our suppliers decide they no longer desire to provide us with our product   our initial swimwear designs we intended to be source our manufacturing from the dominican republic and india we have not entered into any supply agreements with any potential suppliers of swimwear we expected to rely on a minimal number of suppliers for our product for the foreseeable future in the event that any of our suppliers no longer desire to provide products we may be forced to locate alternative suppliers we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain our products from alternative suppliers failure to obtain alternative sources will disrupt our operations and hinder our ability to generate revenues          our shares of common stock are subject to the penny stock rules of the securities and exchange commission and the trading market in our securities will be limited which will make transactions in our stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our stock   the sec has adopted rules that regulate brokerdealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the nasdaq system provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the sec which specifies information about penny stocks and the nature and significance of risks of the penny stock market a brokerdealer must also provide the customer with bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and sales person in the transaction and monthly account statements indicating the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules the brokerdealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction these disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for stock that becomes subject to those penny stock rules if a trading market for our common stock develops our common stock will probably become subject to the penny stock rules and shareholders may have difficulty in selling their shares    we are an emerging growth company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth company will make our common stock less attractive to investors   we are an emerging growth company as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act of  and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile   under the jumpstart our business startups act emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves to this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and therefore we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies   when our shares of common stock commence trading on the otcbb or the otcqb the trading price may fluctuate significantly and stockholders may have difficulty reselling their shares    as of the date of this registration statement our common stock does not yet trade on the otcbb or qtcqb when our shares of common stock commence trading on the otcbb or qtcqb there is a volatility associated with otcbb or otcqb securities in general and the value of your investment could decline due to the impact of any of the following factors upon the market price of our common stock i disappointing results from our development efforts ii failure to meet our revenue or profit goals or operating budget iii decline in demand for our common stock iv downward revisions in securities analysts estimates or changes in general market conditions v technological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies vi lack of funding generated for operations vii investor perception of our industry or our prospects and viii general economic trends   in addition stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of securities have been highly volatile these fluctuations are often unrelated to operating performance and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock as a result investors may be unable to sell their shares at a fair price and you may lose all or part of your investment          there is no current trading market for our securities and if a trading market does not develop purchasers of our securities may have difficulty selling their shares   there is currently no established public trading market for our securities and an active trading market in our securities may not develop or if developed may not be sustained we intend to have a market maker apply for admission to quotation of our securities on the otcbb or otcqb after the registration statement relating to this prospectus is declared effective by the sec we do not yet have a market maker who has agreed to file such application if for any reason our common stock is not quoted on the otcbb or otcqb or a public trading market does not otherwise develop purchasers of the share may have difficult selling their common stock should they desire to do so no market makers have committed to becoming market makers for our common stock and none may do so   we have no experience as a public company   we have never operated as a public company we have no experience in complying with the various rules and regulations which are required of a public company as a result we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company even if our operations are successful we plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations which are required of a public company however if we cannot operate successfully as a public company your investment may be adversely affected our inability to operate as a public company could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us   we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeble future   we have never paid any dividends on our common stock we do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock at any time in the foreseeable future the future payment of dividends directly depends upon our future earnings capital requirements financial requirements and other factors that our board of directors will consider since we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock a return on your investment if any will depend solely on an increase in any in the market value of our common stock   forwardlooking statements   this prospectus contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties we use words such as anticipate believe plan expect future intend and similar expressions to identify such forwardlooking statements you should not place too much reliance on these forwardlooking statements our actual results are most likely to differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements for many reasons including the risks faced by us described in the risk factors section and elsewhere in this prospectus   use of proceeds   we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock offered through this prospectus by the selling shareholders          determination of offering price   the selling shareholders will sell our shares at  per share until our shares are quoted on the otcqb and thereafter at prevailing market prices or privately negotiated prices the offering price of the shares has been determined arbitrarily by us the price does not bear any relationship to our assets book value earnings or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company there is no assurance of when if ever our stock will be listed on an exchange   dilution   the common stock to be sold by the selling shareholders is common stock that is currently issued and outstanding accordingly there will be no dilution to our
