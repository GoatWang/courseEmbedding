tweet email print  print  email this article to please enter your email address subject comments at first glance mastercard’s core business model would seem enviable it collects a fee on every payment it processes but while martina hundmejean who became cfo last year appreciates “the high profitability of this sector” she’s quick to add a cautionary note “we can never put our head in the sand” hundmejean is constantly scanning the horizon for signs of what’s ahead in terms of both technology and competition what market segment will attract new rivals and where will they spring from what device is likely to replace traditional credit cards hint you’re probably carrying one right now and with the economy forcing consumers to cut back on discretionary spending how long will it be before mastercard holders hesitate to plop down their cards so freely hundmejean doesn’t have the answers but she’s well trained to look for them a product of general motors’s rigorous treasury program she assumed increasingly demanding finance positions at gm before serving as treasurer and senior vice president at tyco international that broad experience will no doubt come in handy at mastercard as economic uncertainties pile up as steadily as well creditcard solicitations from banks you have said that you are constantly thinking about strategy and ways to stay on the leading edge is that a new focus we are focusing on strategic planning in a renewed way now that the company is two years out of an initial public offering we have a nineperson executive committee that consists of our ceo bob selander business partners unit leaders and myself we meet every week for an hour and a half and one full day a month it’s a great team recommended stories the world bank’s vincenzo la via charles schwab’s joseph martinetto microsoft’s chris liddell mastercard faces some interesting challenges for instance the house judiciary committee recently approved a bill that would require creditcard companies to negotiate fees with merchants rather than letting the banks set those rates how would the credit card fair fee act affect mastercard if the bill passes it will harm consumers australia passed regulations slashing these “interchange fees” about five years ago and it is clear that consumers have been hurt through higher fees and fewer rewards merchants are paying lower fees but there is no evidence that they have lowered the prices they charge consumers the result was completely contrary to what the legislators wanted to accomplish what about the technological hurdles ahead will cell phones ever replace plastic cards in the united states mastercard’s tapandgo wireless paypass technology has enabled us to lead the development of the communication standard around contactless payments for the industry which ensures that cards and terminals supporting all contactlesspayment brands are globally interoperable this has led to the transformation of mobile phones into secure contactlesspayment devices we have been working with telecom providers and industry organizations to ensure that standards are met as mobile phones move to the center of commerce see “cash credit or cell phone“ as of today we have announced about  mobile pilots across all major regions what else is mastercard doing to differentiate itself from its competitors we differentiate ourselves in three main areas one we can customtailor our products to fit a partner’s particular need for example lufthansa wants to make sure its frequent flyers are really using their credit cards and are having a unique experience like going faster through security we made a card for them to do that we placed a paypass feature on the cards so that users can make lastminute purchases at the airport number two we are truly global with about  percent of our revenues generated outside the united states if we develop a new product in one part of the world we can deploy it in other parts of the world our third unique competency is our professionalservices arm mastercard advisors through that group we provide information consulting and outsourcing services to our customers the banks will mastercard’s future business model look entirely different unlike many other industries the global payments industry is still in its infancy cash and checks are still the predominant forms of payment in many global economies and this translates into tremendous opportunities for us to grow given all the areas you have to be involved in at mastercard is there one that you find especially exciting i have a passion for strategy whichever proposition we’re looking at i put it in the context of “what does it mean for mastercard” — not only today but years from now i’m constantly focused on what are we missing what are we not thinking about what is it that we don’t know and how do we learn about it how do you figure out what you don’t know from a finance perspective you have to do a number of things first be very connected to the businesspeople in the company and be on top of where the business is moving or can move to having a finance group that is well connected and embedded in the business is key to this second be connected to other external sources that provide objective input to shape the company’s strategy and third engage in a constant debate on possible scenarios and prepare the company to either take advantage of those or make defensive moves what skills do you think an aspiring cfo needs most cfos can come from various backgrounds they’ll need to develop expertise in areas like financial planning and analysis it helps if you have been the controller of a unit run a subsidiary and have ma tax and audit experience by growing up through the general motors treasurer’s office i
