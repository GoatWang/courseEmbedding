design workshop – grand prize november th  awards commentsin  the founders of mf fire entered a wood stove design competition sponsored by the alliance for green heat this wood stove decathlon challenged teams of engineers to provide an innovative design and our entry garnered the prize for low emissionsthe follow up to the very successful wood stove decathlon was held in november  at brookhaven national laboratory the goal of these competitions is to solve consumer  industry pain points for example many consumers do not operate wood stoves well often using the wrong wood also the epa has not raised is standards in many years for fear that the industry would not be able to meet them and these competitions jumpstart innovationthe mf fire founders entered an improved version of the  mulciber prototype to compete against four other finalists this time the stove was judged not only for its emissions but also for efficiency innovation market appeal and safety the mulciber achieved top marks taking first place overall as well as first place in the categories of particulate emissions and innovationas one example the mulciber adapted technology used for vehicles to improve safety in the use of wood stoves an oxygen sensor which regulates the fueltoair ratio in an engine is used to achieve the perfect burn even with unseasoned wood the wood stove performed quite well compared to the competitors and the existing products in the market as a result consumers do not have to load wood as often saving time and money“we want to congratulate the mf fire team – and all the teams – for participating in a process of sharing innovation ideas and test results” said john ackerly coordinator of the event and president of the alliance for green heat  “these stoves have many of the solutions to excessive smoke from modernday wood stoves and are challenging the epa and the stove industry to catch up with new technologies and new opportunities” ackerly said view the
