september   michele morin warren maine age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  for the reader who writes or for the writer who reads certain authors are a gold mine with a bracing vocabulary a precision of thought and a way with a sentence that manages to be both wise and witty david bentley hart has a perspective on the world that requires a careful reading that is wellrewarded in a splendid wickedness a collection of fiftytwo occasional essays i recorded a list of twentyfour completely unfamiliar words not including all those that i recognized but have only admired from afar although i prefer a traditional book to my kindle for most reading ereaders might have been invented for this caliber of writing because of their ready access to a dictionary since i had to look up my new words the oldfashioned way i will treat you to my five favorites autochthonous indigenous formed in the place where it is found bedizen to dress or adorn gaudily sidereal of our relating to stars or constellations orgulous proud eidetic marked by extraordinarily accurate and vivid recall youre welcome the journey through a splendid wickedness covers terrain as diverse as the virtues of idleness capital punishment baseball book reviews and a series of philosophical ponderings delivered in a warm and furry tone by harts dog roland the title track essay  examines literary characters don juan and don quixote and wonders aloud why the figure of quixote has been borne aloft by his beautiful and mysterious timelessness while juan has become pass swerving from literary to cultural criticism hart concludes that because we have in our time lost our appreciation for a transcendent good and because our culture is not subject to the torments of immutable moral laws there can be no such thing as splendid wickedness simply because if we do not see ourselves in the light of the good beyond being nothing in our nature can be cast in sufficiently striking relief it is this sort of cogent thinking that shows up in bents thoughts on various topics the wonderful thing about holiness when you really encounter it is that it testifies to itself all that is needed to make even the most outlandish theory seem plausible to the truly doctrinaire materialist is that it come wrapped in the appurtenances of empirical science    the worst fate that could befall america one far grimmer than the mere loss of some of its fiscal or political supremacy in the world would be the final triumph of a true cultural secularism having read straight through all fiftytwo essays my impulse now is to put the book on my nightstand with amy carmichael luci shaw madeleine lengle and elisabeth elliot for a slower read a takeoneweeklyforayearprescription for an infusion of fine writing and sharp thinking in my favorite essays the author shinnies out onto some of the shakier limbs of his family tree finding there a practicing pagan complete with sacrifices to janus on a marble altar a bronzed severed left thumb a relic from a chance amputation in a formal duel and a metaphysical materialist who was obsessed with death as for me my ancestral roots run all gnarly into northern maine and the canadian maritimes a people who expressed themselves in ways both understated and forceful after an aspirated pause im sure they would have pronounced harts book to be wicked
