is an american publicly traded retail chain of party supply stores founded in  by steve mandell in east hanover new jersey based in elmsford new york the company is the largest retailer of party goods in the united states and canada operating over  companyowned and franchise outlets under the party city halloween city and factory card  party outlet brands contents  history  acquisitions  philanthropy  references  external links historyedit founded by steve mandell in  mandell recognized that party goods was highly fragmented with a lot of small momandpop operations a large number of retailers carrying limited supplies and no big players dominating the market mandell decided to specialize in the business when he struck out on his own to realize his longcherished goal of running his own retail operation after scraping together  he opened a  square feet  m store in east hanover new jersey naming it party city the operation was immediately successful and within a year mandell started planning for a second location he also began to hear from people asking to franchise the party city concept and as a result party city began its evolution into a national chain after his first year in business mandell also decided to concentrate on halloween so that in  a quarter of his store was turned into a halloween costume warehouse the move proved highly successful and led to the companys ongoing focus on the holiday and the major impact that the month of october would have on the companys bottom line yearround party city stocked an inventory of halloween costumes if for no other reason than to make customers aware of the items for the next halloween season the first party city franchise store opened in  in hazlet nj and by  mandell also owned four party city stores at this point he incorporated the business as a franchising operation with his stores forming the core of the chain by the end of  party city outlets numbered  five more franchised stores were added in   in  and another  in  bringing the total to  party city was now a nationwide chain with store locations ranging from hawaii to puerto rico the companys annual revenues in  topped  million and net profits approached  during these first four years of operation mandell refined the party city concept including store design product mix choice of suppliers and the implementation of systems with a successful store model in hand mandell in late  decided to deemphasize franchising in favor of opening companyowned stores which would generate greater returns for the corporation than it could receive on fees and royalties from franchised outlets as well as allow mandell to better control the destiny of party city while franchisees might maintain a tighter control on inventory mandell was insistent that companyowned units would be amply stocked with a wide range of merchandise acquisitionsedit in  the company was sold to amscan holdings inc the largest designer manufacturer and

of revs a significant earnings warning on the q call would likely push shares close to the pt or possibly lower to extreme bear case  company overview party city holdco inc nyseprty designs manufactures sources and distributes party supplies in the us and internationally the company operates in two segments – retail and wholesale the company offered its products through its  stores  franchise stores in the us and canada under the party city and halloween city names and an ecommerce website partycitycom ticker prty  stock price    market cap bn  short interest  first the bull case dominant market share  of estimated  billion us party supply industry  stores including franchises new market opportunities international growth mexico presence to increase from five stores in  to  stores in  alternative markets opportunity to grow wholesale revenues by selling party goods to theaters theme parks etc vertical integrationpenetration of retail  wholesale  manufacturing value chain expected to increase from  to  and drive bps of gross margin improvement attractive valuation x  earnings   fcf yield x  evebitda on the surface these factors suggest prty is a good investment this is reflected in a relatively low short interest for a brick and mortar retailer in the current environment and makes prty an out of consensus short however a detailed analysis suggests that there is significant risk bear case prty is on the cusp of losing significant market share ecommerce prty derives just  of sales online management believes that this is because it “offers a fun and unique destination shopping experience creating a strong and growing need for brick and mortar” slide  of  icr conference our view is that this is simply not true parents planning a frozen themed birthday for their sevenyearold daughter are far more likely to prefer purchasing online rather than deal with the trials of bringing their young child to a brick and mortar store a search for “frozen party supplies” on amazon nasdaqamzn turned up  results and prty would not be the first retailer to get “amazoned” however the risks don’t stop there warren buffett’s berkshire hathaway nysebrka nysebrkb purchased key competitor oriental trading in  even though prty was clearly for sale and was purchased by thl that same year mr buffett was clearly onto something as oriental trading stated at the time of the acquisition that it was already generating  of its revenues online today oriental trading appears to be as competitive as ever a quick search of “frozen party supplies” found the following oriental trading features prominently at the top with a large selection of frozen themed party supplies owning  of google shopping listings prty holds only one text ad even more alarming there are plenty of other sites that are competitive on consumer research site wwwknojicom prty ranks th in overall quality on a list of  online party goods suppliers pricing prty is simply not competitive on pricing a quick search around the web shows that there are quality options available to consumers at a fraction of the prices listed at prty sticking with the frozen theme we compared frozen party supplies on amazon and on wwwpartycitycom management has highlighted its party kits which essentially bundle a set of party supplies for consumers to help them avoid purchasing random quantities of cups napkins utensils etc a la carte it seemed like a good idea but the competition has clearly caught up amazon sells the kit for  including shipping compared to  the  difference can essentially be attributed to  latex balloons and some candles unfortunately those balloons actually come with a disclaimer as shown in image that they are a choking hazard for children under  and will require adult supervision our view is that child birthday parties are stressful enough for most parents and they may prefer to save  while avoiding the risk of serious bodily harm to their children we tried many other searches for basic party supplies and there were materially cheaper alternatives to prty readily available online in all instances most significantly so halloween prty still derives approximately  of annual sales from halloween primarily costumes management attributes weak october  comps  due to a calendar shift from saturday in  to monday in  there is obviously some impact but considering october  comps were only up  twoyear comps of  are alarming of course management attributed uninspiring  comps to “tough” frozen comps the reality is competition is increasingly encroaching on prty’s most important source of revenue as evidence we point to the national retail federation nrf estimated that halloween spending actually hit a new high in  of  billion compared to  billion in  and  billion in  the nrf further suggests that costumes were a key contributor to growth but prty clearly underperformed another quick search for “anna girl’s costume” at wwwpartycitycom and amazon produces some alarming results some little girls might argue that they get a pink cape from pcty but note that the cape is sold separately  before shipping this leaves an applestoapples price difference of over   vs  on one of the most popular halloween costumes and likely serves as a better explanation of recent challenges alternative markets and international growth are challenging and do not move the needle mexico prty is placing significant emphasis on international growth and mexico in particular the asset light approach is a positive but success is far from certain based on google trends mindshare of party city in mexico continues to trend lower despite management commentary and the recent acquisition of an  stake in granmark all told wholesale international revenues have increased just  per annum from  million in fy to  million in fy despite years of management hype foreign exchange headwinds have contributed to this slow growth rate but even an abatement there is highly unlikely to accelerate overall corporate revenue growth it’s also important to note that ecommerce is a global phenomenon and the same headwinds facing prty in the us are also likely to exist in mexico as well as other key international markets such as australia and the uk new markets sellside analysts have been fixated on selling through new points of sale such as movie theaters management has oozed enthusiasm about this opportunity as shown in this exchange in q  but after conjuring a castle in the sky management appears to backtrack a quarter later q  in essence management went from implying that there is a “huge” new market opportunity to conceding it may sell a few extra balloons to frozen obsessed little girls at movie theaters even assuming the  growth rate were to persist it would only contribute a “huge”  million in additional revenue or just under  in reality even this is unlikely given the initial euphoria for frozen and sell into new points of sale are more likely to plateau vertical integration is not enough management has gone to great lengths expand wholesale distribution and acquire manufacturing capacity to some extent the strategy appears to have worked gross margins increased from  in fy to  in fy by comparison peer michaels companies has seen gross margins contract from  in fy to  in fy unfortunately progress has clearly slowed in recent years prty’s gross margins already reached  in fy which is not significantly different from today despite a continued ramp in vertical integration from  in fy to  in fy in a blue sky scenario management sees an additional bps of gross margin expansion in retail stores  of revenues when prty is fully integrated additional initiatives such as the acquisition of a new manufacturing facility in madagascar will help but prty appears to be bringing a knife to a gunfight any efficiency gains will likely need to be entirely traded away to remain competitive on price prty also benefited in fy from exceptionally depressed input costs particularly resins and diesel the high level of vertical integration likely allowed the company to better capture deflationary raw material benefits than peers however this dynamic has already begun to reverse and will put additional pressure on gross margins going forward on balance we think it’s reasonable to assume margins remain flat in fy as pushes ahead with additional manufacturing capacity by fy headwinds are expected to overwhelm efficiency and margins should begin a long march lower valuation markets appear to be pricing virtually none of the many risks and are instead fixated on the bull case our model better reflects the true state of prty’s business based on peer multiples ranging from x to x  earnings elevated leverage and deteriorating metrics we estimate prty should trade at  downside if business deteriorates faster than expected shares could trade at  in the next  months other risks potential risks to earnings outlook highly levered x ebitda with  floating rate debt high pe ownership  th lee  advent significant management turnover new cfo new evp of retail conclusion prty is a structurally impaired business and will not adapt to rapidly evolving industry dynamics it has chosen to focus on growth vectors that are proving difficult to execute and unlikely to accelerate sales growth as a result the company looks set to be a share donor and not a share gainer margins are also likely to be under pressure due to the significant gap to competitor pricing we expect domestic same store sales will likely continue to deteriorate and not accelerate as management has suggested editors note this is a republication of an entry in the sohn investment idea contest all figures are current as of the entrys

city canada halloween city website wwwpartycitycom wwwpartycityca party city is an american publicly traded retail chain of party supply stores founded in  by steve mandell in east hanover new jersey based in elmsford new york the company is the largest retailer of party goods in the united states and canada operating over  companyowned and franchise outlets under the party city halloween city and factory card  party outlet brands contents  history  acquisitions  philanthropy  references  external links historyedit founded by steve mandell in  mandell recognized that party goods was highly fragmented with a lot of small momandpop operations a large number of retailers carrying limited supplies and no big players dominating the market mandell decided to specialize in the business when he struck out on his own to realize his longcherished goal of running his own retail operation after scraping together  he opened a  square feet  m store in east hanover new jersey naming it party city the operation was immediately successful and within a year mandell started planning for a second location he also began to hear from people asking to franchise the party city concept and as a result party city began its evolution into a national chain after his first year in business mandell also decided to concentrate on halloween so that in  a quarter of his store was turned into a halloween costume warehouse the move proved highly successful and led to the companys ongoing focus on the holiday and the major impact that the month of october would have on the companys bottom line yearround party city stocked an inventory of halloween costumes if for no other reason than to make customers aware of the items for the next halloween season the first party city franchise store opened in  in hazlet nj and by  mandell also owned four party city stores at this point he incorporated the business as a franchising operation with his stores forming the core of the chain by the end of  party city outlets numbered  five more franchised stores were added in   in  and another  in  bringing the total to  party city was now a nationwide chain with store locations ranging from hawaii to puerto rico the companys annual revenues in  topped  million and net profits approached  during these first four years of operation mandell refined the party city concept including store design product mix choice of suppliers and the implementation of systems with a successful store model in hand mandell in late  decided to deemphasize franchising in favor of opening companyowned stores which would generate greater returns for the corporation than it could receive on fees and royalties from franchised outlets as well as allow mandell to better control the destiny of party city while franchisees might maintain a tighter control on inventory mandell was insistent that companyowned units would be amply stocked with a wide range of merchandise acquisitionsedit in  the company was sold to amscan

party city halloween city and factory card  party outlet brands contents  history  acquisitions  philanthropy  references  external links historyedit founded by steve mandell in  mandell recognized that party goods was highly fragmented with a lot of small momandpop operations a large number of retailers carrying limited supplies and no big players dominating the market mandell decided to specialize in the business when he struck out on his own to realize his longcherished goal of running his own retail operation after scraping together  he opened a  square feet  m store in east hanover new jersey naming it party city the operation was immediately successful and within a year mandell started planning for a second location he also began to hear from people asking to franchise the party city concept and as a result party city began its evolution into a national chain after his first year in business mandell also decided to concentrate on halloween so that in  a quarter of his store was turned into a halloween costume warehouse the move proved highly successful and led to the companys ongoing focus on the holiday and the major impact that the month of october would have on the companys bottom line yearround party city stocked an inventory of halloween costumes if for no other reason than to make customers aware of the items for the next halloween season the first party city franchise store opened in  in hazlet nj and by  mandell also owned four party city stores at this point he incorporated the business as a franchising operation with his stores forming the core of the chain by the end of  party city outlets numbered  five more franchised stores were added in   in  and another  in  bringing the total to  party city was now a nationwide chain with store locations ranging from hawaii to puerto rico the companys annual revenues in  topped  million and net profits approached  during these first four years of operation mandell refined the party city concept including store design product mix choice of suppliers and the implementation of systems with a successful store model in hand mandell in late  decided to deemphasize franchising in favor of opening companyowned stores which would generate greater returns for the corporation than it could receive on fees and royalties from franchised outlets as well as allow mandell to better control the destiny of party city while franchisees might maintain a tighter control on inventory mandell was insistent that companyowned units would be amply stocked with a wide range of merchandise

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf

with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
