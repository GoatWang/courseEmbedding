ratings  roofstock buy properties sell properties learn blog markets financing neighborhoods news about us what we do our team press reviews partners sign up welcome to the neighborhood confidently evaluate and compare different neighborhoods with our proprietary datadriven roofstock neighborhood rating the rental home is important but so is location whether you live around the corner or across the country understanding the characteristics of a neighborhood is crucial to determining investment appeal that’s why roofstock created the roofstock neighborhood rating a powerful algorithm that normalizes neighborhood data across markets and enables you to compare investment properties on an even footing this dynamic system measures a dozen key attributes including school district quality home values employment rates income levels and other vital investment criteria empowering rental home investors to quickly and confidently make an informed purchase decision   use the roofstock neighborhood rating to measure investment risk against potential return star star star star star neighborhood profile this is the most affluent type of neighborhood on our rating scale with higherincome residents and newer homes far above the median price the school districts in this area are toprated and highly desirable risks  rewards homes in upscale neighborhoods come at a steeper purchase price resulting in higher entry costs upfront and lower initial yield however properties in star neighborhoods can have lower operational risks and better renter stability get  star properties neighborhood profile these medium to highincome neighborhoods aren’t as upscale as areas with  stars but possess similar attributes homes here are generally of high quality and the surrounding school districts are very good risks  rewards buyers looking for quality homes in an area with more manageable entry costs than star neighborhoods should consider star neighborhoods yields are generally higher than in star areas but lower than in star neighborhoods since rent is typically a lower percentage of the property value for these more expensive homes get  star properties neighborhood profile for buyers who prefer a little variety star neighborhoods tend to have more inventory than their  and star counterparts these areas typically have decent school districts above average income levels and boast a blend of newer and older homes risks  rewards these listings often strike a good balance for buyers between risk and reward it’s easier to find properties in star neighborhoods at median price points with more attractive yields which can compensate for the somewhat higher risk presented by tenants with lower incomes get  star properties neighborhood profile this is a lowerincome neighborhood with an even mix of owner and renteroccupied homes homes in star neighborhoods are generally older and local school district quality is below average risks  rewards with lower purchase prices come more opportunity for positive cash flow so buyers looking to see higher yields should explore star neighborhoods however these neighborhoods tend to have older homes and sometimes have greater variability of cash flow driven by renter instability get  star properties neighborhood profile this is a lowincome area with older homes and a low average school rating compared to higherranking areas star neighborhoods have the greatest amount of renteroccupied properties the lowest median income and highest renter instability risks  rewards at the lowest entry point for purchasers properties in star neighborhoods have the greatest risk as well as the greatest potential yield in star neighborhoods investors seeking higher potential returns should be willing to take on even greater probability for renter instability as well as volatility in asset values and cash flow get  star properties none of the above should be considered investment advice your results may differ please consult your financial advisor prior to purchasing through the roofstock marketplace learn more star power put the roofstock neighborhood rating to work roofstock markets
