adopting this new model in this blog i will cover the components of the new crrm model and what you need to put in place to make this new model a reality ever wonder why companies like espn apple google zynga amazon and marriott dominate their respective markets the reason is that they are ‘customer first’ organizations and are passionate about listening to understanding and then delighting their customers based on leveraging true customer insights they treat their customers as business partners vs commodities and include them in many critical decision making processes they get this new crrm model whyhow  – read the rest of this blog to find out… the differences between the old crm model and how these companies are embracing the newer crrm model are depicted in the following chart the old crm model vs new crrm model – customers as business partners  customers are fed up with old dictatorial management style  want to be empowered as business partners customers and stakeholders today are longing for a company to partner with them and include them in the corporate decision making process  these same constituencies are sick and tired of political corporate and other organizations making unilateral decisions for them that are really not inline with their needs  wants etc the backlash from this unwanted dictatorial management style of some companies can be seen in the bank of america fee customer rebellion the customer backlash from netflix deciding to  split their company without first consulting with their customers and hps initial decision to exit the computer market  components of the new crrm model in order to progress your organization from the old crm model to the new crrm  model a few key essentials must be put in place and are as follows a new crrm model that includes the ° cultivation of customer  market insights  this model enables a ° view of all customer and market insights including customer feedback preferences likes dislikes social sentiment competitor activity etc this new model takes your insights to an entirely new level whereby you are now enabled to delight customers stakeholders and stockholders by having insights that are lightyears ahead of insights provided by a traditional crm model b customer first culture driven by management that is passionate about their customers including a set of customer first principles and guidelines developed by company leaders c customer ratings  feedback structure that will identify areas where you will collect customer ° feedback from customer and stakeholder interactions d customer feedback  preferences cultivation process and corresponding infrastructure in order to allow your customers to continually rate how well you are serving them e customer health scorecard that provides realtime insights on how well the customers stakeholders and stockholders perceives you as serving them as well as insights into a continuous customer improvement process ccip that enables you to continually improve your customer perceptions satisfaction brand loyalty etc these components can apply to large enterprises as well as small to medium businesses smbs the following graphics are all sample components from the list above ad that need to be put in place to enable this new crrm model new crrm model – ° cultivation of customer  market insights  a the above chart “new crrm model –  cultivation of customer  market insights” demonstrates the new insights model that must be put in place to deliver worldclass stakeholder and customer programs these enhanced insights will enable you to deliver products and services that delight your customers stakeholders and stockholders as well as enable you to leapfrog the competition in terms of market share if they continue to rely on their antiquated crm data and analytics insights only model  for small to medium sized businesses smbs some of the insights do not apply but the following charts be most certainly apply and can be tracked via simple microsoft excel spreadsheets crrm customer first policies  organizational principles b the above chart “crrm organizational guiding principles” demonstrates the principles that must be inplace to be customer first culture this culture is driven by management that is passionate about their customers and governs the company around a set of customer first policies sample enterprise crrm customer rating  feedback structure c the above chart “enterprise crrm customer rating  feedback structure” illustrates a sample structure will vary for each type of business whereby customer feedback and preferences will be cultivated in order to develop ° insights into customer needs wants likes etc enterprise crrm customer feedback  preferences cultivation

company  customer benefits of adopting the crrm model by treating customers as business partners vs commodities and including them in the corporate decision making process as well as allowing them to rate how well you are serving them from an array of customer facing areas companies can reap huge rewards including the following  better insights into the types of products and services customers want  need  fiercely loyal customers who feel part of the corporate team  customers who are most likely to spend more be retained longer and purchase at premium prices with higher profit margins  customers who are very likely to be brand advocates and refer others to your company brands and services  customers who feel connected to the company and empowered to improve company operations the following are actual customer comments from those who have participated in a customer feedback program to help shape products  services “i feel like xyz company cares about me since they ask my opinion” “finally a company that listens to us” “it is so refreshing to have a company ask you your opinions on products and services vs ramming something down our throats that we don’t like” “wow – this is fun i enjoy providing my opinion” “as silly as this might sound xyz company is the only company that ever asked me what i wanted” “in my opinion xyz company is much more progressive than their competitors by seeking consumer opinions what matters to them etc   conclusion more dynamic companies like goodle zynga amazon etc are inviting customers to become part of the corporate decision making process and empowering them to provide feedback insights and rate company operations in order to drive continous customer improvements companies who adopt this new crrm model whereby company management is democratized by including stakeholders and customers into the decision making process will reap the rewards of ever higher customer acquisition retention and spend – leading to ever
