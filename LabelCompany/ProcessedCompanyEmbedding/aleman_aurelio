van execs reach plea deals in fraud scheme two of three former usa dry van execs reach plea deals in fraud scheme by greg grisolano land line staff writer  wednesday september 8  the former chief operations officer and the former controller of a crossborder trucking operation are expected to testify against the company’s ceo in a  million fraud case according to court documents in exchange for their testimony defendants aurelio “jim” alemanlongoria  and oscar barbosa  are expected to testify against their codefendant yearold sergio lagos the guilty pleas were entered sept  in the houston division of us district court southern district of texas alemanlongoria and barbosa are scheduled to be sentenced on dec  at which time they face up  years in prison and up to a  fine alemanlongoria is the former coo and barbosa the former controller for usa dry van logistics the pair along with the company’s owner and ceo lagos were each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and five counts of wire fraud federal prosecutors accused the men of cooking the books to ensure the flow of loan money the scheme eventually racked up  million in losses for ge capital corp – a subsidiary of general electric – one of the world’s largest companies from march  through january  lagos aleman and barbosa “schemed to conceal” the company’s declining profits and financial performance from lender gecc gecc subsequently loaned the company hundreds of thousands of dollars weekly through a line of revolving credit – including some money the company used to falsely represent its financial performance in january  usa dry van logistics had secured an increase of the line of credit to 8 million and the three defendants allegedly submitted falsified “borrowing base certificates” to gecc that inflated the company’s actual accounts receivable numbers lagos aleman and barbosa allegedly directed employees to doctor accounts receivable and forge invoices for dollar amounts that weren’t true when the truth about the company’s finances became public usadv reorganized under chapter  bankruptcy it is now operating under new ownership each count in the indictment carries a maximum penalty of  years in prison and a  fine according to the plea agreement alemanlongoria and barbosa admitted that from march  through the end of january  they joined in a scheme to defraud and swindle gecc by fraudulently obtaining funds through a revolving line of credit rather than reveal usadv’s true condition alemanlongoria and barbosa misrepresented usadv’s true operating performance and financial results to include the nature of the usadv’s accounts receivable against which gecc was permitting usadv to borrow hundreds of thousands of dollars on a weekly basis this caused usadv to appear to be operating more profitably that it actually was the codefendants also signed prepared or directed others to prepare certificates that falsely inflated the amount of the company’s accounts receivable enabling usadv to obtain more funds than would otherwise have been permitted other employees were directed to manually invoice millions of dollars of fraudulent receivables to inflate the borrowing base and to create false and forged invoices and support documentation for accounts receivables that did not exist alemanlongoria and barbosa also admitted to submitting false financial statements to auditors and gecc both aleman and barbosa also agreed to make monthly payments towards restitution to gecc prior to sentencing in aleman’s plea agreement he
