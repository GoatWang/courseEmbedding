valerio cfo for coinstar inc and glenn ayers partner at mercer discuss how coinstar has grown by addressing unmet customer needs and the importance of culture and nurturing an ecosystem in a company’s success  argyle journal argyle journal linkedin facebook google plus twitter cfo ‹ previous articlenext article ›× back to cfo articlesj scott di valerio cfo for coinstar inc and glenn ayers partner at mercer discuss how coinstar has grown by addressing unmet customer needs and the importance of culture and nurturing an ecosystem in a company’s success glenn ayers can you start by giving us a bit of background on coinstar scott di valerio coinstaris a leader in the automated retail space and we focus on going after an unmet demand by the consumer currently that means moving on the trends that you see in urbanization instant access technology and other ways where people want to be able to get the products they want when they want them and in a way that’s simple convenient and drives value for the overall business one of our two major brands is coinstar which is the green machine in front of the stores where you can convert your coins into cash itunes amazoncom cards or starbucks coffee cards the other is the redbox kiosk that allows you to rent dvds in a way that’s much more efficient and effective than the brickandmortar stores we like to say that at coinstar we’re reimaging retail we’re able to bring great products to consumers in a way that they like while also driving great value for us and our retail partners how did you arrive at coinstar i started with pricewaterhousecoopers eventually becoming a partner in the san diego office while also running the technology information communication and entertainment tice practice in the czech republic for a bit later i went to the walt disney company as a corporate vice president corporate controllership before moving to microsoft as corporate vice president and corporate controller later moving to cvp oem division from microsoft i went to a company called lenovo – which is now the number one pc manufacturer in the world – where i helped reposition some of the things that they were doing in the americas and launched a consumer brand for them they had a very strong consumer business in china and asia but nothing outside of that region so the ability to come in and launch a consumer brand was quite a lot of fun when the coinstar opportunity came up like most people i thought about the coin machine in the front of the store which was the initial business that started  years ago but after i talked with ceo paul davis and did some research on the company i found that there was also this redbox business that was changing how people rented their dvds and while it was good for consumers it wasn’t necessarily helping make friends with the studios it was a very fastgrowing but also controversial business they also had a vision to extend out the automated retail platform by bringing in concepts that would take over the growth mantel of coinstar and redbox over an extended period of time so there was a nice stable business in coinstar a fastgrowing and dynamic business in redbox and a new business arena in our ventures today it was a very interesting opportunity to come on and be able to drive more on both the cfo side as well as the operations side are there any experiences you’ve had at your previous companies that you’ve been able to draw on to help coinstar grow i’ve had a lot of great experiences throughout my career not necessarily all planned my time in san diego was helpful because i had a client base of startups some of which grew into relatively large companies and i was able to work with great entrepreneurs and see their success patterns and how they were able to evolve and drive sales with additional product lines and offerings meanwhile my time at walt disney and microsoft gave me experience with large brands while bringing great things to the marketplace both from an enterprise and retail perspective at lenovo i was able to use those experiences in transitioning our core business which has helped in evolving the coinstar business to make sure that as we look out five or ten years down the road what we’re doing is done from a strategic perspective as a result we make the decisions at the right time to evolve them but we also make the hard decisions about not overinvesting when businesses aren’t necessarily going to be successful you can fall in love with those businesses but you have to get the right return for shareholders there’s been a prevailing mood of caution that’s dominated the offices of cfos since the recession especially with the recent presidential election since coinstar was recognized by fortune as one of the world’s  fastestgrowing companies in  and  what are you doing differently and why is this working for you we’ve been pretty successful at focusing on the consumer first and then building businesses around their needs that goes back to when the business was started by a gentleman called jens molbak who was a grad student at stanford one night jens and his friends wanted to go out jens had a whole bunch of coins and he brought them to a bank which wouldn’t accept them unless they rolled them  he did his grad thesis on how to better monetize these coins and get them back into circulation when jens graduated that thesis turned into the coin business coinstar started as a way to meet an unmet consumer need with redbox the objective was to move away from a very costly rental experience in the brickandmortar stores rather than have consumers search through racks and racks of dvds we provide a redbox kiosk that’s in front of grocery stores or convenience stores where people can rent dvds as often as three times a week and at  it’s a great value we have been able to focus on those consumer patterns and also increase the traffic flows of retail partners our key principals there are that we grow top line as well as bottom line revenue it’s easy to grow top line revenue but it’s a little harder to grow both in the last three years though we’ve grown quite substantially from the top perspective while tripling our eps and we’ve increased our return on investment capital from  at the end of  to  at the end of  all through staying focused on driving growth and making those investments where we’re going to bring it to the bottom line so is there anything in particular that has allowed you to continue that growth over the past few years we provide value convenience and simplicity to our consumers and in times like this people especially want that roughly a billion people walk past our kiosks each and every month who want to convert their coins or get a dvd or a cup of coffee and the simplicity in doing that really resonates for them it also resonates with our retail partners because the small footprint of the redbox or coinstar machines is driving straight revenue and high profit with that being said there is still a lot of uncertainty around the future how are you going about managing the financial risk with that in mind our focus is on making sure that our investments in our new businesses and core businesses give the right return for our shareholders so we take a very disciplined approach it’s great to keep investing in these businesses but the shareholders need to see a nice return as well as the way forward the coin business is stable and able to grow in a way that makes sense for example we are partnering with paypal so that when you put your coins in you can load a paypal account that opens up a whole new opportunity for our underbanked or nonbanked customers to open up a paypal account and begin transacting with our web merchants which is an opportunity for us as well with redbox we’ve got more than  kiosks out there and a dvd business that depending on who you talk to is either going away tomorrow or will be around another  years so we set up a team and said let’s assume that in xnumber of years the dvd business will be in decline how are we going to monetize both the redbox brand’s convenience and simplicity as well as leverage those kiosks that are out there for an extended period of time past when dvds are around  that team then researched and did a whole bunch of testing to arrive at about five different ideas that they wanted to bring to market to test the one we put in the lead was the ticket business which gives the ability to go and buy tickets to local events like playhouses and film festivals as well as disney on ice and circuses and large concerts you buy your tickets and pay a dollar fee compared to what the traditional fees are from a ticket place that once again goes back to great value simplicity and convenience we know that  percent to  percent of the event ticket inventory goes unsold largely because of lack of awareness about the events in town or because the costs are too high we can utilize our kiosks to make people aware through the screens that an event is in town as well as utilize our  million email addresses to inform people on the redbox site this allows us to focus on a local perspective as well as drive great ticket sales for our partners in way that’s very efficient let’s say you are going up to a kiosk to get carrie underwood tickets you’re not sitting there holding up the line trying to pick your tickets you can get the four best available as a redbox customer you can go home and use your email to print your tickets or you can go to willcall and get your tickets for a dollar fee it doesn’t matter if it’s a  transaction it’s still just a dollar fee to you coinstar would earn a sales commission off of the tickets plus the dollar fee we don’t take the inventory risk and we get access to inventory we are also launching redbox instant with our partner verizon which is a subscription service that gives you a certain number of nights at the kiosks as well as the ability to stream unlimited movie content again it is extending the redbox brand in a way that makes sense as our partnership with verizon gives us access to content and technical background in order to bring our consumers who love newrelease content the ability to stream some of the older releases so we have six organic seeds that we run like a venture the gms have venture advisory boards that they report to which are made up of internal and external folks there’s a set budget that each of these folks is given and criteria they have to hit which line up with similar progressions that we did with the coinstar and redbox businesses if they’re not hitting those targets then money can get pulled away and put onto other ventures or their venture can get shut down in that regard it is the survival of the fittest which is how we want it in order to get products to market in a way that make sense and continues to extend out the brand our rubi coffee kiosks are the first to come out of the gate in  but it’s not the pump pots of coffee sitting on the counter at your grocery store you can get a great cup of freshly ground and brewed coffee for one dollar or lattestyle beverages for  and it’s a good location in front of grocery stores we’re partnering with seattle’s best which is a starbucks brand and you’ll see our rubi coffee kiosks out there next year meanwhile there are another five ventures behind that some won’t make it through the criteria that they need to meet but a couple will survive as we look to double the size of the company over the next five years we’ve talked about some innovative ideas here what role do you as cfo play in this strategic innovative decisionmaking process working with our ceo and the business leaders as a partnership really drives the overall strategic direction of the company the role that i have at coinstar is a broader one than your traditional cfo role at most companies because in addition to the traditional duties i also have the supply chain i have what we call our chief performance office which our employment teams our customer service teams and our lean teams report to  i also have the pr team as well as investor relations and internal communications it is a broader role and in working with our ceo and others it’s really about setting the overall core strategy of the business and how we’re going to double the business in five years and then double the business again after that in a practical way and that gets a great return for our shareholders it’s exciting to be part of the point of the spear that drives that strategy as we go forward what role does culture play in your success at coinstar we have a culture built around respect accountability and offering great products for our consumers and retail partners if you create the right atmosphere then the employees win your consumers win your partners win and your investors win because you will get great return as they become leaders in their spaces a lot of companies don’t nurture their ecosystem and eventually the ecosystem and the company gets sick we’ve really tried to figure out how we can continue to nurture the ecosystem in the places that we go while getting the right returns for our shareholders i think we’ve shown the health of our ecosystem in the coin business and redbox business where we have much better relationships with our studio partners than we did several years ago they now see the value of us in the supply chain in the channel and in the amount of dollars that come through our retail partners also see the great value of us increasing their foot traffic and increasing their profits with a very small footprint in their stores with our employees we continue to offer them great careers and the ability to move through the organization and perhaps go from the coin business to the redbox business or vice versa as we broaden those product offerings out it opens up a host of great opportunities for our employees to continue to evolve the other thing that we’ve done in the last couple of years is open an office focused around corporate social responsibility and sustainability and we were looking at sustainability issues even before that office was opened for example we have a remanufacturing plant in kent that can refurbish the coin and redbox machines and put them back out we would fill one of those big huge dumpsters with trash about once every week or two whereas now we fill one of those dumpsters once a year so we moved toward recycling but did that through a business lens then as we brought our sustainability team onboard we knew that consumers want you to be green but it has to have the return on it so at our kent manufacturing plant we showed that we could win from the business perspective from the sustainability perspective and from the consumer perspective i’m sure that while it is exciting to undergo such rapid growth it is also a challenge right yes because we have folks in different places the companys headquartered in bellevue washington while redbox is based in oakbrook terrace illinois so you have a large line of business that is  miles away we want them to have their corporate culture but also overlay the coinstar culture and setup new business ventures there’s three or so in the washington area three or so in oakbrook terrace while our strategic investments are in california so it is a challenge to stay focused on the culture we also have more than   field folks that are out servicing the kiosks and the redbox business filling the kiosks on a weekly basis and thinning them out not only do you have these two main areas of concentration of employees in washington and in the chicago area but you also have a whole host of people around the country that you have to work with you’re investing in other retail services like rubi coffee kiosks orango star studios ecoatm seeing that cfos spend more than half of their time on the strategic aspects of their companies what has been your role in planning and execution of expansions the ceo myself the general counsel and our head of new ventures are the primary members on an innovation council where we look at how all the ventures are doing as well as the new concepts that are out there so the ability to partner with teams to set the strategic direction of the company and determine the right levels of investment to make in that has been a lot of fun i’m also working with the ceo about setting the overall strategic direction on where we want to go with the company and how we’re going to play in the automated retail space when you say automated retail most people think of the selfservice at the airports or the grocery stores what we do is build relationships up through an automated retail solution now we’re looking at what does that really mean how does that fit in the overall selfservice market – which ihl estimates will grow to more than  trillion by  – and how does that fit into where these trends are going  so in  we’re looking to provide a much bigger vision of the company both internally because that gives us opportunities to grow for many years as well as externally because the redbox business is large fastgrowing and highprofile when it comes to the streaming aspect how do you see that offering stacking up against other players like netflix or comcast i think it’s a confusing space for consumers when you talk about streaming people think about videoondemand they think new releases subscription streaming or digitalization is not new release content it’s library content so when people say that competitors stream new release movies the fact is they don’t on a subscription basis it’s videoondemand you can buy them in an electronic version through est what we’re going to do with redbox is offer new release content at the kiosks packaged with unlimited streaming we call it movies that matter where we will be different is that the value proposition that we’re focused on is movies and the fact that you get instant gratification because you get new release content at the kiosks in your hands when you want them and you get great streaming content when you want that from a library perspective we have about  million email addresses today and we communicate with about onethird of those on a weekly basis telling them what’s in the kiosks what’s happening those kind of things we’re getting better at narrowing down the targets around that redbox instant business and we think there are a lot of opportunities to expand that business and drive it when we talk about doubling the business in five years roughly half of that growth will come from our redbox business and roughly half will come from our new venture businesses  so it’s a relatively substantial revenue number that needs to get hit and the big growth movers are going to be the core redbox business along with redbox instant and a few other things that we’ll test and work through over the next couple of years what role does emerging markets play in the doubling of revenue we’re starting to take a look at where we want to go from an international perspective we believe that a lot of the new ventures have great expansion opportunities internationally at a much lower saturation rate than what we did with coinstar coin counting kiosks and redbox already the coin business is in the uk ireland and canada while the redbox business is expanding into canada we’re looking at other opportunities for the redbox business internationally while there are good opportunities in other parts of the world for highvalue coin and coffee we don’t have a burgeoning international organization and we don’t necessarily count on the international market as we look at our fiveyear plan but we’re in the process of putting together that international strategy in a way that’s efficient and able to get us to the number we need before we conclude is there anything else you like to address it’s interesting as you look at how companies have evolved in this automated retail space and what that really means because it is a twoway dialogue with our consumers as i said we have about  million email addresses and we talk to onethird of those customers on a weekly basis we also have a larger facebook presence than some of the bigger companies out there and we have a club of people who are texted on a regular basis to get their promotion and those kinds of things so what we’ve been able to do is start with a kiosk and convert that into a relationship we want to establish a relationship with the consumer and build loyalty with them without overstepping the bounds coinstar has done a great job at being able to evolve that and as we move forward in these other businesses we want to have the same kind of connection the other thing the company has stayed focused on is building out our ecosystem and providing great profitability in a very small footprint for our retail partners and these new businesses coming up will bring new and different types of customers to our different partners and help us move into new channels we’ll be doing some exciting things in the next several years we’re evolving what coinstar means to both our consumers retailers and employees by trying to stay focused on the right things and making it a great place to work we think it will be a great experience for our consumers and will allow the whole ecosystem to be successful bios j scott di valerio j scott di valerio joined

austin thanks for having us newly in the ceo role came up from the cfo ranks  im wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about that transition and what its like now that youre steering the ship di valerio yeah its been a lot of fun ive been on the team for threeandahalf years so really working hard to set the strategy with our executive team and coming in as the ceo working with that team to continue to push forward the good thing is we have a good strong strategy thats leveraging our leadership in automated retail were focusing across six sectors that we set up that gives us about a  billion revenue sweet spot for us in the automated retail space in an  billion market were really setting course with our team to be able to get after that part of the business austin when you say  billion is that what you see as the addressable market for automated retail di valerio for automated retail yes then when we narrow it down to the six sectors that were looking at and the sweet spots that we think we can get after its around  billion with some adjacencies around it itll go out to around  billion so weve got a nice big market for us to get after and being a leader will allow us to get after it pretty quickly austin nice to have those good runways di valerio thats right austin you said you were looking at all these markets if you look five years out in all of your adjacent markets where do you see automated retail five years from today both from your perspective and from an industry perspective di valerio i think automated retail really plays into the trends that were seeing here  urbanization the  gratification that people want  as well as people getting very comfortable with technology and technology getting very good so that we can deliver products and services in a kiosk format or automated retail format i think people are getting much more used to getting products and services from an automated retail format i see it expanding out one of the things we do at coinstar and have done is we develop a relationship with our customers through the automated retail solution or the kisosk we do that through our email capture and being able to have communication back and forth with them through having a good customer experience to where people go to stores  certain stores and certain kiosks  because theyve developed a relationship with redbox or with coinstar were going to look to continue to do that with some of our other products as well as we bring it in the marketplace as we look out we see it continuing to expand we see it as being a way to sit in between that brickandmortar and the web fulfillment theres lots of opportunities for us in areas that we havent even addressed yet austin you said youre neatly positioned between bricksandmortar and that web experience those seem to be industries that have a lot of once great success stories here theres a lot of oncegreat retailers out there companies like sears or jc penney theres also a lot of oncegreat tech companies out there apple famously down microsofts not done a lot the past few years given that you guys are at the intersection of that what are you doing as an executive and as a company to continue the creative machine to make sure that you guys stay relevant and avoid the pitfalls that are inherent in both of those industries di valerio one of the things we always do is we start with the customer we do a lot of work trying to understand what customer trends are and what our customers want and what new customers that would be coming to us would want we start there and then start building backwards about how do we develop a solution if you look at our core businesses the coin business were rolling out our paypal solution where youre able to load up your paypal account with coins or cash or withdraw from your paypal account as well at our coinstar machines what that does is open up internet merchandising or merchandisers to maybe the underbanked and nonbanked customers there by being able to fill out your paypal again some adjacencies and extensions onto our business thats physical moving into the web world if you think about our redbox business we have our tickets business that were testing out we have reserve online so were always stepping out past what were doing from the physical presence as well we have a team thats really focused around new business ventures we have rubi  which you guys have tasted  the rubi machine our coffee business austin the reviews were good di valerio thats right good yeah we have crisp market which is prepared food in the breakfast and lunch daypart and we have star studio which is in the mall channel which is a whole new take on photo booth so green screens and music and fun really geared toward the teenager that goes to the mall  particularly the teen girls that go to the mall  and making it a fun experience for them we continue to stretch out around those kinds of businesses in order to be able to bring new customers to the coinstar brand but also to bring new products to our customers and continue to extend out that relationship that we have with them austin it sounds like a lot of new products i believe rubi is what a partnership with starbucks as well right seattles best is a starbucks label di valerio seattles best is a starbucks label we have an agreement with seattles best in certain channels to provide beans as well as to brand the machines we certainly are a very good partner with them but rubi is  owned by coinstar weve generated business its a partnership that we have with them in bean supply as well as obviously brand across key channels austin ok so it looks like we have rubi some sort of foodbased vending machines and some photobased vending machines if you were to pick a favorite child so to speak which one do you think has the most growth which one are you the most excited about going out a few years di valerio certainly our rubi machines the other businesses are relatively earlystage businesses its always hard to say ok which ones going to hit again crisp market is performing well in the couple of stores that theyre in today the couple offices that theyre in today star studio is in around  mall locations and doing quite well so we think that could be a nice business there we also have a business we call sample it which is beauty samples today think about paying a dollar at a cvs or a walgreens nasdaqwba for a couple samples of a cosmetic and a coupon not only do you for a dollar get to try out whether the product is going to work for you but then you get a coupon to be able to purchase it the machines we have in market there are performing well and the coupon redemption is quite high which the brands love as well as the retailers in fact walgreens just opened a brandnew banner store in downtown boston and the sample machine was built into the store there and again was a key focal point as they opened up the store austin sample it  it seems like youve got some friendships with walgreens i know you have a lot of kiosks with them what other brands are people sampling is it avon is it  di valerio yeah right now its geared on beauty we think it can extend to personal care and then on past that as well if you go into a sample it there will be a fragrance product from halle berry with the halle berry brand beyonce has branded products in there its across a number of the different traditional cosmetic brands theres face products there are fragrances there are lotions those kinds of things its again starting there small samples you can test out eye care products see if it works for you and then be able to go back and buy the regular size austin great i want to talk about the specter in the room of redbox obviously your cashcow business youve had a lot of success with it but a lot of the naysayers would say you guys are already at  market share and the dvd rental industry is an eroding space im wondering what is it about redbox and coinstar in general that is going to what would you say to the naysayers who are looking at this industry and saying well its eroding how are you guys going to maintain relevance di valerio certainly one of the key things with the redbox business is we continue to grow our market share and continue to increase overall rents by focusing on the customer and bringing a great new release product to the customer theres not a company that can deliver a new release product at the price point we do and i think our customers are rewarding us for that the first quarter of  we have  million unique credit card transactions which was up a million from the fourth quarter of  and up over  from the year before so were growing our customer base we rented nearly  million discs in the first quarter so were continuing to grow out that business that was an increase what were seeing the npd data shows that theres a slowing  the decline in the physical rental market  as the market has absorbed the demise of the brickandmortar stores where lots of rentals were going the national chains and have converted to redbox for the most part youre seeing revenues come down in the rental market but those revenues are coming down in large part because of the price point differential from when you went to brickandmortar you paid a higher price point than the  or  that you do at redbox austin ok im wondering if you could discuss the economics of your different kiosks maybe useful life the revenue generation that you see out of them if you could maybe across your big ones  coinstar redbox rubi di valerio you bet the redbox kiosk is a kiosk that costs us about  to manufacture and put into the market it pays back for itself in about  to  months it begins positive cash flow in about eight to  months so its a very nice machine they start off from a ramp perspective  in year one in revenue  in year two and  in year three so its a nice rampup business that returns on itself quite nicely and continues to go out from that perspective the useful life of the machines we have redbox machines that have been in market since the start we certainly bring machines in and refurbish them and do those types of things over time but theyre very stable very longlasting machines and have been built quite well from that perspective uptimes are extremely high on both the coin and the redbox machines in fact on the redbox machines about  of any issues we have with the machines are resolved remotely from our network operating center theres very few breakfix services that go out on the machines the same is true with the coinstar machine again very high uptime on those all the machines are connected wirelessly so we communicate with the machines routinely during the day we can fix issues on the machines routinely again its a quite nice business the coin machines are in the kiosk range austin thats cost to build di valerio cost to build they pay back in a little bit longer time than the redbox machine because its got fewer transactions going through but again weve had coin machines in the marketplace  years that weve been in the business weve had machines that are in the marketplace  years theyre very solid were always having to replace monitors and upgrades and do those kinds of things on a refurb basis but theyre very strong longlasting machines with high uptime austin great you guys it seems have retail relationships with everybody youve got safeway walmart cvs walgreens i think we talked about earlier im sure theyre all great partners but whats your favorite retail partner and why is there one that just provides really great entry points for you that you really enjoy working with or do you see a lot of use from your machines at certain locations di valerio it really depends on the business for the coin business what weve found is grocery and mass merch is the best way to go it has enough traffic and has a high enough traffic pace to where people come into the stores and utilize machines and those kinds of things the drug and convenience channel really dont work for the coin business we look at it from that perspective a new emerging market for us  channel for us i should say  for the coin business is the financial institution business we just put  kiosks in in td bank canada and are processing points for td bank and were looking to expand we have a few machines in the us today in the banking or financial institution channel and were looking to expand that out as we go out it really depends on business from a channel perspective when we look at redbox for example were in the grocery channel were in the mass merch channel were in convenience and were in drug but we have the machines located at different places for convenience and drug were primarily outdoors what that allows us to do is be open for  hours a day it allows customers to see the machine and it gets the right amount of traffic both for us and as well for our retailers and again it utilizes space thats very underutilized and turns it into very profitable space as well we really do focus based on the channel if i look at some of our new businesses like rubi the grocery channel will be a very good channel for us the mass merch channel will be a very good channel for us as well i think we really do try to take a look at it based on the channels as opposed to an individual retailer thats out there austin its the right channel the right placement and the right machine is really what dictates it di valerio exactly austin who would be the best retail partner that you dont already have who do you really want to become a partner with that you havent already tied the knot di valerio were very fortunate in the redbox business for example that we have the top  national grocery chains under our banners we have walmart which is the largest mass merch center as well as cvs and walgreens in the drug channel and eleven and circle k in convenience so we have very very strong channel space there with the coin business we have nine of the  grocery chains under the coin banner and walmart as well in the mass merch so we have very strong relationships as youve mentioned across there certainly there are a couple on the coin side theres one grocery chain that we dont have which we would love to bring up underneath the banner which is publix certainly we always are looking and talking to target as another large mass merch to see if there are some opportunities with them for some of our businesses on a general basis austin ok i wanted to talk a little bit about the progress of redbox instant and your partnership with verizon nysevz im wondering if you could maybe just elaborate on that any progress you guys have going there or what youre seeing as the early results di valerio you bet yeah were very pleased with our partnership with verizon to bring redbox instant to the marketplace we signed that deal in february of  and about  months later were able to launch a product through kind of a beta general availability were pleased with it so far one of the things weve been really doing is trying to understand from the customer is there enough content between the around  titles that you have on the streaming side as well as getting great new release content from the kiosk the surveys from our customers are saying yes theres enough content and theyre finding great newrelease content because you get four nights at the kiosk each month on the subscription as well as the streaming as we think about the business thats both from customers who have stayed on and are paid subscribers as well as ones who churned out of the business so were always trying to find the best mix there one of the great things about the redbox instant business is you basically have the full old brickandmortar store available to you if you think about it when you used to go to a brickandmortar store youd walk around the outside walls because thats where the newrelease content was weve taken that newrelease content and thats redbox basically weve taken those outside walls and put them into  square feet with redbox instant we now have the center of the store available to our customers we think its a great opportunity for our customers its a great value for our customers today at  for four standarddef rentals a month plus unlimited streaming or  for bluray for four nights at the kiosk were really pleased we think its a great value for our customers and as we roll into the third quarter redbox instant will do a lot more work around promoting the service as weve brought on more ce device manufacturers so that people are going to get that foot experience for being able to get it up on the tv in a much broader way austin now obviously theres a lot of incumbents in the streaming space we cant talk about this without saying netflix nasdaqnflx and amazon nasdaqamzn prime are they your biggest competitors here or am i misreading it do you think about it differently di valerio yeah i think our competitor is peoples time is what we look at what are people going to choose to do for their entertainment value certainly those folks are in that space across there plus a whole host of other people as well we think we are very well positioned because for customers who love movies youve got a service where you get newrelease content were the only service that can bring newrelease content and the physical aspect of it as well as the streaming in there what youre really doing is getting real newrelease content when you want it how you want it and then be able to get your stream from around that again were doing the business in a different way than some of the competitors on the streaming side we are paying for content on a persubscriber basis which means each subscriber we bring on for redbox instant is gross margin positive its different than a lot of our competitors are buying content up front and having to build up the subscriber base in order to be able to cover off the costs so they run negative a much longer time period than we will from a profitability standpoint because of the way that were structured and running the business we can be the no  or no  streaming business and still be very very successful both for us and for verizon austin its because of that margin dynamic di valerio the margin dynamic and the fact that were combining newrelease content at the kiosk on a physical basis along with the stream which is something that people are finding very compelling austin now the newrelease issue has definitely been a user negative leveled against netflix and verizon what is it about you guys that allows you to bring new releases to users i think a lot of people arent really familiar with the dynamic of why some of the streaming people have to wait and why youre able to get the newrelease content out there earlier in front of users di valerio theres a couple of ways to get newrelease content from the studios one is physical which certainly we do here at the kiosk and are really focused on that as a company the other way is through what they call paid video on demand  not the subscription video on demand  so to pay  to view a movie at home on your tv really we provide that same content at  for standard def and  for bluray people are continuing to buy bluray players at very high rates people love to get that physical disc and put it in because there isnt a better way from a bluray perspective to get really highdefinitionquality picture and sound the way you get it is through the disc you cant get that through a stream we feel very good about that we obviously are focused on it and we think that combination as you look at redbox instant combined with redbox on the physical side is a winning combination austin good combo there for users whats next in the pipeline for coinstar you guys obviously are rolling out a lot of new devices looking at new automated kiosks what else is there for users that they should be looking forward to over the next few years di valerio were going to continue to look and bring great automated retail solutions certainly with our coin line of business we are rolling out the paypal so thats a great opportunity for people to lever their paypal accounts and do some things they want to do there we also have a business in the coin business called gift card exchange where you can exchange your gift cards that youve been getting for years at stores that you might not go to or stores that you have a little bit of money left on those cards and get those turned in for cash we think thats going to be a very interesting business for us were starting to roll that business out theres around  kiosks in the market today and well expand that out over the next year to capture that and also be looking to do that with both your physical gift card but also your digital gift cards to be able to be the place where youre turning in your gift cards and then were remonetizing those out as i look at redbox for example were obviously beginning to roll out redbox instant in a broader fashion along with verizon were testing tickets out and were putting in some very good crm and loyalty programs that will roll out in the third and fourth quarters that will continue to extend out that redbox brand and value simplicity convenience and entertainment we are the no  place for people to watch newrelease content we want to be the no  place that people come to for overall entertainment if i look at the business broader we think there are some great opportunities to bring new products into the marketplace but also to extend them out both from a physical perspective as well as from an online perspective and keep marrying those two things up as we go forward austin great you guys have dramatically reduced shares outstanding in just a few quarters i think it was about  million shares im wondering now that youre ceo if you could discuss the logic and strategy behind that share repurchase program and whether or not you guys are interested in continuing it di valerio you bet we do capital allocation on a holistic basis you first take a look and say ok i need to invest in my core businesses to continue to grow them both from new innovations into the core businesses as well as the existing i need to invest in new businesses  like weve been talking about  to bring new concepts into the marketplace and then also in infrastructure in the corporation you calculate out what those returns are and also returning money to the shareholders through share buyback well continue to do that we balance those out to make sure that were doing it in a smart way but a way that really does drive the highest return four years ago our return on invested capital for example was in the low single digits last year we finished out at  austin congratulations di valerio its a nice focus for us to continue to do that and as we try to grow out this business  and weve talked about doubling the size of the company over the next five years  were going to do that while getting our return on invested capital up to  which isnt necessarily the easiest thing to do but thats how we stay in this very structured and balanced approach to getting returns for our shareholders austin got to aim high di valerio thats right austin what do you think is the single biggest thing that retail investors may be missing or should know about coinstar today di valerio its a business that really focuses on its customer and its a business that is very operationally sound and a business that continues to be inventive innovative and to bring new products to the market that customers want and do it in a way thats efficient and effective thats driving topline and bottomline growth if you look at our business weve grown doubledigits over the last four or five years both top line and bottom line and weve driven great free cash flow well over  million of free cash flow last year well generate between  million and  million of free cash flow this year its a business thats very strong very growthoriented but were growing profitability at the same time were growing revenue and free cash flows which is again a business that is very good to run its a business that should be very good to invest in and one thats probably a little bit misunderstood given the fact that we have a lot of great businesses and were in a business that we think is
