excellent quarter with both revenue and earnings well above the high end of our guidance we continue to deliver above market growth revenues of  billion exceeded the high end of our february guidance by  million and are up  on a core basis our adjusted eps of  is  above the high end of our guidance adjusted eps is up  over the second quarter of last year we delivered an adjusted operating margin of  up  basis points from a year ago this is our ninth quarter in a row of improving operating margins lets now take a closer look at the betterthanexpected q performance the story for the quarter are growth well above expectations in the chemical and energy pharma and european markets while our asia business remains strong the lead story was the strongerthanexpected pickup in the chemical and energy market with  core growth this comes on the heels of return to modest growth last quarter after  consecutive prior quarters of decline whats driving this higherthanexpected growth in our chemical and energy business while the exploration segment remains challenged the growth is broadbased across all geographies and product categories particularly gas chromatography spectroscopy and aftermarket services and consumables chemical and refining customers are increasing their capex purchases our customers in material and mining segments have also started reinvesting after a prolonged period of declining sales core growth in pharma  against a difficult compare also exceeded expectations demand continues across our pharma spectrum with highest growth in the biopharma segments and our nasd business we are seeing strong customer interest in our new offerings and across our portfolio our broad and differentiated opportunities in chromatography spectroscopy mass spectrometry services and chemistries well position us to capitalize on a strong pharma demand a few other end market comments our food business was up  against a difficult compare of  core growth last year food market fundamentals remained sound environmental and forensics were up  on the strength in the americas and europe as expected academia and government market funding conditions remained weak with our business down  for the quarter geographically europe exceeded our expectations with  core growth except for academia and government european growth was across all market segments with particular strength in the applied markets asia growth remains strong at  with china delivering high singledigit growth against last years growth of nearly  and in line with our expectations lets now turn to specifics for our business group the life sciences and applied markets group delivered core revenue growth of  growth was led by higherthanexpected strength in chemical energy pharma and environmental from a product perspective performance were broadbased across the portfolio with strength in chromatography mass spectrometry spectroscopy and cell analysis we continue to strengthen our instrumentation solutions portfolio in large we introduced the b triple quadrupole lcms system this new offering provides greater sensitivity and accuracy for applications such as food safety and environmental testing we also added to our portfolio of solutions in biopharma with the introduction of the agilent xt advancebio lcqtof ms system this system optimizes results for scientists seeking to characterize biomolecules that could be the basis for new therapies as we continue to see the external recognition of innovation and market leadership at pittcon  agilent won  prestigious scientist choice awards including best new separation product of  for the  infinity ii lc system and best webinar series of  for our series on solutions and biopharmaceutical discovery and development at the annual conference of china scientific instruments the gasoline intuvo  gas chromatograph system was selected as the green product of the year and the agilent b gcms system won for the most popular scientific instrument at this same china conference for the second year in a row agilent was recognized as the most influential foreign manufacturer our pipeline of new products are strong and were looking forward to the upcoming asms conference on their latest innovations from agilent the agilent crosslabs groups strong performance continues with core revenue growth of  well distributed across most regions and end markets our enterprise services and consumables growth was standout for the quarter finally the diagnostics and genomics group delivered core revenue growth of  while driving improvements in our operating margin growth was broadbased across pathology companion diagnostics with particularly strong growth through our nucleic acid cdmo business we continue to bring compelling new offerings to our customers we introduced a new target enrichment solution for nextgeneration dna sequencing agilent sureselect clinical research exome v this solution delivers more than  additional diseaserelevant targets compared to earlier version we introduced agilents first cgh assay for diagnostic use the genetisure dx postnatal assay this assay will enable to detect genetic anomalies earlier and more accurately than traditional methods in a significant win agilent was named the primary ihc and special stains vendor for quest diagnostics this is a testament to the advantage of our standing workflow solution as a reminder the integration of the former dako business under agilents systems was completed in q and were starting to see the bottom line benefits of more streamlined cost structure we are in the early phase of integrating the multiplicom acquisition into agilent and even more excited to have the agilent multiplicom team to be part of agilent coming off the strong start to  in the past  quarters how are we thinking about the coming quarters lets start with our lead story for the quarter the chemical and energy market we are pleased to see two consecutive quarters now of growth in the chemical and energy market however it is early and were not yet ready to call a cyclical recovery we do remain confident in our ability to capture market share in this market segment irrespective of market conditions we are the recognized leader in this space with an increasingly strong value proposition for our customers looking ahead at our other end markets with the exception of the academia and government markets we see solid market conditions for the pharma food environmental and clinical and diagnostics market specific to parma investment levels remained strong but we do expect some declining growth rates due to increasingly difficult compares and a few additional comments on academia and government we are expecting a continued weak funding environment across most geographies with the exception of china in the united states recent approval of the us federal budgets through september is an encouraging sign but weve not set  we have not yet seen funds being released geographically we expect the us and china to grow consistent with prior expectations while the growth trajectory in europe is uncertain the outlook for europe is highly dependent on the macroeconomic environment continuing to improve we do not expect european government and academia spending to improve and we are taking a waitandsee approach on the european chemical and energy market both major contributors to overall european performance these cautions aside we are excited about the companys growth prospects and the steps we are taking to position the company for future growth we are raising our full year core revenue growth and earnings expectations didier will share the details later in our call before i turn the call over to didier let me close with a few comments q  marked the year anniversary of this agilent leadership team being put in place and the full initiation of our companywide transformation initiatives over  years ago we outlined a path to increase shareholder value that was focused on outgrowing the market expanding operating margins on an organic basis and deploying capital in a balanced manner we have delivered on our shareholder commitments every quarter since then we have continue to outgrow the market and increase profitability each quarter often in challenging and economic circumstances we have improved operating margins by  basis points during this period with a companywide drive for continued profitability improvements during the same period we deployed our capital in a balanced manner with acquisitions and strategic investments of  million cash dividends of  million and share repurchase of  million behind these results are an energized agilent team with a relentless commitment to customers in our agilent dna is our teams ability to drive customerfocused innovation coupled with operational excellence it is this powerful combination that will continue to fuel our future growth and earnings expansion i look forward to answering your questions later in the call and will now hand off to didier didier will provide additional insights on our q results and updated guidance didier didier hirsch thank you mike and hello everyone as mike stated we delivered another strong performance this quarter  core revenue growth  basis points of operating margin expansion  eps growth and  million in operating cash flow even after contributing  million to our us pension plan the revenue performance drove most of the operating margin and eps performance during the quarter we bought back  million shares of agilent stock at an average price of  and paid  million in dividends i will now turn to the guidance for our third quarter we expect q revenues of  billion to  billion and eps of  to  at midpoint revenue will grow  on a core basis as mike stated at this stage we are not ready yet to call a cyclical recovery that assumes the sustainability of qs strong chemical and energy and european markets now to the guidance of fiscal year  we are raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance by  million including  million due to currency thus were increasing our core revenue growth guidance at midpoint from  to  were also raising the midpoint of our eps guidance by  including about  coming from fx there is no chance to operating cash flow guidance of  million and capex guidance of  million with that ill turn it over to alicia for the qa alicia rodriguez thank you didier karen will you please give the instructions for the qa questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of isaac ro with goldman sachs joel kaufman its actually joel in for isaac appreciate all the chemical and energy end market color you guys provided but just from a companyspecific perspective could you maybe quantify how much the intuvo  product cycle contributed to the organic growth this quarter michael mcmullen how about i make a few comments about our gas chromatography business and ill turn it over on to some specifics on the intuvo gc launch so in  we know the very strong performance in the chemical and energy as well as environmental market for the company in q and a contributor of that was the performance of our gas chromatography business high singledigit growth we saw in gas chromatography mainly through our  core product line as you know weve indicated in previous calls that intuvo will take some time to ramp and that we were expecting to be a more material impact on the companys pl as we went into the latter parts of this year into fy  so perhaps you can give a little color though patrick on how the intuvo launch has actually come along and how customers respond to the offering patrick kaltenbach okay yes thank you mike and so we are very happy with the launch we have seen exciting feedback from our first customers out there that said we are still in the ramp phase with the product we are still placing a lot of demo units out there the product is quite different into use  user interface et cetera in used model compared to our standard product of  we have put a lot of emphasis on usability easeofuse so customers really want to touch and see it first before they make a buying decision and as i said the feedback is very positive so far from the customers we have seen we are ramping the product it has not been a significant contributor to revenues this quarter yet but we are very confident that we have a real winning product in our hands here and it will make a more significant impact in the quarters to come so we are i would say bullish on the outlook but for this quarter it was not a very significant contributor yet joel kaufman very helpful and then in the context of the revenue and earnings upside weve seen throughout the first half of the year are there any rd programs or maybe channel investments that you guys are accelerating into the back half of the year michael mcmullen id say weve been really pretty much staying on our plan on record so  which as you know has been to invest at a higher level on the average in the industry and rd and i think ive been pretty transparent in some prior calls that we also were building a lot  adding a lot more a channel coverage and specialization particularly in such areas such as biopharma so i think were just tracking to the plan and as we said we were delighted by the q revenue results operator and our next question comes from the line of dan leonard with deutsche bank mike sarcone this is mike sarcone in for dan leonard so another question on the chemical and energy end market i think you mentioned that exploration remains challenged so does that mean you did see an improvement on the refining side in the energy segment and can you just elaborate on that and as well as the chemical performance michael mcmullen sure happy to so now just as a reminder for the audience when we look at our chemical and energy market segmentation historically about  of our business has been in exploration and id say that continues to be down very strongly so no signs of real life there at all the other  of the total is in the refining area and we have started to see some levels of reinvestment in the refining and then also in the chemical side which makes up the other  weve seen investments starting up there again inconclusive in the space we also report our sales into the mining and materials segments so id say the  of the segment shows signs of life though not yet ready to call a full cyclical recovery the other  in exploration remains down mike sarcone and if i could just pivot to biopharma it seemed like through the quarter end market performance diverged geographically for some of your peers or other tools players with exposure to the end market and by that i mean theres also some underperformance in north america did you see any of that in your biopharma business michael mcmullen no no not at all we saw a strong performance across all geographies and one of the things that  and no real notable difference in terms of relative to our expectations one thing i did try to note in the earnings call was the broadbased nature of our portfolio which allows us to really capture a lot of the demand there beyond say liquid chromatography or mass spectrometry operator and our next question comes from the line of tycho peterson with jpmorgan tycho peterson mike just trying to get our arms around the guidance here youre calling for  core in q against an easier comp after doing  this quarter is there something that would lead to maybe some extra conservatism in the quarter ahead michael mcmullen thanks tycho so ill leave the characterization to our guidance to you but what i can do share with you is this thinking i think there really are just  major watch areas for us and why were not  and it really is the chemical energy which as you know we put up a  growth after low single digits first quarter so wed like to see another quarter or  of that to see whether or not its sustained and then on europe europe was  growth for us which as you know coming this year we were quite concerned again we want to see if the economic environment continues to improve there but were just sort of taking a watch and see in both these areas as opposed to calling in type of sustained doubledigit growth in these areas what i would say is theres no hidden kind of concerns behind our guidance that we havent been already discussing tycho peterson okay and then for a followup on ddg obviously good quarter there we saw good standing numbers out of roche as well is there something going on in the end market in terms of improvement there and can you also talk on the operating margin increase that was certainly notable michael mcmullen im sitting right next to jacob here in the conference room i know hes delighted to talk about his doubledigit growth and his plus percent operating profit performance so how do i pass it over to you jacob jacob thaysen yes thanks mike and certainly we had a great quarter and youre also right that our portfolio business continues to provide momentum and youre also right that we see competitive  the competition also have good performance from our perspective we continue to see good momentum from both our omnis business so advance same portfolio but also including the pdl which continues to drive momentum i dont think we see a shift in the industry right now one quarter is not making the business we see more over a longer period of time but i dont think that we see that because  competitors have strong quarter that this is a change in the market environment but we continue to see overall pathology is a strong market to be in operator and our next question comes from the line of steve beuchaw from morgan stanley stephen beuchaw so ill actually start picking up on a point i think tycho was alluding to which is on margins didier could you just give us a sense for what the dropthrough looks like on incremental revenue in a quarter like this so we can think about how to fine tune our models best and then as a followup and its somewhat related mike you had some experience now of seeing the performance of the commercial team since you integrated the sales force and youve had a chance to take advantage of the breadth that you have in a refined service offering i mean how are you thinking about deploying those learnings as you see the results coming through putting the gas pedal down maybe a little bit more how does that make you think about the rate of opex growth for this business as you see the returns on these investments michael mcmullen yes and how about i start there didier you can go back to the margin question thanks for the question steve and didier and i have been talking a bit about the future modeling of the company and obviously well share more details with you later on in the year as we move into fy  but as you know weve been really working down our sga levels when we first started the company i mean we had a lot of restructuring and consolidation and we had a significant amount of cost savings we have been  and then what we tried to do from there was take the cost out and then invest based on the revenue growth so we would expect to see the sga grow lower than  and then revenue as we move forward weve done a lot of build outs in the lot of the channel i would tell you though there are some things we still like to continue to build out the academia and government for one is one of the area where were not yet at a leadership position so we do have some things on the drawing board where we like to have some additional incremental investments relative to todays level of resourcing but i think youll kind of see us stay with the same fundamental model of not cranking up these numbers as a percentage of revenue didier hirsch and on your other question steve the  so we continue having exceptional dropthrough operating margin incrementals weve enjoyed  for the whole year last year i think we had a  in q and this quarter we had  similar to what weve basically enjoyed in the last  quarters so excellent dropthrough obviously in part leading to the  core revenue growth michael mcmullen and i think its worth adding here didier which is how we manage the company right so listen were not going to shortchange investments which we think we can do relative to rd and channels for future growth but at the same point in time we are going to be disciplined with our spending and i think youll see thats how weve been managing the company and thats why weve been able to get some of these margins up for the overall company performance stephen beuchaw i appreciate all the color there just one detail point for me and then ill let others jump in it has to do with the expansion of the plant in colorado the oligonucleotide capacity expansion i wonder if we could get an update there on how that process is going and how we might think about the timing on when that incremental capacity could be a driver contribution at the topline michael mcmullen yes its actually a very timely question because didier and i just review with jacob and the team the progress on the construction and if you happen to find yourself on frederick county we can give you the address you can drive by and wave to the construction crew there but construction is proceeding as planned right on target and we got through the winter months without a lot of any kind of major disruptions to our construction and from a  as you know this is a pretty complex manufacturing facility in fact this will be sort of a oneofakind in the industry given the amount of capacity that were adding and then it also requires a level of validation required on the site so long story short of it i think you should think about this as being an fy  revenue impact for the company we do believe that we can continue to get strong growth in our current facility but as you know were going to run out of capacity so were looking to bring that online in early fy  operator and our next question comes from line of brandon couillard from jefferies samuel couillard mike a question for you i mean with  of the chemical and energy business trending positively i mean what do you want to see before feeling more comfortable calling a bottom there and any chance you could give us an update on whats embedded in your full year outlook for core growth for that segment michael mcmullen sure so part of it is tied to the macro view of a cyclical industrial recovery and i dont think id add comments to there yet as well so itd be nice to have some external validation and then from an agilent perspective i like to see another quarter or  my first year in the job i can remember getting a little overly enthusiastic about a turn in the chemical and energy and i was only off by  or  quarters when we first started seeing growth again so having sort of learned my lesson im a little bit more cautious about when to call the downturn  i mean the upturn excuse me listen well take the business but i think ill need another quarter or  and then give me a little bit of the external validation from some of the economists and i think were looking at alicia for didier hirsch  michael mcmullen about  right about  for the year samuel couillard okay super and then one more part question though you hired a new svp of strategy and corporate development in march i believe anything to comment there in terms of your nearterm ma appetite and then one for didier it looks like you took buybacks out of the second half of the year any signal or messaging youre trying to share with us there michael mcmullen yes so first of all brandon thanks a lot for the close watching of the company and were delighted to have sam raha on the agilent executive team sam is actually here in the conference room with us as well and in terms of the ma appetite i think youre seeing that we are quite interested in adding new capabilities to the company in fastgrowing spaces and weve done  ma deals already one was a strategic investment in lasergen we feel a lot of interesting assets out there particularly in the private space and given sams experience in analyzing industry we think this allow us to perhaps have an increased level of velocity working through targets so i think our appetite remains the same but what were doing is bringing on additional strong capability to help us through that process and then ill pass this over to you didier didier hirsch yes brandon on the buyback you have a good eye we have a very disciplined approach to our buyback program once a year in november we register a b and the approach is both formulaic and opportunistic which means that we are able to flex our buybacks according obviously to market conditions and the one thing that i would also mention is that this is not a program where you dont use it you lose it any amount that is below what we plan to spend in a quarter is carried over to the next quarter and on and on if needs be so with that  last  we felt it was more cautious with the valuations of the market that we do not forecast the buyback because there is a cap there is no doubt the cap was raised  last time we raised  in november and we will certainly raise it again as we register the next buyback in a few months time but we dont know what we dont know and based on the potential market valuations in that we decided that for the second half it was better not to assume any buyback and obviously we dont  we will see what happens operator and our next question comes from the line of doug schenkel with cowen and company douglas schenkel my first question is on china just some cleanup there what was growth in the quarter anything interesting to call out by end market and did the timing of lunar new year play any role it and strength in the quarter in china michael mcmullen great always happy to share some insights on the  on china in terms of our overall growth high single digits for the quarter i think the most thing  most important thing to note is the compare against the  almost a  growth rate on the prior year the end market demand continues to be quite healthy there and were still on our view that this can be  this will be a low doubledigit growth country for us in  so no change at all in terms of the fundamentals which remains strong and to your point about lunar new year really no impact so its nice not to be talking about that in an earnings call as a reason for difference in performance so things are really looking good in china the market fundamentals are intact there and were really quite pleased with the performance of the company and were right on our earlier start of the year expectations of growth for china douglas schenkel okay and not to beat a dead horse here but i just want to push you a bit more on guidance what  youre guiding the third quarter as its been noted to a moderation against the most favorable comps of the year and then when you look ahead to q your guidance implies the lowest growth rates since i think the first half of  i mean that just doesnt make a ton of sense based on what were hearing from you across the board either something isnt going as well as it seems which sure doesnt seem to be the case or it seems like at this point after  quarters of guiding the levels that are well below what you actually put up that if were going to be kind of intellectually honest about whats going on with the business that we should be modeling something a lot higher than what youre guiding to so with all that in mind i just want to make sure they were  there was nothing in terms of the cadence in the quarter or any timing dynamics that came into play that shaped how youre guiding with the second half of the year michael mcmullen so let me make two comments here then didier feel free to add anything to that but first of all relative to anything that  i forget exactly the terminology is but anything that could be negative or significantly going wrong with the business thats by no means the case here so the fundamentals of this company are very sound as well as the end markets the point i perhaps will belabor if you dont mind is with my experience holding a turn  years ago in the chemical and energy market i called it too early and it never happened in fact we drove along for  or  quarters we also know that the european market particularly in the summer months is not always the strongest so those are two things that we were watching and thats the reason why weve guided the way we want  weve done for the second half by the way i think our core growth guidance guide for the year is i think perhaps at the upper end or higher than any of our peers so were already moving out our core growth rate for the year higher than everybody else in our space but based on our product experience in watching europe and calling for a turn a sustained turn in the chemical energy i was wrong before so i want to make sure i got it right this time so well give it a few more quarters didier anything else youd add to that didier hirsch well maybe two things number one on chemical and energy basically our revenue this quarter was a lot based on the yearend budget flush that  in terms of orders that we saw among our customers and perhaps the beginning of the year so we dont know how to really read it and if it is sustainable or not for that reason its very much related to the end of last years budget and beginning of this years budget and they might not be totally relevant data points well see and maybe the other thing is that a testament to the great work that our teams have done in terms of converting orders into revenue i mean weve done a fantastic job the patent order and also  of orders also has improved tremendously with a lot more orders coming into the first month of the quarter all that has a positive impact also this quarter among many many other things obviously what was more important is the great order performance and we dont  we are not able to operate with a smaller backlog than we used to back  years ago before we put in place this tremendous operational improvements in our managing of the orders and so there we have bit less visibility potentially than we used to  years ago but it was not very good visibility now its better in some way operator and our next question comes from the line of ross muken from evercore isi luke sergott its luke in for ross so i guess if  were talking a lot about the intuvo and your new product pipeline i guess can you break out how much of this quarters growth was due to the new product pipeline and i guess more importantly how has this  how is your product pipeline that exists now how does that compare to say   years ago before mike took over the helm michael mcmullen so ill take that last one as well so in terms of the contribution to this quarters revenue from new products we dont actually go through any of those internal calculations but id have to say its been a significant contributor to the growth so as you know  and this is a phenomenon that has been growing for several quarters right because for the last  years we bring into the market a number of products were talking about the intuvo right now but we have the whole infinity two series a bunch of new spectrometry products so weve been coming to market jacobs team has been inducing a new genomics offering so i have to say our business model is based on the ability to get to market new solutions that are differentiated and really do make a difference for our customers thats our business model and i think thats whats been part of the reason combined with our extended channel which weve been able to grow the way weve been growing and  but it may seem like not the most objective view of our performance in fact coming in as i put myself in the back a bit i think our pipelines are much improved one  and if you recall from our earlier discussions my first indiscernible in this role i described for you a massive restructuring of our rd teams and how we set up our business units and how we put more of our instrumentation for example all under patrick and we consolidate from  different aspect divisions into one i think now youre starting to see those  the impact of those because we now have our monies allocated on the biggest bet and i think were able to get to decisions more quickly and were able to get to market more quickly so i believe that our product lines  i mean our pipelines are most robust theyve ever been and i would say to all of you on the call is were not done yet so we have a lot of great ideas very strong team and i think our  but our pipeline and portfolio has never been in better shape luke sergott great and i guess turning to the gross margins theyre really strong in the quarter can you just dig in a little bit more there like what was leading that strength in the business indiscernible going forward michael mcmullen yes ill make some highlevel comments and i think  then ill pass it on to didier so obviously topline growth at  core growth helps a lot but we also have a number of initiatives underway in order fulfillment team our global manufacturing footprint under henrik and were getting a lot of cost out of our materials optimizing overhead costs as well as driving down logistics but anything else youd add its probably a mix impact there i think as well didier hirsch nothing to add obviously i chose   years ago you started as a  in the controllership organization mike michael mcmullen yes yes didier hirsch nothing to add operator and our next question comes from the line of derik de bruin from bank of america merrill lynch derik de bruin i guess i got a couple of short ones since a lot of what ive wanted to know was asked can you just break out the instrument versus consumable organic growth for the quarter michael mcmullen well i guess youre probably referring to the analytical side of the house i think the best way to look at that is just go to the performance of the lsag and acg groups so i believe patrick was up  and  on a core basis and mark and the crosslab group was double digit at  derik de bruin great just on the  you called out this winning this order in quest for staining can you give us an idea sort of the magnitude on how that sort of works in the numbers going forward michael mcmullen yes so we were pretty excited by this as you imagine its a pretty significant win i think it really is a testament to what we believe is a  it is an excellent product that the omnis autostainer was introduced its a real validation of how strong that product offering is but jacob perhaps you want to add a few comments in terms of the deal parameters at least perhaps described for derik how the rollout looks the multiyear deal jacob thaysen yes thanks and as you can imagine we are quite happy with  that we won this account and as you know quest is one of the biggest reference laboratories in the us so this is a substantial deal for us i cannot go into the actual numbers but we are looking at a multiple site rollout over the next  to  months where we will install on this in all of the quest sites here in the us and we look at many many on this and many many hundred thousands of slides test that will be run on those instruments within a year time frame derik de bruin and sort of a followup i remember when you bought dako back in  the business was sort of underperforming and sort of lagging peers can you sort of talk about where we are sort of with dako these days and i guess how are  are you sort of going back at the market or the consumable is sort of back where its going i mean is that tracking on where you thought it would be jacob thaysen yes i mean so ive been part of that journey for quite a while now and im very pleased where we are today omnis is definitely a driver of that and then we played instrument to drive consumables so what is we  the key indicator for us internally is how our consumables our test volume is increasing and we can see a very very strong momentum in the test volume not only from our pd l but also from our broad portfolio of assays so i see both strong win over of new accounts and also current accounts driving more and more slides out there so i will say that we have turned that business around and theres still a lot we can do but i feel like were now working on an market growth level and theres more and more to do and much more to come operator and our next question comes from line of puneet souda from leerink partners puneet souda so just if i could touch briefly on just the gcm a couple of other questions have already been answered so maybe if i could ask on the  overall in the lcms business seems like that continues to grow could you maybe give us a sense of  if youre taking share with qtof and appreciate the comments in qtof and triple quads there are you taking share in that market with qtof versus the highresolution competitors in the market or is it more of the biomolecules growth that you continue to see in that market thats propelling the numbers forward michael mcmullen first of all thank you very much for the congratulatory comments and i think ill pass it over to patrick and give you  share some more insights in terms of whats going on with lcms patrick kaltenbach yes thank you mike and youre right puneet its not only the triple quad market thats strong when you look at the opportunity in qtof its playing in the biomolecule market as mike said we just launched a new bio qtof that drives healthy growth on the biopharma and with that along  and along that also weve put the qtof itself we also deploy as you know the qtof in applied markets like environmental when you do pesticide screening and environmental fluid et cetera we have very differentiated solutions from our side so i think that we have a great opportunity with this platform we dont disclose market shares and market share gains but i would say with what we have launched and also what were launching at the upcoming asms we are looking very much forward to continue growth in the lcms market puneet souda okay got that just a brief one if i could on the expectations for the pharmdx pdl test that you have in place there are competitors that have been entering that market with our label expansion so has that changed your opportunity overall in that market whats your thoughts there michael mcmullen you want to take that jacob jacob thaysen yes i can take that also and youre absolutely right that we see competitors entering to the market that is not unexpected once you get in a cdx business and when you are departments with a pharma company that you enter and you get a first move advantage meaning that many accounts have already implemented our test and trained the pathologies in reading out as a slide so even as a new competitor coming in there that is of course increased competition but we believe we are in a very strong position to continue with our leadership position operator and our next question comes from the line of jack meehan from barclays jack meehan i wanted to follow up on the back of the intuvo launch do you think youre seeing more pull through across selling opportunities across the rest of the portfolio maybe any intangible signs at crosslab or elsewhere michael mcmullen yes absolutely so weve been calling this the inside to cover the halo effect so as you may know in this space gas chromatography is often viewed as a very mature technology so customers arent anxious to have a sales rep come out and talk about the gas chromatography different story when youre  youve got a product like intuvo which is its so different and customers now recognize that theres really something special here with this offering so what were finding is that our account manager was able to go out and get appointments meet with a customer and then that allows us to have a broader discussion around the productivity improvements and enhancements on for example our  or we can talk about our enterprise services and consumables you may have noted  and ill ask mark to chime in on this since hes been the  probably quiet on call so far on the consumables and services side but what weve seen is we get into a different conversation with a customer and thats why you noticed in my earnings call script i talked a lot about the broadbased growth in chemical and energy i think this intuvo gc has been great to help us get into a different set of conversations with customers and mark i dont know if youd add anything on what youre seeing on the consumables and services side because you had doubledigit growth in that space as well mark doak well i have just a couple of things mike and weve talked before about how weve seen the market over the last couple of years as customers continued to use their assets improve the performance of the asset itself keep their  obviously their operations going and when we see the tailwind if you will from now more purchase in the marketplace its really more just a surge of new installation that provides some additional revenues in the space so overall though the differentiation in the market it comes back to some work were doing and inside of our chemistries division around new technologies associated with the intuvo also advancing some of the chemistries weve done in very traditional space in gc columns and seeing some nice market gains there so all in all its just  its been proved to be a case where customers continue to buy based on keeping it going but also on top of that look towards the additional revenues from the expansion in the energy space michael mcmullen yes thanks mark and just to kind of close it off jack which i think what were able to do is actually go out and talk about the whole portfolio with the customer including some of the new capabilities and marketing thats brought on board as well jack meehan thats great and then i have the followup on the margins and dgg i think its the best ever on record that we have at least our model has maybe could you just talk about the scalability of the business as you see it now and was there anything onetime in the quarter just you called out the quest win again just any other color michael mcmullen i mentioned earlier were  the management team is in the conference together taking this call and theres a big smile on jacobs face that somebody noticed and hes well on his task to hitting that  hes driving for  this year obviously the strong revenue performance helped a lot in terms of the operating margin but perhaps you want to build on that jacob thaysen yes youre absolutely right that we  the topline drives our bottom line also so the margin really has driven the  margin operating margin we have up  basis points is certainly something im very pleased with what i want to remind also is that if you look into q we come from a lower margin perspective there so the  quarters the first half of the year here is really around the  where i believe we have committed to delivering on this business for the full year so we are still on that track and thats what were aiming for michael mcmullen maybe ill just add to that i mentioned it in my call script but the early part of this year marked a major milestone for us which was the integration of the former dako business into the agilent infrastructure and systems and i think that is part of your story i mean that was always part of the plant but thats also why we think that some of these improvements all being lets say a  operating margin every quarter but thats also why i believe some of these improvements are sustainable because we are fundamentally changing the underlying cost structure that support this business operator and our next question comes from the line of dan arias from citigroup daniel arias mike again it doesnt look like were getting together  mike it doesnt look like were getting together for analyst day this spring so maybe just one on strategy wondering if you can offer anything on how interested you are in ma at this point and to the extent that youre looking around at assets what might you be willing to deploy and then where might the focus be michael mcmullen yes i think first of all you correctly noted were not holding an analyst day this year its not to say that we wont do it again but we felt like the first year was important for the management team to come out and tell the new story i thought it was important a year later to tell you how its going and then a lot of the coaching and obviously indiscernible hey mike we really prefer you to have you spend a lot of time just run the business and focus on customers so thats our plan but well probably back out at some point in time with analyst day as we move into  relative to ma i would just leave it as i think what the communication weve had for the prior quarters remain the same which is we like assets that are in parts of the marketplace which we see inherently growing faster whether it be the acquisition we made of seahorse bioscience and i hope you notice that we called out cell analysis as a driver for growth in our lsag business we acquired most recently multiplicom which is in a fastergrowing molecular diagnostics space so we like assets that  where the end markets are growing faster than perhaps the corporate average were bringing a new capability to the company and we love theyre accretive short term and what we realized is that a lot of the deals actually is going to incur we believe in the private space and we have a pretty active funnel we like the bolton acquisitions we will do every once in a while technology deal like we did with lasergen we see something thats not out there we dont have but in general we want companies with existing customers and revenue that will make a nice run to the companys portfolio daniel arias got it okay thats helpful and then didier on the margin outlook when you guys brought the  op margin target in for the year its still kind of sell i think that was a number that you thought you were capable of doing if things went well so i guess just given the top line momentum and the progress in terms of the operational stuff is it right to think about that now i mean do you see upside of the  midpoint for the year just given the trajectory didier hirsch yes we had  i had explained back in november the reasons why we had reduced kind of the guidance from  to  it was related to  factors but i also pointed out that internally we set our performance metric  internal performance metric be at risk at the same  that we had long talked about so we do feel that there is a  we have a shot at it and we were willing to basically put our be at risk there and since then we have had some good momentum and  but we are absolutely  its not yet ready to obviously declare the victory there michael mcmullen that was interesting i think but reflecting back at our first analyst day we put out year goals of  core growth and  operating profits were at the  core growth and were hoping to find a way to get to  and as didier mentioned thats a standard where were holding ourselves to inside of the company operator and our next question comes from the line of sara silverman with wells fargo sara silverman i just have a quick one on your free cash flow guidance it looks like you guys left that unchanged and given the guidance raise on revenues quarter do you think that may go up could you talk about why theres really anything not unchanged and whats going on with the cash flow didier hirsch yes its a fair question obviously the operating profit is only one of the manufacturers that we look at in the operating cash flow or free cash flow similar to i guess the answer to the previous question we do see a path for a higher operating cash flow than what we have guided at but were not yet ready to commit to it operator and our next question comes from the line of paul knight with janney william march this is actually bill on for paul just one question for you guys crosslabs for the past  to  quarters has been growing high single digit organically can you maybe just talk about how much of that is coming from customers looking to outsource or services for new products and maybe some  what are some opportunities to maybe continue to grow that and then are you seeing some gains in market share as well michael mcmullen yes so thanks for the question im going to make a few initial reminder comments of how we set up the company and im going to pass it over to mark for some specifics but ive been going back to this trip down memory lane a bit if you will and  years ago when we set up the company we formed crosslab group it really did change our view of the addressable market for the company we said not only do we want the agilent install base but we should view the whole lab ecosystem as the opportunity for agilent to provide value to our customers and we also thought theres some  starting see some fundamental changes in terms of demand that therell be some outsourcing from companies such as big pharma that were looking for new  for somebody to take on some of their internal activities and i think thats happened it is happening so mark why dont you kind of build on the story and also talk about how were doing relative to our wins in the market mark doak thanks mike and thanks for the question ill try to be as specific as i can you asked the question about how much of this is based on outsourcing its difficult to say but i think if you look at the trends in pharma and even some of the recent studies down there theres an increasing work to outsourcing as i go for with the area for optimization i dont think its accelerated necessarily but its still out there i would say in our case weve had a broad focus on the lab operations side and bringing all our components together as complete solutions and i think thats whats really driving a lot of our growth is how were coming together as more of a partner and consulting on how to get the most out of those lab operations and competitively looking at this is at a growing market are we gaining share the answer i think simply is both and  or executing well on the ground in terms of our sales teams across the globe were also seeing just our increasing portfolio that goes towards this multivendor area hopefully that helps william march that does and mike maybe just one quick one on capital allocation as you think about share buybacks dividends and with  net cash how do you think about whats the optimal strategy for agilent in terms of leverage or lack thereof michael mcmullen well we think that weve been describing it as a balanced capital allocation policy where our primary use of cash is to invest in the business we talked about ma a bit already today but also the investment in our new facility in colorado so were going to use our cash for  primarily for investing in the business but we also want to increasingly grow our cash dividends so you see every year weve been bringing up our cash dividend and were also using our leverage capability to actually buy back shares so the share repurchase program that was announced when i came in as ceo actually was financed through debt so  and we like to keep some  our debt capacity available for ma as we would see and were quite conscious of maintaining the investment grade level rating on our debt so i guess long  or short of it is no change from the strategy weve been pursuing for the last  years operator and our next question comes from line of catherine schulte from robert w baird catherine schulte within pharma youve talked about small molecule customers going to a replacement cycle any updated thoughts on how much longer that has left and then can you break out what you saw from small molecule versus biopharma in the quarter michael mcmullen yes so i think patrick your opinions i wont go into a baseball analogy but i think were  i wont ask you for the innings but i think weve always believed weve had at least another  months or so of higher demand by the way theres always a replacement cycle going on we have just been in the accelerated one going on in pharma as it relates to chromatography we think that we may be seeing the earlier signs of that same thing happening in gas chromatography but well still wait and see on the sidelines for that relative to the  to mix between small and large molecule i think its fair to say that the  both have been growing quite strongly but the growth in biopharma is at a higher rate than the small molecule albeit a smaller part of our mix historically weve been about  i guess between small molecule and large molecule patrick kaltenbach about  michael mcmullen about  sorry yes  and were putting a lot of investment and focus on the biopharma space so we talked a lot in my call about some of the new solutions and its also been a major area of emphasis in terms of investment in our channel as well catherine schulte okay and then looking at the economic end market can you quantify what growth was across the different geographies and remind us of your exposure by geography in that end market michael mcmullen so while didier is looking for his notes ill just say this is the one part of the end market where the pitcher has continued to be quite challenged the funding level share globally with perhaps the exception of china have been fairly weak but why dont you provide some of the breakout didier hirsch no ill just say it was throughout the world we saw yearoveryear kind of a reduction with the exception mostly of us  japan but on the small base and that surprised us and there is not much we can wriggle of that because its on the small base and parts of  other parts of asia pacific but the big markets americas and europe were weak michael mcmullen yes and my comments kind of specifically  specific to the outlook not the quarters numbers right right didier hirsch yes operator and that concludes our questionandanswer session for today i would like to turn the floor back over to alicia rodriguez for any closing comments alicia rodriguez all right thank you karen and on behalf of the management team id like to thank everybody for joining us on the call today if you have any questions feel free to give us a call on investor relations and
