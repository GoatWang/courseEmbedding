type has different features risks and rewards money market funds have relatively low risks by law they can invest only in certain highquality shortterm investments issued by us corporations and federal state and local governments bond funds have higher risks than money market funds because they typically aim to produce higher returns because there are many different types of bonds the risks and rewards of bond funds can vary dramatically stock funds invest in corporate stocks not all stock funds are the same some examples are growth funds focus on stocks that may not pay a regular dividend but have potential for aboveaverage financial gains income funds invest in stocks that pay regular dividends index funds track a particular market index such as the standard  poor’s  index sector funds specialize in a particular industry segment target date funds hold a mix of stocks bonds and other investments over time the mix gradually shifts according to the fund’s strategy target date funds sometimes known as lifecycle funds are designed for individuals with particular retirement dates in mind what are the benefits and risks of mutual funds mutual funds offer professional investment management and potential diversification they also offer three ways to earn money dividend payments a fund may earn income from dividends on stock or interest on bonds the fund then pays the shareholders nearly all the income less expenses capital gains distributions the price of the securities in a fund may increase when a fund sells a security that has increased in price the fund has a capital gain at the end of the year the fund distributes these capital gains minus any capital losses to investors increased nav if the market value of a fund’s portfolio increases after deducting expenses then the value of the fund and its shares increases the higher nav reflects the higher value of your investment all funds carry some level of risk with mutual funds you may lose some or all of the money you invest because the securities held by a fund can go down in value dividends or interest payments may also change as market conditions change a fund’s past performance is not as important as you might think because past performance does not predict future returns but past performance can tell you how volatile or stable a fund has been over a period of time the more volatile the fund the higher the investment risk how to buy and sell mutual funds investors buy mutual fund shares from the fund itself or through a broker for the fund rather than from other
