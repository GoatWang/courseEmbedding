management platform for commercial facilities verdigris technology combines proprietary hardware ai and software applications to deliver insights about building operations in  fast company named verdigris one of the world’s  most innovative companies in energy based on the concepts of nonintrusive load monitoring the verdigris energy platform monitors every electrical device in a building by means of monitoring the electrical feeds coming off of the buildings circuit panel verdigris claims to provide data actionable insights and automation to help commercial facilities managers increasing the energy efficiency of their buildings areas that verdigris works to impact include reducing power usage during peak hours identifying motor problems that could be using excess energy and detecting equipment faults before they occur verdigris’ customers include major hotels corporate offices hospitals and manufacturers early customers included the city of san jose autodesk and netflix today verdigris has over  systems deployed in the us and around the world including customers in the united kingdom egypt brazil and china notable current customers include jabil circuit vention medical the

external links product versionsedit the most recent th generation version of the verdigris energy platform einstein was formally launched on august   with a live demo at the jabil blue sky center in san jose california according to engineeringcom “verdigris claims that einstein differs from their previous hardware because it is more straightforward to install and it has an integrated cellular radio previous equipment from the company required an attachment to an external data connectivity system” servicesedit “we provide analytics and workflow automation to  facilities teams to improve operational efficiency reduce equipment downtimes and save on energy delivered as a saas” said cofounder thomas chung to techcrunch in march  verdigris smart sensors clamp onto electrical circuits to track a building’s energy consumption and sends the data securely over wifi or verizon glte to the cloud verdigris claims that its patented sensors track energy through an alwayson ai that consumes more detailed information than any other solution its sensors take hundreds of millions more data points than a utility smart meters—every hour this enables verdigris ai technology and algorithms to “learn” a building’s equipment over time it tracks energy output down to the microsecond and has equipmentlevel data verdigris claims its sensors take hundreds of millions more data points per hour than a utility smart meter verdigris uses smart sensors that attach to a building’s electrical panel wiring this allows verdigris artificial technology and algorithms to “learn” about a building verdigris has three analytics products web dashboard to provide insights on a buildings energy consumption tracker a configurable mobile app to send alerts lobby dashboard a visual presentation of the building’s energy use that can be displayed on a screen in a building’s lobby verdigris forecasting for demand management uses a deep learning recurrent neural network model it reads a buildings energy usage in real time and combined with weather or building occupancy produces a probability distribution for estimated power consumption kw the verdigris system is certified for use in  countries including the united states the european union  countries china malaysia mexico india canada company historyedit verdigris cofounder and ceo mark chung came up with the idea for verdigris when he returned home from vacation to a massive electricity bill the local utility could not provide chung with an itemized utility bill to show where he spent the extra electricity chung bought inexpensive kilowatt meters hacked them to be wifi enabled and built an electrical map to monitor every appliance in his house he found the problem a broken pool pump and thought of a business idea to map commercial buildings that use a lot of energy verdigris participated in the stanford accelerator startx and as one of the startx notable companies was invested in by stanford university verdigris was also one of the  inaugural winners of the founderorg competition and invested in by founderorg capital nasa was also an early backer of verdigris and the two organizations have collaborated on

figuring out what’s not working why and repairing the problem unexpected scheduling – someone on staff changes the bms schedule incorrectly undiagnosed issues – you learn about problems in your building from occupants not your staff today’s process is labor intensive daily walkthroughs to check equipment and preventative maintenance schedules to guess when something might break today’s
