its ability to continue as a going concern with management estimating it needs more than  million in revenue by the end of march to stay afloat flandreau santee sioux president anthony reider told the associated press that tribal officials knew of monarch’s financial challenges but chose it because the company was willing to sign a shortterm deal and sought a smaller share of profits than other consulting firms “obviously it raised a red flag” reider said of the sec filings “but … there are so many people in the industry that would be able to step in and help in the event that they were to close” monarch ceo eric hagen said in an interview that efforts to raise the revenue are going “very well” but wouldn’t elaborate he downplayed monarch’s financial challenges saying the company is “in a good position currently” the tribe already operates a casino and other businesses on its land and sees marijuana as a way to bring in more money to develop housing and other projects it’s estimating
