capital management  norman fields gottscho  new york we believe the key to investment performance is what a company will sell next year and going forward and whether the business will earn money from those sales we build a close relationship with our clients and their families to understand their investment objectives our goal is to manage clients� wealth so that it truly serves their lives for generations to come there are two times in a man�s life when he should not speculate � when he can�t afford it and when he can the best performance is produced by a person not a committee the big money is not in the buying and selling but in the waiting i skate to where the puck is going not to where it has been there is nothing sinister in so arranging one�s affairs as to keep taxes as low as possible rule no  never lose money rule no  never forget rule no  i never buy at the bottom and i always sell too soon in my whole life i have known no wise people � who didn�t read all the time � none zero you don�t need to know a man�s weight to know that he�s fat i write in order to understand as much as to be understood never invest in any idea you can�t illustrate with a crayon i can calculate the movement of stars but not the madness of men everyone has a plan �till they get punched in the face nurture your flowers and cut your weeds nothing is a waste of time if you use the experience wisely view a stock as an ownership of the business and judge the staying quality of the business in terms of its competitive advantage it is impossible to produce a superior performance unless you do something different from the majority read  pages every day that�s how knowledge works it builds up like compound interest all of you can do it but i guarantee not many of you will few people think more than two or three times a year i have made an international reputation for myself by thinking once or twice a week investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike common sense is not so common the greatest lesson in life is to know that even fools are right sometimes through the vicissitudes of wars panics and depressions investment in america�s growth and development has never proven a mistake out of clutter find simplicity from discord find harmony in the middle of difficulty lies opportunity if you dont have time to do it right when will you have time to do it over every age has its peculiar folly some scheme project or fantasy which it plunges spurred on by the love of gain the necessity of excitement or the mere force of imitation most of the time common stocks are subject to irrational and excessive price fluctuation in both directions as a consequence of the ingrained tendency of most people to speculate or gamble�to give way to hope fear and greed success is a lousy teacher it seduces smart people into thinking they cant lose if you have integrity nothing else matters if you don�t have integrity nothing else matters mark twain john templeton
