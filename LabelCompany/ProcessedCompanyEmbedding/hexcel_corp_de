superior material in applications where high strength and minimum weight are required in textile form this strength can be unidirectional or bidirectional allowing flexibility in design and costfire resistance glass fiber is an inorganic material and will not burn or support combustion it retains approximately  of its initial strength at °f °cchemical resistance most chemicals have little or no effect on glass fiber the inorganic glass textile fibers will not mildew rot or deteriorate glass fibers are affected by hydrofluoric hot phosphoric acids and strong alkaline substanceselectrical properties glass fiber is an excellent material for electrical insulation the combination of properties such as low moisture absorption high strength heat resistance and low dielectric constant makes fiber glass fabrics ideal as a reinforcement for printed circuit boards and insulating varnishesthermal conductivity a low coefficient of thermal expansion combined with high thermal conductivity properties makes glass fabric a dimensionally stable material that rapidly dissipates heat as compared to asbestos and organic fibers  resources datasheets  woven reinforcements products  contact
