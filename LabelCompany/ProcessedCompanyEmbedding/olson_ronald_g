solutions origins martha morris was inspired to develop the play it again sports concept in  when she had trouble reselling a nearly new 0 backpack she borrowed  from a friends parents and the two women started a used sporting equipment store in a vacated tombstone shop near a minneapolis cemetery morris bought out her friend within a few months boosted by local television coverage she sold about  of used equipment during her first year of business initially she sold everything on consignment but she later began buying used equipment outright and selling new goods such as sales representative samples last years models and retailers outofseason equipment financial success and customer feedback told morris the idea could work elsewhere so in mid she went to a franchise development consulting firm for help k jeffrey dahlberg and ronald g olson the owners of franchise business systems inc fbs had their doubts at first about the potential for a used sporting goods chain in a  fortune magazine article olson said her store looked like a garage sale with hours nevertheless the numbers showed them she was also pulling in a lot of business so fbs took her on as a client the minneapolis star tribune for march   dick youngblood wrote her instincts were bullseye accurate despite limited capital the business grew in  months to  franchise operations in six states taking  revenues to more than  which included sales at the two stores morris owned then plus the franchise and royalty fees sales of the franchised stores alone totaled  million dahlberg and olson used their combined expertise to polish the entrepreneurial nugget into a gemstone dahlberg acquired his franchising knowhow in his familyrun hearingaid business he began developing the miracle ear centers network when he was named president of dahlberg inc in  however the combination of uneven earnings and franchise startup costs of 0 to  million caused friction with his father and a power struggle with a group of california investment firms that held  percent of the company stock in  only a few months after being named ceo of dahlberg inc he left the company a friend introduced dahlberg to olson who had  years of retail experience with companies such as dayton hudson corporation and on his own the two men formed fbs in  as a franchise development marketing and investment firm among the franchise systems they helped build were a 0store eyecare chain and a store drycleaning chain olson was left to run the daytoday business of the consulting firm while dahlberg reconciled with his father and returned to lead the hearingaid business in  play it again sports in s in  dahlberg and olson bought the franchising operation of play it again sports for more than  million plus five years of royalty payments dahlberg became chairman and olson served as president and ceo of the company the next year morris decided to sell them her three retail stores as well but she signed on as a consultant by the end of   play it again sports franchise stores were open in  states and canada in january  dahlberg and olson purchased sports traders inc an independent wholesaler owned by jim van buskirk an early owner of play it again sports van buskirk acquired a  percent interest in the first morris store in  but the next year he left to develop his own play it again sports stores the wholesale business he started supplied both his and morriss stores with new goods to supplement the selection of used sporting equipment purchased from the public as part of the purchase agreement van buskirks play it again sports stores continued to operate separately from the growing franchise system play it again sports franchises were being sold at a rapid pace dahlberg and olson were able to draw from a pool of middle managers displaced by corporate downsizing the men believed the play it again sports concept could be translated into other retail areas and began acquiring successfully established businesses in the used goods market in november  dahlberg and olson purchased franchising and royalty rights from once upon a child inc a columbus ohiobased store chain selling childrens clothing furniture and toys the chain had been started by local retailers dennis and lynn blum in  dahlberg resigned as president and ceo of dahlberg inc at the end of

had experienced an annual growth rate of  percent in terms of total revenues over the past five years in an investors business daily article by claire mencke olson pointed out that initially the companys rapid growth was unexpected but it happened that we brought together a lot of trends value pricing starting with the used product the trend in recycling and the availability of a lot of stripshopping center real estate despite the acclaim  also had its bleaker moments grow biz stock price fell by  percent in october when lowerthanexpected third quarter earnings were announced according to an october   star tribune article the earnings setback was caused by a reduction in the projected number of store openings for the year due to a tight stripmall real estate market and losses related to foreign investments company perspectives winmark corporation develops franchises and operates value oriented retail concepts for stores that buy sell trade and consign quality used and new merchandise each franchise emphasizes the ultimate in consumer value by offering high quality used merchandise at substantial savings and by purchasing or accepting as trade customers used goods that have been outgrown or are no longer used new merchandise is offered to supplement the selection of used goods the company had begun to franchise play it again sports stores internationally in  in  grow biz entered into joint venture agreements to franchise stores in europe and mexico however toward yearend  grow biz withdrew from the mexican market closing both of its corporateowned stores the company also suffered losses in its corporateowned german venture but the franchised stores there continued to operate in corporate report minnesota for april  lee schafer noted that the play it again sports franchises were moneymakers for their owners a situation that was atypical of the franchise environment at the time however schafer pointed out that analysts had some reservations about the other concepts the computer stores faced uncertainty related to rapidly changing technology the strength of franchisees among the kids clothes and toys concept was being questioned and the disc businesses faced stiff competition from new disc sellers olson disputed this and said in the same article that grow biz was concentrating on becoming operationally strong in all five concept areas grow biz gave its franchisees support and assistance in the following areas advertising and marketing centralized buying and warehouse services pointofsale computerized information systems management training and store opening assistance it also provided periodic field support visits the franchisees were generally required to comply with guidelines regarding store design the use of

among computer renaissances best customers were firsttime computer buyers and sellers and small business owners the company also purchased used computers from corporations upgrading their systems and from liquidators only about  percent of store inventory was new unlike the other grow biz concepts which typically purchased used goods ready for resale the corporation refurbished used computers and provided franchise operations with technical assistance revenues for the  us and canadian stores in operation in  were  million compact disc industry sales grew by  percent in  according to company figures with disc go round grow biz was positioning itself to capitalize on the strength of the relatively new industry plus the growing cdrom market disc go rounds  revenues were  million and all of

buying and reselling used and reconditioned tools in much the same manner as the other grow biz franchises retool aimed at the typical consumer looking to sell tools he no longer needed and buy tools he did need at a discount olson said a may  article by susan reda in stores that grow biz raised the bar in terms of consumers expectations of used goods he went on to say theres no longer a stigma attached to buying used items changes in the st century grow biz had seen a growth in the number of stores in the s but that growth was apparently too fast in  the company showed a loss of  the s saw big changes at the company john morgan acquired control of grow biz in  a former partner in winthrop leasing morgan had sold his company and retired in  however retirement did not suit him and morgan
