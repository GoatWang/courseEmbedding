specific circumstances of each investment for private company investments we are typically appointed to the board and have an active level of engagement with the business for public company investments the support we offer may simply be the role we play as a stable committed shareholder and provider of long term “patient” capital alternatively we can also have a more active involvement similar to our private company investments which can include being appointed to the board for many of the companies in which we invest we have a deep relationship with the management team and board
