alliedsignalcategory trainingbuidling a finance team by providing employees with exposure to business units alliedsignals cfo transformed finance training into a learning laboratory roy harris cfo magazineoctober   in a way alliedsignal incs dedication to finance training seems almost a defensive strategy when you think of the job market and how competitive it is today you have to work hard to retain people says cfo richard f wallman the alliedsignal answer to that challenge use training as a career enabler he says youve got to take care of your key people and theyve got to know theres a process to give them opportunities for the key jobs the morristown new jersey­based maker of high technology products for the aerospace automotive and other industries has remade its finance training operation in four years under wallman the backdrop for it all is the drive to make finance employees integral players throughout the value chain providing the expertise to capture distill and act on global information as wallman puts it so today company training programs expose alliedsignals  finance professionals  from their earliest days at the companyto a variety of job environments many are outside the treasury and controller functions and in industries beyond their normally assigned ones and within those environments these finance professionals are challenged to apply the six sigma principals of quality improvement cycletime reduction and cost savings to a range of administrative processesa system that in effect provides an internal learning laboratory it is its prowess in tying instructional programs to problems within the companys  global business units that won alliedsignal the  cfo excellence award for trainingbuilding a finance team and key to that success says lawrence a bossidy alliedsignals chairman and ceo is wallman richard has paid close personal attention to establishing and strengthening our finance teams training curriculum he says and has eagerly assumed a personal role as mentor and coach to many of the organizations top finance leaders as well as recently hired graduates all the while the company has been a financial beacon in its industries earnings grew  percent last year to  billion on a  percent upward step in sales to  billion while free cash flow soared  percent for example and to the yearold wallman the link is obvious it is through our relentless dedication to developing great people he says that we will continue to grow and be a premier company distinctive and successful pathways to successioncompanywide what alliedsignal calls training is actually a comprehensive program that starts with individual job modeling includes a regularly revised curriculum talent reviews and performance management and progresses all the way through succession planning in finance that model has an additional elementthe immersion of employees into the broader world of the business units it starts with the finance pathways program an early career training that provides tough new job assignments on a threeyear rotational basis augmented by targeted classroom work the goal is to ensure that finance mbas will have three challenging assignments of broadened responsibility within the first three years of their careers the cfo says managers furthermore get to see what happens when high potential individuals find themselves accountable for important bottom line results from the moment they walk in the door the rotations serve another valuable purpose to intersperse finance expertise throughout the company and the promotion record under pathways attests to its success last year in fact  of  active participants entered the second and third rotations with  percent of them moved across business units not that finance itself is neglected in fact succession planning in finance is closely tied to the highpotential people that training identifies its all considered part of an elaborate educationanddevelopment network at alliedsignal which culminates in a finance talent review process last year  open positions were filled in finance companywide eightyone percent of the jobs went to internal candidatesfor an increase of  percent in internal jobfillings compared with  in addition jobs were filled in an average of  days compared with a morethan day cycle time the prior year behind the effectiveness in moving people up is an extremely pragmatic curriculum revised every  to  months to reflect specific company needs the finance curriculum is built around action and resultsoriented learning programs wallman says with classes infused with the companys culture and case studies that have practical application in everyday projects finance managers teach almost every class and a hallmark of the instruction is use of the corporatewide six sigma qualityimprovement standards six sigma techniques pioneered by motorola inc are also taught separately to every finance employee first in the form of a sixday greenbelt course and later as an option through a fourweek master black belt course of instruction constant reinventiontraining at alliedsignal wasnt always such a servant to specific corporate needs wallman says he remembers that when he first arrived some past progress in finance training and other areas had been overstated the company had taken some pride in its reengineering of receivables for example but while there had certainly been improvements such as centralized credit collection he says in reality we had done an average job receivables thus became a prime early target for case work in finance training and especially for six sigma applications the result of this troubleshooting in  we had  million to  million more in cash coming through receivables and inventory management the revisitation of receivables is typical of a broader perspective at the company when we say nothing is sacred we really mean it says wallman its an approach he says that starts with ceo bossidy an expert in focusing on the central issues addressing them and moving on wallman credits bossidy with instilling the widely held view at alliedsignal that the entire company must be reinvented every few years through targeted retraining it was operating excellence in ­ then the move to six sigma in ­ wallman says of the thrusts of improvement over the years and the focus now is on enhancing six sigma and e commerce significantly in the alliedsignal vision new philosophies are translated quickly to front line practice using training as a major instrument of change and drawing on the cross functional reach of the finance department this process of constant reinvention however hinges on the openness to change that training helps instill among employeesand the feedback that comes during alliedsignals elaborate managementreview program unlike the situation at many other companies where lip service is given to reviews we really do sit down once a year and talk about where employees want to go with their careers what skills do they need then we tailor a program to help them achieve that wallman says one downsidethere is a downside to all this success in training however alliedsignal takes some pride in following in the footsteps of general electric co known as one of the great financetraining powerhouses i think they have great training practices and weve deployed several of them he says but theres really good and bad news in our becoming a minige wallman says ge is known for supplying the ranks of other companies with cfos among a range of toplevel executives and thats the bad news four former alliedsignal people recently have moved on to become ceos of other companies and four more are cfos he says � cfo publishing corporation  all rights reserved
