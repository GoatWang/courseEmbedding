international inbound travel  is estimated to grow at a cagr of  to  bn in  from  bn in  the current population of india is  billion out of which th of the population is online ie  million q  says iamai data india has the third largest internet population in the world according to google india  will see  million internet users in india leaving us behind and edging towards the numbers in china

results at affordable costs by employing various analytical models and open source technologies in combination with sql and nosql databases these travel searches consider various variables such as distance from the customer’s specified preference facilities and the pricing deal compared to alternatives in air travel search tripborn uses analytical models to ensure that prices displayed on its website are consistent with those on airline sites since synchronization issues could occur across data sources a differentiated travel portal and engineering platform “we plan to architect design and implement the next generation serviceoriented travel portal to realize a classic business model with soa serviceoriented architecture paradigm it would provide our customers with composite travel packages through dynamic composition among travelrelated services from distributed providers and across business domains” said the founders further a comprehensive tripborn serviceoriented engineering platform tbsoeptm will be engineered and customized for travel portals based on a comprehensive research of existing travel platforms from world leaders and it is consciously ensured that issues that tend to become the bottlenecks in these highly successful portals are redressed and the resulting platform will incorporate efficient system design and development to support complete life cycle of ticketing process for all modes of transportation and services around these modes to make easy maneuver ability and ticketing experience for all use case scenarios with plans to incorporate this platform on the cloud with advanced analytics supported by machine learning deep learning and cognitive computing abilities the company seeks to provide device independent user interface across all popular mobility devices with support for major regional indian language support besides english and hindi “the platform will be driven by four models service metamodel process model business model and global information model these models support semantic description and rational operations of the application and facilitate travel service discovery process execution and business to business bb and business to consumer bc integrations” said deepak providing a professional implementation environment for serviceoriented travel portal which will have extendable and scalable elastic design to rapidly add other revenue stream transactions and processes the travel portal provides a real soa application and welldefined business and service cases to provide a globally comprehensive platform aiming to increase the portal’s manageability through the design of large granular services to be constructed from smaller ones to split up a complex problem into smaller problems solved independently “it will thus be easier to add new services update replace or remove existing services without affecting the others and it will be customizable for the serviceoriented systems of other transaction types related to travel besides ticketing using a similar framework and approaches to those presented in tbsoeptm platform” added sachin plans for the days ahead tripborn inc will be filing its s

operated by state run transport and private players it has builtin inclusive business model and technology to penetrate into the growing middleclass of india into rural and semiurban market for its growth founders speak q what are the challenges faced by you and your team deepak “one of the biggest challenges in the online travel space is to understand the requirements of future travel agents or reps they are not just responsible for itineraries and welfare but also are data analysts who understand customers in their remit from their online behavior as much as their facial expressions other than choice price and schedule otas need to manage increasing the diverse supply base by overcoming technological constraints to deliver smarter travel experience authenticity of information and most importantly grievance redressal of customers the growth of the indian ota market has attracted leading global otas to the country leading indian otas have been successful in capturing market share because they understand the psyche of local customers and customize their solutions accordingly international players may however take some time to understand the market and capture market share especially in building the distribution network given the diversity of the unorganized ecosystem of indian travel players low entry barriers large market size and high levels of user acceptance continue to attract several smaller players to the ota space a lot of these new entrants resort to aggressive pricing strategies heavy discounts and offers high commissions to affiliatesvendors during sale period which has resulted in significant pressure on the margins of players across the industry there is low penetration of the online bus ticketing services segment in india the online presence of bus operators would increase their visibility since it would enable easier access to information for tourists although there is significant scope for expansion the low adoption of technology by bus operators and the fragmented nature of the bus industry hamper growth players need to therefore quickly invest in technology or risk losing out on a significant share of potential customers” sachin “managing hotel reservations and tour packages involve higher customer engagement as it entails managing relationships with numerous hotels and tour operators across india and in the absence of effective management if hotels and tour operators are not able to fulfill their commitments the reputation of otas will be under threat for customers who book tickets through themtill date most otas have focused on the urban population due to the availability of internet access and the presence of affluent people who purchase domesticinternational air tickets and their reach is limited in rural areas and tier iiiii cities due to low internet penetration and low literacy besides although rising income levels have resulted in the credit and debit card penetration in india their online usage is limited due to apprehensions about security online additionally a large chunk of the indian population does not have access to the banking services hence otas should offer cash on delivery options to serve the large unbanked sector as well as to those who are apprehensive of making bankingonline transactions” “our goal as a company is to enable smarter travel experience and have customer service

market for travel services and products in india is highly competitive we currently compete with both established and other emerging providers of travel services and products including other online travel agencies as well as traditional travel agencies tour operators travel suppliers and operators of travel industry reservation databases large established internet search engines have also launched applications offering travel itineraries in destinations around the world and metasearch companies who can aggregate travel search results also compete with us for customers established otas such as makemytripcom cleartripcom expediacoin travelocitycoin yatracom goibibocom bookingcom and agodacom have achieved strong brand recognition and reliability in india since the travel industry is a highvolume lowmargin business it can be difficult for emerging participants such as us to capture a meaningful share of the market from otas with established brands and resources we intend to build our brand in the underserved rural and semirural markets through our superior serviceoriented travel portal we believe that being a later market entrant allows us to develop a superior platform with uptodate technologies certain of our travel suppliers have also been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites and decreasing or eliminating their dependence on thirdparty distributors like us for instance many lowcost airlines may subject to applicable regulations reduce or eliminate commissions to agents such as us or restrict the amount of service fees we are able to charge customers suppliers who sell on their own websites typically do not charge a processing fee and in some instances offer advantages such as their own bonus miles or loyalty points which could make their offerings more attractive to customers than offerings like ours company description we are an online travel agency sometimes referred to as an ota that offers travel reservations and

expand our operations throughout panindia as opportunities present with an immediate focus on the states of gujarat maharashtra rajasthan delhi and madya pradesh   our strategy   india’s rapidly growing economy and rising middle class are driving growth in india’s travel and tourism industry   we use sophisticated information technology to offer a wide inventory of travel services via our website to offline travel agents who serve the growing middle class of travelers in semiurban and rural regions of india through our proprietary technology we consolidate and provide our travel agents with access to travel bookings and hotel reservations that otherwise would be costly and timeconsuming to obtain for their customers in an oftenfragmented marketplace while some of our more established competitors have focused on selling directly to consumers in urban areas our travel agent partners tend to be small brick and mortar establishments that serve travelers who rely on more personalized transactions for their travel booking needs due to language barriers and lack of access to the internet andor credit cards we have grown our operations through referrals and a focus on addressing our customers’ needs through technology as internet penetration in india increases we anticipate that we will be in a position to use our established platform to offer travel services and products directly to consumers   distribution and intellectual property   we manage our ota business through travelcord our proprietary internetbased online transaction platform we engineered our

and you could lose your investment   risks related to our business   we are a development stage company with a limited operating history which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance   we have a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our future performance our operating subsidiary was incorporated under the laws of india in  and it began to focus its operations on the online travel industry in february  our senior management has limited experience in the online travel industry and we still are in the process of fully developing our online platform and product offerings we have generated revenues over a limited operating history and have incurred net losses as a result of our short operating history we have only limited financial data and business information with which to evaluate our business strategies performance and investment in our common stock   we have incurred net losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future   we expect to incur operating losses in future periods as we incur significant expenses associated with the initial startup of our business our expenses will continue to increase as we continue to develop the operations necessary to further our business plan we cannot now determine the amount by which our expenses will increase as we grow and hire additional employees implement our sales marketing and distribution plans pursue contractual arrangements and partnerships and develop our internetbased infrastructure further we

loss of your investment   we are a holding company and rely on dividends distributions and other payments advances and transfers of funds from our subsidiary to meet our obligations   we are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own as a result we are largely dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our indian operating subsidiary to meet our obligations the deterioration of income from or other available assets of our indian operating subsidiary for any reason could limit or impair its ability to pay dividends or other distributions to us which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations   our lack of insurance leaves us exposed to significant liabilities   we do not carry insurance for the risks that our business may encounter any significant liability may require us to pay substantial amounts which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations if we are able to continue in business at all   the requirements of being a public company including compliance with the reporting requirements of the exchange act and the requirements of

offering we will need to comply with new laws regulations requirements and certain corporate governance provisions under the exchange act and the sarbanesoxley act complying with these statutes regulations and requirements will occupy a significant amount of time of our board of directors and management and will significantly increase our costs and expenses and will make some activities more timeconsuming and costly in connection with becoming a reporting company we will need to     ÿ institute a more comprehensive compliance function     ÿ prepare and distribute periodic and current reports under the federal securities laws     ÿ establish new internal policies such as those related to insider trading and     ÿ involve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants   our ongoing compliance efforts will increase general and administrative expenses and may divert management’s time and attention from the development of our business which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we estimate that we may incur approximately  in costs during the fiscal year ending march   and  in the fiscal year ending march   in connection with becoming a public company               our lack of experienced accounting staff may impact our ability to report our future financial results on a timely and accurate basis and we need to retain the services of additional accountants and consultants with required accounting experience and expertise   with the exception of our chief financial officer our accounting and finance staff lacks depth and skill in the application of generally accepted accounting principles with respect to external financial reporting for exchange act reporting companies we also do not have an audit committee or a member of our board of directors who would satisfy the definition of an audit committee financial expert we intend to engage the services of additional accounting personnel to assist with our financial accounting and reporting requirements to develop our internal control over financial reporting and to produce timely financial reports until we do so we may experience difficulty producing reliable and timely financial statements which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information the market price of our stock to decline significantly we may be unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms and our business and financial condition could be harmed   we will not be required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section  of the sarbanesoxley act until the end of the second fiscal year reported on our second annual report on form k   we will not be required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section  of the sarbanesoxley act until the end of the second fiscal year reported on our second annual report on form k in addition as a smaller reporting company we will not be required to obtain an auditor attestation of management’s evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting once such internal controls are in place as a result we may fail to identify and remediate a material weakness or deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting which may cause our financial statements and related disclosure to contain material misstatements and could cause delays in filing required financial statements and related reports furthermore the process of designing and implementing internal controls over financial reporting may divert our internal resources and take a significant amount of time and expenditure to complete the actual or perceived risk associated with our lack of internal controls could cause investors lose confidence in our reported financial information which could negatively impact the market for our common stock and cause us to be unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all which could cause harm to our business and financial condition   we may not be successful in implementing our growth strategies   our growth strategies involve expanding our network of travel agents expanding our service and product offerings expanding supplier relationships enhancing our service platforms by investing in technology and expanding into new geographic markets within india the following factors may affect our success in implementing our growth strategies     ÿ our ability to increase the number of suppliers especially suppliers that are directlyconnected to us which depends on the willingness of such suppliers to invest in new technology     ÿ our ability to continue to expand our distribution channels and market and crosssell our travel services and products to facilitate the expansion of our business     ÿ our ability to build or acquire the required technology     ÿ the general condition of the global and indian economy and continued growth in demand for travel services particularly online     ÿ our ability to compete effectively with existing and new entrants to the indian travel industry including both online travel companies as well as traditional travel agents and tour providers and     ÿ the growth of the internet as a medium for commerce in india   many of these factors are beyond our control and there can be no assurance that we will succeed in implementing our strategy   we depend on certain related persons transactions and may continue to rely on related persons for key development and support activities   as described more fully in “certain relationships and related person transactions” we have entered into and may continue to enter into transactions with related persons we rely on associates and enterprises that our president and vice president control for key development and support activities while we believe that our related persons’ interests align with our own we may not have entered into such transactions on an arm’slength basis while we presently benefit from free services or deferred payments in the longterm we may have achieved more favorable terms had we entered into such transactions with unrelated parties in addition if these related persons withdrew their support from our business the associated loss of preferential business arrangements could significantly increase our operating costs and adversely affect our results of operations to the point that we might be forced to cease operations               we will not be able to develop or continue our business if we fail to attract and retain key personnel   our future success depends on our ability to attract hire train and retain a skilled senior management team and other key personnel the loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could adversely affect our business we face competition in securing qualified personnel possessing the skills necessary to implement our strategy and we may fail to attract or retain the employees necessary to execute our business model successfully   our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management and other personnel in particular we believe that our future success is highly dependent on the technical expertise financial support and key contracts and arrangements of our executive officers and directors deepak sharma and sachin mandloi messrs sharma and mandloi may voluntarily terminate their services at any time we have not entered into employment agreements with them and do not expect to enter into such agreements following the consummation of this offering if messrs sharma mandloi or any other key members of our management team leave the company our business could suffer and the value of our common stock would likely decline if we are able to continue in business at all   our significant stockholders exercise significant influence over our company and may have interests that are different from those of our other stockholders   immediately prior to this offering our sole directors deepak sharma and sachin mandloi beneficially owned  of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock if the selling stockholders sell all of the shares offered by this prospectus mr sharma and mr mandloi will beneficially own  of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock by virtue of such holdings they have the ability to exercise significant influence over our company and our affairs and business including the election of directors amendments to our charter and bylaws the approval of a merger or sale of substantially all our assets and the approval of most other actions requiring the approval of our stockholders the interests of these stockholders may be different from or conflict with the interests of our other stockholders and their influence may result in the delay or prevention of a change of management or control of our company   third parties claiming that we infringe on their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from operating our business   from time to time we may receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others including claims regarding copyrights and trademarks former employers of our former current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers any such claim with or without merit could result in costly litigation and distract management from daytoday operations if we are not successful in defending such claims we could be required to suspend certain services redesign our platform pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing arrangements we cannot assure you that any royalty or licensing arrangements that we may seek in such circumstances will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all we may incur significant expenditures to investigate defend and settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights   we need to expand our sales marketing and support organizations and our distribution arrangements to increase market acceptance of our products and services   we currently have a limited number of sales marketing customer service and support personnel and will need to increase our staff to generate a greater volume of sales and to support any new customers or the expanding needs of existing customers the employment market for sales marketing customer service and support personnel in our industry is very competitive and we may not be able to hire the kind and number of sales marketing customer service and support personnel we are targeting our inability to hire qualified sales marketing customer service and support personnel may harm our business operating results and financial condition   risks related to operations in india   our operations in india may be adversely affected by social and political uncertainties or change military activity healthrelated risks or acts of terrorism   from time to time india has experienced instances of civil unrest terrorism and hostilities among neighboring countries including pakistan terrorist attacks military activity rioting or civil or political unrest in the future could influence the indian economy and our operations by disrupting operations and communications and making travel within india more difficult and less desirable our industry particularly is sensitive to actual or perceived safety concerns such as these as well as healthrelated risks such as the influenza a virus hn avian flu hn and hn and severe acute respiratory syndrome or other epidemics or pandemics any of these events in or around india could cause the demand for travelrelated services to decline political or social tensions also could create a greater perception that investments in companies with indian operations involve a high degree of risk which could adversely affect the market and price for our common stock we do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks military conflicts and wars which could subject us to significant financial losses the realization of any of these risks could cause a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows andor share price          our results of operations are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates   our presentation currency is the us dollar however the functional currency of our operating subsidiary is the indian rupee any fluctuation in the value of the indian rupee against the us dollar such as the approximately five percent drop in the average value of the indian rupee as compared to the us dollar during  will affect our results of operations we expect to be adversely affected by any further depreciation of the indian rupee against the us dollar   our bank accounts in india are not insured or protected against loss and the failure of any bank in which we deposit our funds could affect our ability to continue in business   we maintain our cash in india with both private and stateowned banks located in india these cash accounts are not insured or otherwise protected against loss should any bank holding our cash deposits become insolvent or if we are otherwise unable to withdraw funds we would lose the cash on deposit with that particular bank loss of cash deposits or the inability to access such cash deposits could impair our operations and if we are not able to access funds to pay our service providers and employees we may be unable to continue in business     if we violate applicable anticorruption laws or our internal policies designed to ensure ethical business practices we could face financial penalties andor reputational harm that would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations   we are subject to anticorruption and antibribery laws in the united states and india india’s reputation for potential corruption and the challenges presented by india’s complex business environment may increase our risk of violating applicable anticorruption laws our commercial relationships with stateowned enterprises may further intensify this risk we face the risk that we our employees or any third parties such as our sales agents and distributors that we engage to do work on our behalf may take action determined to be in violation of anticorruption laws in any jurisdiction in which we conduct business including the foreign corrupt practices act of  “fcpa” india’s prevention of money laundering act  and indian penal code any violation of the fcpa or any similar anticorruption law or regulation could result in substantial fines sanctions civil andor criminal penalties and curtailment of operations that might harm our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we have internal ethics policies with which we require our employees to comply in order to ensure that we conduct our business in a manner that our management deems appropriate if these anticorruption laws or internal policies were to be violated our reputation and operations could also be substantially harmed further detecting investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management   natural disasters could have a negative impact on the indian economy and cause our business to suffer   india has experienced natural disasters such as earthquakes tsunamis floods and drought in the past few years for example in november and december  chennai the frequently visited capital city of tamil nadu experienced historic flooding that closed its airport for several days and suspended rail service in addition in september  the state of jammu and kashmir in northern india another popular tourism destination experienced widespread floods and landslides the extent and severity of these natural disasters determines their impact on the indian economy substantially all of our operations and employees are located in india and our operations may be adversely affected by natural disasters in the future furthermore if any of these natural disasters occur in tourist destinations in india travel within india could be adversely affected which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance   necessary infrastructure upgrades in india may not keep pace with increasing internet penetration which may adversely affect our operations and require us to make additional investments and expenditures   our customers complete their bookings through our indian website in november  the internet and mobile association of india forecasted that india’s internet user population would reach  million users by december  a  year over year increase slowdowns or disruptions in upgrading india’s internetbased infrastructure to meet this demand could reduce the rate of expected increases in the use of the internet and our internetbased services which may adversely affect our business and results of operations in addition any slowdown or negative deviation in the anticipated increase in internet penetration in india may require us to make additional investments in alternative distribution channels which could strain our financial and human resources causing our operations and financial condition to suffer          restrictions on foreign investment in india may prevent us from making future acquisitions or investments in india including with respect to our operating subsidiary which may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and financial performance   india regulates ownership of indian companies by foreigners these regulations and restrictions may apply to acquisitions by us of shares in indian companies or the provision of funding by us to our indian operating subsidiary for example under its consolidated foreign direct investment policy the government of india has set out criteria for foreign investments in india including requirements with respect to downstream investments by indian companies owned or controlled by foreign entities and the transfer of ownership or control of indian companies in sectors with caps on foreign investment from resident indian persons or entities to foreigners these requirements which currently include restrictions on valuations and sources of funding for such investments and may include prior approval from the foreign investment promotion board may adversely affect our ability to make investments in india including through our operating subsidiary in india there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any required approvals for future acquisitions or investments in india or that we will be able to obtain such approvals on satisfactory terms   we may incur expenses including penalties imposed by the reserve bank of india if we do not comply or timely comply with reporting requirements in connection with the acquisition and transfer of our securities by our indian employees   under regulations of the reserve bank of india our operating subsidiary is subject to periodic reporting requirements in connection with the acquisition and transfer of our securities by indian residents including with respect to our employees who acquire our shares under employee stock option plans if we fail to meet our reporting requirements the reserve bank of india may impose penalties or take other action that could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations   we are subject to regulatory and political uncertainties in india   we conduct substantially all of our business and operations in india consequently government policies and regulations including tax policies in india will impact our financial performance and the market price of our common stock   the government of india has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the indian economy since  successive indian governments have generally pursued policies of economic liberalization and financial sector reforms including by significantly relaxing restrictions on the private sector nevertheless the role of the indian central and state governments in the indian economy as producers consumers and regulators has remained significant and we cannot assure you that such liberalization policies will continue the present government has continued to take initiatives that support the economic growth of the country that have been pursued by previous governments however there is no assurance that it will be able to generate sufficient crossparty support to implement such  initiatives the rate of economic liberalization could change and specific laws and policies affecting travel service companies foreign investments currency exchange rates and other matters affecting investments in india could change as well a significant change in india’s policy of economic liberalization and deregulation or any social or political uncertainties could adversely affect business and economic conditions in india generally and our business and prospects   we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities   as a usbased holding company that provides services in india through our operating subsidiary we are subject to income taxes and nonincome based taxes in the united states and in india due to economic and political conditions tax rates and tax regimes in the jurisdictions in which we are located and operate may be subject to significant change our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation although we believe that our tax filing positions are reasonable and comply with applicable laws the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals if our effective tax rates were to increase our cash flows financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected   judgments that our stockholders obtain against us may not be enforceable    substantially all of our assets are located outside of the united states and substantially all of our revenue is derived outside of the united states in addition our director sachin mandloi resides in india and our executive officer and director deepak sharma spends a significant amount of time in india as a result it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within the united states upon these persons it is uncertain whether the courts of india would recognize or enforce judgments of united states or state courts against us or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the laws of the united states or any state in addition there is uncertainty as to whether such indian courts would be competent to hear original actions brought in india against us or such persons predicated upon the laws of the united states or any state   risks related to our industry   we rely on information technology to operate our business and maintain our competitiveness and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business   we depend on the use of sophisticated information technology and systems which we have customized for search and reservation for flights and hotels as well as payments refunds customer relationship management communications and administration as our operations grow in both size and scope we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer our customers enhanced services features and functionality while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure in a costeffective manner our future success also depends on our ability to upgrade our services and infrastructure ahead of rapidly evolving consumer demands while continuing to improve the performance features and reliability of our service in response to competitive offerings          if the number of travel agents using our services increases substantially or if critical thirdparty systems stop operating as designed we may need to significantly expand and upgrade our technology transaction processing systems financial and accounting systems and other infrastructure we may not be able to upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such conditions in a timely manner and depending on the thirdparty systems affected our transactional financial and accounting systems could be impacted for a meaningful amount of time before upgrade expansion or repair   we may not be able to use new technologies effectively or we may fail to adapt our website transaction processing systems and network infrastructure to meet consumer requirements or emerging industry standards if we face material delays in introducing new or enhanced solutions our customers may forego the use of our services in favor of those of our competitors any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operations   the travel industry in india is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively   the travel market in india is highly competitive factors affecting our competitive success include price availability and breadth of choice of travel services and products brand recognition customer service fees charged to travelers ease of use accessibility and reliability we currently compete with both established and other emerging providers of travel services and products including other online travel agencies in india and abroad such as makemytripcom cleartripcom expediacoin travelocitycoin yatracom goibibocom bookingcom and agodacom as well as traditional travel agencies tour operators travel suppliers and operators of travel industry reservation databases large established internet search engines have also launched applications offering travel itineraries in destinations around the world and metasearch companies that can aggregate travel search results also compete against us for customers certain of our competitors have launched brand marketing campaigns to increase their visibility with customers for example trivagocom has commenced a television advertising campaign in india some of our competitors have significantly greater financial marketing personnel and other resources than us and certain of our competitors have a longer history of established businesses and reputations in the indian travel market particularly in the hotels and vacation packages business as compared with us from time to time we may be required to reduce service fees and net revenue margins in order to compete effectively and maintain or gain market share   some travel suppliers are seeking to decrease their reliance on distribution intermediaries such as us by promoting direct distribution channels many airlines hotels car rental companies and tour operators have call centers and have established their own travel distribution websites and mobile applications from time to time travel suppliers offer advantages such as bonus loyalty awards and lower transaction fees or discounted prices when their services and products are purchased from supplierrelated channels we also compete with competitors who may offer less content functionality and marketing reach but at a relatively lower cost to suppliers if our access to supplierprovided content or features were to be diminished either relative to our competitors or in absolute terms or if we are unable to compete effectively with travel supplierrelated channels or other competitors our business could be materially and adversely affected   we depend on and expect to continue to depend on a small number of low cost airlines in india for a significant percentage of our air ticketing revenue   four low cost airlines dominate india’s domestic air travel industry as we derive a substantial portion of our air ticketing revenue through the base commissions and incentive payments of these domestic airlines our dependence on a limited number of domestic airlines means that a reduction or elimination in base commissions and incentive payments by any one or all of these airlines could have a material adverse effect on our revenue   in addition our reliance on a small number of airline suppliers in india gives those airline suppliers additional bargaining power in negotiating agreements with us a reduction or elimination of base commissions and incentive payments by any of these domestic airline suppliers the loss of any of these domestic airline suppliers or a domestic airline supplier exerting significant price and margin pressure on us could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   our processing storage use and disclosure of customer data of our agents or visitors to our website could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirements differing views of personal privacy rights or data security breaches   in the processing of our agent transactions we receive and store a large volume of customer information such information increasingly is subject to legislation and regulations in various jurisdictions and governments are increasingly acting to protect the privacy and security of personal information that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded or amended to require changes in our business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations as privacy and data protection become more sensitive issues in india we may also become exposed to potential liabilities for example under the indian information technology act  as amended our operating subsidiary is subject to civil liability for wrongful loss or gain arising from any negligence in implementing and maintaining reasonable security practices and procedures with respect to sensitive personal data or information on our computer systems networks databases and software india has also implemented privacy laws including the information technology reasonable security practices and procedures and sensitive personal data or information rules  which impose limitations and restrictions on the collection use and disclosure of personal information any liability we may incur for violation of such laws and regulations and related costs of compliance and other burdens may adversely affect our business and profitability          we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent data breaches companies that handle such information have also been subject to investigations lawsuits and adverse publicity due to allegedly improper disclosure of personally identifiable information security breaches could damage our reputation cause interruptions in our operations expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and could also cause customers and potential customers to lose confidence in the security of our transactions which would have a negative effect on the demand for our services and products moreover public perception concerning security and privacy on the internet could adversely affect customers’ willingness to use our websites a publicized breach of security in india even if it only affects other companies conducting business over the internet could inhibit the growth of the internet as a means of conducting commercial transactions and therefore the prospects of our business   these and other privacy and security developments that are difficult to anticipate could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   if we are unable to maintain existing or establish new arrangements with our travel suppliers our business may be adversely affected   our business depends on our ability to maintain our relationships and arrangements with existing suppliers as well as our ability to establish and maintain relationships with new travel suppliers a substantial portion of our revenue less service cost derives from fees and commissions negotiated with travel suppliers for bookings made through our website many of our agreements with our travel suppliers are shortterm contracts that require periodic renewal on a quarterly or yearly basis and provide our counterparties with a right to terminate on short notice or without notice adverse changes in existing arrangements including an inability by any travel supplier to fulfill its payment obligation to us in a timely manner increasing industry consolidation or our inability to enter into or renew arrangements with these parties on favorable terms if at all could reduce the amount quality pricing and breadth of the travel services and products that we are able to offer which could adversely affect our business and financial performance   we do not have formal arrangements with many of our travel suppliers   we rely on travel suppliers to facilitate the sale of our travel services we do not have formal agreements with many of our travel suppliers including many hotels whose booking systems or central reservations systems we rely on for bookings and confirmation as well as certain payment gateway arrangements we cannot assure you that these third parties will not terminate these arrangements with us on short notice or without notice termination nonrenewal or suspension or an adverse amendment of any of these arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by global andor domestic economic conditions   due to the discretionary nature of travel expenditures the travel industry tends to experience weak or reduced demand during economic downturns unfavorable changes in the business and economic conditions affecting our market could result in fewer reservations made through our websites andor lower our net revenue margins and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition during periods of poor economic conditions airlines and hotels tend to reduce rates or offer discounted sales to stimulate demand thereby reducing our commissionbased income the weakness and uncertainty in the global economy have negatively impacted both corporate and consumer spending patterns and demand for travel services globally and in india and may continue to do so in the future these poor economic conditions could adversely impact our growth plans business financial condition and results of operations   risks related to our common stock   there is no current trading market for our securities and if a trading market does not develop you may be unable to resell your shares   currently we do not have an established public trading market for our securities and an active trading market in our securities may not develop or if developed may not be sustained we intend to seek a market maker to apply for admission to quotation of our securities on the otc bulletin board however there can be no assurance that a market maker will agree to file the necessary documents with the financial industry regulatory authority nor can there be any assurance that such an application for quotation will be approved  if for any reason our securities are not quoted on the otc bulletin board or a public trading market does not otherwise develop purchasers of the securities may have difficulty selling their shares as a result you should purchase shares only as a longterm investment and you must be prepared to hold your shares for an indefinite period of time          we will require additional financing to support our operations which financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all any new equity financing could have a dilutive effect on our existing stockholders   we will require additional financing to sustain our business which may not be available on favorable terms if at all we estimate that we will require approximately  and  in the next  and  months respectively to continue operations and to grow our business we may seek additional funding through a combination of equity offerings debt financings or other thirdparty funding and other collaborations strategic alliances and licensing arrangements to fully implement our business plan for instance we recently issued convertible notes which may convert into shares of our common stock in the future if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities our stockholders may experience significant dilution in addition these new securities may contain certain rights preferences or privileges that are senior to those of the shares of our common stock which may decrease the value of your investment in our common stock further if we do not complete an underwritten public offering on a national securities exchange when these convertible notes mature in  we will be obligated to repay the principal amounts of these loans together with accrued interest which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we cannot obtain additional financing we will not be able to achieve the sales growth that we need to cover our costs and our results of operations would be negatively affected   the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors which may lead to volatility and a decrease in the price of our common stock   for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company we may take advantage of exemptions from reporting requirements that apply to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies investors may find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions which include not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved in addition section  of the jobs act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards we have elected to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with the revised accounting standards if investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of exemptions and reduced disclosure requirements there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile or may decrease   we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future therefore capital appreciation if any of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future   we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future we currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business as a result capital appreciation if any of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future   you may be subject to indian taxes on income arising through the sale of our common stock   in india the income tax act  provides that income arising directly or indirectly through the sale of a capital asset including shares of a company incorporated outside of india will be subject to tax in india if such shares derive directly or indirectly their value substantially from assets located in india whether or not the seller of such shares has a residence place of business business connection or any other presence in india if on the specified date the value of such assets located in india i exceeds a specified amount or ii represents at least fifty per cent of the value of all the assets owned by the company further the amendment does not deal with the interplay between this provision of indian tax law and the existing double tax avoidance treaties that india has entered into with the united states if the indian tax authorities determine that our common stock derives its value substantially from assets located in india and the provisions of any relevant double tax avoidance treaty are deemed to be inapplicable in this context you may be subject to indian income taxes on the income arising directly or indirectly through the sale of our common stock   our common stock will be and may continue to be subject to the “penny stock” rules of the sec which could make transactions in our common stock more cumbersome and may reduce the value of your investment in our common stock   rule g under the exchange act defines a “penny stock” as any equity security that has a market price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions to the extent a market develops for our common stock we anticipate that our common stock will be and may continue to be considered a penny stock in order to approve a person’s account for transactions in penny stocks the broker or dealer must a obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person and b make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks          the broker or dealer must also deliver prior to any transaction in a penny stock a disclosure schedule prescribed by the sec relating to the penny stock market which in highlight form a sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination and b confirms that the broker or dealer received a signed written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction generally brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the “penny stock” rules this may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and could depress the market value of our common stock to the extent a market develops   shares of our common stock that have not been registered under federal securities laws are subject to resale restrictions imposed by rule  including those set forth in rule i which apply to a former “shell company”   prior to acquiring our indian operating subsidiary we were a “shell company” under applicable sec rules and regulations because we had no or nominal operations and either no or nominal assets assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents or assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets resales pursuant to rule  promulgated under the securities act of  as amended or the securities act of the securities of a former shell company such as us are not permitted i until at least  months have elapsed from the april   initial filing of this prospectus which reflected our status as a nonshell company and ii unless at the time of a proposed sale we are subject to the reporting requirements of section  or d of the exchange act and have filed all reports and other materials required to be filed by section  or d of the exchange act as applicable during the preceding  months other than form k reports as a result any stockholders who receive shares in a transaction that is not registered under the securities act will be forced to hold their shares of our common stock for at least that month period before they are eligible to sell those shares pursuant to rule  and even after that month period sales may not be made under rule  unless we and the selling stockholders are in compliance with other requirements of rule  further it will be more difficult for us to raise funding to support our operations through the sale of debt or equity securities unless we agree to register such securities under the securities act which could cause us to expend significant time and cash resources additionally our previous status as a shell company could also limit our use of our securities to pay for any acquisitions we may seek to pursue in the future although none are currently planned the lack of liquidity of our securities as a result of the inability to sell under rule  for a longer period of time than a nonformer shell company could make an investment in our securities less attractive and could cause the share price of our common stock to decline                   special note regarding forwardlooking statements   this

section a of the securities act of  as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended expressly state that the safe harbor for forward looking statements does not apply to companies that issue penny stocks accordingly the safe harbor for forward looking statements under the pslra is not currently available to the company because we may be considered to be an issuer of penny stock   determination of offering price   following the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part we intend to apply for quotation of our common stock on the otc bulletin board until such time the selling stockholders will offer shares of our common stock offered by this prospectus at a price between  to  per share after our shares are listed on the otc bulletin board the selling stockholders will determine at what price they may sell their shares of common stock through privately negotiated transactions or otherwise at market prices at the time of sale   we determined the offering price of  to  per share based on a discounted cash flow analysis and a priceequity analysis relative to peer group companies the analyses that we completed yielded a value within the offering price range   the offering price of the shares of our common stock does not necessarily bear any relationship to our book value assets past operating results financial condition or any other established criteria of value the facts considered in determining the offering price based on the analyses above included our expected financial results our financial condition our cost of capital the peer group companies we selected the lack of an established market for our common stock and the minority interest the purchasers of our securities will hold our limited operating history and the general condition of the securities market   dilution   if you purchase securities in this offering your interest will be immediately and substantially diluted to the extent of the difference between the public offering price per share of our common stock and the as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our common stock after giving effect to this offering   our net tangible book value as of march   was approximately  or approximately  per share of common stock after giving effect to the sale of the shares of our common stock in this offering at the assumed

securities   the following description includes the material attributes of our capital stock this description is not complete and we qualify it by referring to our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws both of which we incorporate into this prospectus by reference   our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue  shares of capital stock divided into two classes     ÿ  shares of common stock  par value     ÿ  shares of preferred stock  par value   common stock   our common stock has one vote per share the holders of our common stock are entitled to vote on all matters to be voted on by stockholders the holders of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights   directors are elected by a plurality vote of the shares represented in person or by proxy all other actions by stockholders will be approved by a majority of votes cast except as otherwise required by law our amended and restated bylaws do not provide for

provisions   in the event of our liquidation dissolution or winding up the holders of common stock are entitled to share equally and ratably in all assets remaining available for distribution after payment of liabilities and after provision is made for each class of stock if any having preference over the common stock holders of common stock have no preemptive subscription redemption sinking fund or conversion rights the outstanding shares of common stock are validly issued fully paid and nonassessable   amendment of bylaws   our restated certificate of incorporation grants our board of directors the power to adopt amend or repeal our bylaws except as otherwise set forth in the bylaws   effects on our common stock if we issue preferred stock   our board of directors has authority without further action by the stockholders to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series our board of directors has the authority to determine the terms of each series of preferred stock within the limits of the restated certificate of incorporation and the laws of the state of delaware these terms include the number of shares in a series dividend rights liquidation preferences terms of redemption conversion rights and voting rights   the issuance of any preferred stock may negatively affect the holders of our common stock these possible negative effects include diluting the voting power of shares of our common stock and affecting the market price of our common stock          antitakeover effects of provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws   preferred stock   we believe that the availability of the preferred stock under our certificate of incorporation provides us with flexibility in addressing corporate issues that may arise having these authorized shares available for issuance allows us to issue shares of preferred stock without the expense and delay of a special stockholders’ meeting the authorized shares of preferred stock as well as shares of common stock will be available for issuance without further action by our stockholders unless action is required by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange on which our securities may be listed the board of directors has the power subject to applicable law to issue series of preferred stock that could depending on the terms of the series impede the completion of a merger tender offer or other takeover attempt that some or a majority of the stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then prevailing market price of the stock   advance notice provisions   our bylaws require that for a stockholder to nominate a director or bring other business before an annual meeting the

previous year or the date of the annual meeting of stockholders is advanced by more than  days or delayed by more than  days of such anniversary date we must receive notice of such nominations or other business no later than the close of business on the th day after the earlier of the mailing of the notice of the annual meeting of stockholders or the day on which we first make a public

actions against directors officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the court of chancery in the state of delaware although we believe this provision benefits the company and its stockholders by providing increased consistency in the application of delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us or our directors officers and employees   antitakeover effects of delaware law   section  of the delaware general corporation law the “dgcl” provides that subject to exceptions specified therein an “interested stockholder” of a delaware corporation shall not engage in any “business combination” including general mergers or consolidations or acquisitions of additional shares of the corporation with the corporation for a threeyear period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder unless     ÿ prior to such time the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder     ÿ upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an “interested stockholder” the interested stockholder owned at least  of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced excluding specified shares or     ÿ on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors of the corporation and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders and not by written consent by the affirmative vote of at least   of the outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder        under section  the restrictions

directors if such transaction is approved or not opposed by a majority of the directors who were directors prior to any person becoming an interested stockholder during the previous three years or were recommended for election or elected to succeed such directors by a majority of such directors the restrictions described above also do not apply to specified business combinations with a person who is an “interested stockholder” prior to the time when the corporation’s common stock is listed on a national securities exchange so these restrictions would not apply to a business combination with any person who is one of our stockholders prior to this offering   except as otherwise specified in section  an “interested stockholder” is defined to include     ÿ any person that is the owner of  or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation or is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and was the owner of  or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation at any time within three years immediately prior to the date of determination and     ÿ the affiliates and associates of any such person   under some circumstances section  makes it more difficult for a

of ahmedabad     we are a holding company organized in delaware in  deepak sharma who is an executive officer and director of the company formed our operating subsidiary sunalpha green technologies private limited under laws of the republic of india in  sunalpha commenced operations as an ota in india in february    prior to acquiring sunalpha in december  we operated as a shell company with nominal or no assets or operations we were known as pinstripesnyc inc until january  we filed reports with the securities and exchange commission under the securities exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act” from august  until we terminated the registration of our securities in may  our fiscal year ends on march  we refer to the fiscal year ended march   as fiscal  and the fiscal year ended march   as fiscal    we manage our online travel agency business through travelcord our proprietary internetbased online transaction platform through our website wwwtripborncom we offer a wide inventory of travel services and products to offline travel agents who serve the growing middle class of travelers in semiurban and rural regions of india through our proprietary technology we consolidate and provide our travel agents with access to travel bookings and hotel reservations that otherwise would be costly and timeconsuming to obtain for their customers in an oftenfragmented marketplace while some of our more established competitors have focused on selling directly to consumers in urban areas our travel agent partners tend to be small brick and mortar establishments that serve travelers who rely on more personalized transactions for their travel booking needs due to language barriers and lack of access to the internet or credit cards we have grown our operations through referrals and a focus on addressing our customers’ needs through sophisticated technology          we generate revenue through our ticketing business which includes rail ticketing bus ticketing and air ticketing and our hotel reservations and vacation and business packages business we also generate revenue by providing online payment services and access to visa processing services   in our ticketing business our main sources of revenue are  commissions and incentive payments from airline suppliers for tickets booked by our travel agent customers through our distribution channels and  service fees we charge our customers   historical operations and outlook   since commencing operations as an ota in february  we have grown our business by initially processing a few transactions a day to processing approximately  transactions per day in march  flight searches on our website have grown from a few per day in february  to over  flight searches per day in march  during the fiscal year  we have experienced increased traffic on our website due to our efforts in marketing and branding we have steadily worked to add suppliers in order to provide additional services and better pricing for our travel agent customers in the development stages we have relied on user feedback to enhance our core technology as internet penetration in india continues to increase we anticipate that we will be in a position to use our established platform to offer travel services and related services directly to consumers we believe our online platform is capable of managing hundreds of suppliers and millions of transactions in furtherance of our growth strategies   in november  we integrated the indian railway reservation system into our online platform using complex and scalable technology tools previously we provided rail ticketing through a third party supplier becoming a principle agent has resulted in and will continue to result in an increase in rail ticketing revenue associated with an increase in fees associated with enrolling our travel agent customers and usage fees for ticketing we have also experienced and anticipate that we will continue to see an increase in selling general and administrative expenses associated with hiring additional personnel and expanding our marketing activities in connection with the expanded rail ticketing services as well as an increase in legal and consulting expenses associated with becoming a reporting company with the securities and exchange commission or “sec”   assuming we are successful in enrolling new travel agents while retaining our existing travel agents we anticipate that we will achieve sustainable and predictable cash flow and revenue growth yearoveryear however there is no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our business model and achieving our operational and financial objectives   we expect to see an increase in bookings through our website and a corresponding increase in revenue in fiscal year  due to the recent expansion of our sales force and our expansion into the states of maharashtra and madya pradesh in fiscal year  we expect to expand into other neighboring states in india   critical accounting policies and estimates   in preparing our financial statements we make estimates assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on revenue income loss from operations and net income loss as well as the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet the application of our critical accounting policies requires an evaluation of a number of complex criteria and significant accounting judgments by us our management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly  actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions if actual results were to materially differ from these estimates the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition   our critical accounting polices include the following   change in control transaction and reverse recapitalization   the audited consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the company and sunalpha our wholly owned operating subsidiary all significant related party accounts and transactions between the company and sunalpha have been eliminated upon consolidation   the company was formed by two transactions the first being a change in control transaction on

of  of the outstanding shares of common stock of pinstripesnyc inc in connection with the stock purchase agreement among pinstripesnyc inc arna and maxim kelyfos llc dated december    pinstripesnyc inc changed its name to tripborn inc in january    in the second transaction completed on december   the company acquired substantially all of the outstanding shares of sunalpha which was incorporated under the laws of the republic of india in november  sunalpha is the acquirer for financial reporting purposes and tripborn is the acquired company consequently the assets liabilities and results of operations that are reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements prior to the december   transaction are those of sunalpha and are recorded using the historical cost basis the

and transactions as appropriate   our market   india’s rapidly growing economy and rising middle class are driving growth in india’s travel and tourism industry according to the international monetary fund “imf” india’s gross domestic product “gdp” grew at an estimated  in  and is projected to grow by  and  in each of  and  in  the national council for applied economic research estimated that the indian middle class would grow from  million people in  to  million people in  and would reach  million people by  according to the imf nominal per capital income of the indian population also is increasing all of these factors tend to increase discretionary spending in areas such as travel and leisure according to word travel  tourisms council’ economic impact  the travel and tourism sector in india has been increasingly contributing to overall gdp domestic tourists accounted for over  of the spending in           although internet penetration and use of debit and credit cards is rapidly increasing india continues to have a significant unbanked population particularly outside of urban areas according to the reserve bank of india approximately  of households do not have access to banking services according to india’s  census  of india’s population lives in rural areas while  live in semiurban areas in addition lower internet penetration and literacy rates in more rural areas mean that otas are unable to reach a significant portion of the population directly due to a combination of these factors semiurban and rural travelers are more likely to require an intermediary to book travel related services and products   our strategy   we manage our online travel agency business through travelcord our proprietary internetbased online transaction platform through our website wwwtripborncom we offer a wide inventory of travel services and products to offline travel agents who serve the growing middle class of travelers in semiurban and rural regions of india using our

in an often fragmented marketplace while some of our more established competitors have focused on selling directly to consumers in urban areas our travel agent partners tend to be small brick and mortar establishments that serve travelers who rely on more personalized transactions for their travel booking needs due to language barriers and lack of access to the internet or credit cards we have grown our operations through referrals and a focus on addressing our customers’ needs through sophisticated technology in the development stages we have relied on user feedback to enhance our core technology as internet penetration in india continues to increase we anticipate that we will be in a position to use our established platform to offer travel services and products directly to

city of ahmedabad in gurjarat but also operate in the states of maharashtra rajasthan and madya pradesh we are expanding our sales team and hiring employees to expand our marketing and sales efforts   competition   the market for travel services and products in india is highly competitive we currently compete with both established and other emerging providers of travel services and products including other online travel agencies as well as traditional travel agencies tour operators travel suppliers and operators of travel industry reservation databases large established internet search engines have also launched applications offering travel itineraries in destinations around the world and metasearch companies who can aggregate travel search results also compete with us for customers   established otas such as makemytripcom cleartripcom expediacoin travelocitycoin yatracom goibibocom bookingcom and agodacom have achieved strong brand recognition and reliability in india since the travel industry is a highvolume lowmargin business it can be difficult for emerging participants such as us to capture a meaningful share of the market from otas with established brands and resources we intend to build our brand in the underserved rural and semirural markets through our superior serviceoriented travel portal we believe that being a later market entrant allows us to develop a superior platform with uptodate technologies          certain of our travel suppliers have also been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites and decreasing or eliminating their dependence on thirdparty distributors like us for instance many lowcost airlines may subject to applicable regulations reduce or eliminate commissions to agents such as us or restrict the amount of service fees we are able to charge customers suppliers who sell on their own websites typically do not charge a processing fee and in some instances offer advantages such as their own bonus miles or loyalty points which could make their offerings more attractive to customers than offerings like ours see “risk factors — risks related to our industry — the travel industry in india is highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively”   intellectual property   we manage our online travel agency business through travelcord our proprietary internetbased online transaction

to evaluate our business strategies performance and investment in our common stock   we have incurred net losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future   we expect to incur operating losses in future periods as we incur significant expenses associated with the initial startup of our business our expenses will continue to increase as we continue to develop the operations necessary to further our business plan we cannot now determine the amount by which our expenses will increase as we grow and hire additional employees implement our sales marketing and distribution plans pursue contractual arrangements and partnerships and develop our internetbased infrastructure further we cannot guarantee that we will be

timeconsuming and costly in connection with becoming a reporting company we need to     · institute a more comprehensive compliance function     · prepare and distribute periodic and current reports under the federal securities laws     · establish new internal policies and     · involve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants   our ongoing compliance efforts will increase general and administrative expenses and may divert management’s time and attention from the development of our business which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we

material weakness or deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting which may cause our financial statements and related disclosure to contain material misstatements and could cause delays in filing required financial statements and related reports furthermore the process of designing and implementing internal controls over financial reporting may divert our internal resources
