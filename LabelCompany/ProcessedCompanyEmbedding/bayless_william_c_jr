bill bayless is the cofounder president and ceo of american campus communities inc the nation’s largest developer owner and manager of high quality student housing today more than  college students call one of american campus’  plus student properties “home” in more than  collegiate markets across america the company currently has a total enterprise value in excess of  billion the son and grandson of steelworkers bayless was born and raised in the northern panhandle of west virginia he started working at the age of  mowing lawns and detailing cars a first generation college student he attended west virginia university from  –  graduating from the college of business and economics with a bachelor of science in business administration bayless first forged his vision of what would someday become american campus communities while he was still a student at wvu working as a dishwasher grill cook night desk attendant and as a resident assistant at summit hall in the ’s the mainstream real estate industry avoided student housing – they saw operational risk undesirable tenants and a risky investment this was evidenced by the student slums that existed near many colleges and universities nationwide in the ’s bayless however saw students and parents as underserved consumers worthy of better products and services he saw the need for and the opportunity to provide modern high quality well amenitized student communities that could foster an environment conducive to academic achievement after his graduation from wvu bayless worked to establish student housing divisions within traditional realestate companies in columbus ohio and houston texas he found it difficult as these companies didn’t want to commit the capital and resources necessary to develop the specialized infrastructure and operating platforms geared toward the unique aspects of serving the student market nor did these traditional real estate companies have a true appreciation of the importance of creating and maintaining environments that were conducive to academic success in  with less than  in the bank the year old bayless moved his wife and two small children to austin texas where he cofounded american campus the new company which had four employees and one third party student housing management contract at inception soon established an ambitious mission statement “…to be the nation’s premier provider of quality student housing communities and services through a unique understanding of and an unrelenting commitment to students parents and educational institutions…” from  to  bayless grew american campus into a  million enterprise using expensive new york based venture capital once again however bayless felt that his vision and the company were being limited by their traditional real estate capital partners  who didn’t truly understand the student consumer or the student the housing business in  against great odds bayless facilitated the buyout his venture capital partners and led the student housing industry to a new plateau when american campus communities successfully consummated its ipo on the new york stock exchange becoming the first publicly traded student housing company in the nation  introducing the sector to wall street and mainstreaming student housing as an asset class among institutional investors this caused a paradigm shift in the overall weighted average cost of capital available to the entire student housing industry  it also provided the opportunity for bayless and his management team to freely implement their vision and business plan since its ipo american campus has been one of the top performing publicly traded real estate companies in america the company has averaged a compounded annual growth rate in net operating income in excess of  in addition the company’s portfolio has achieved average fall occupancy of  for the last eleven years and has produced positive same store growth in rental rate rental revenue and net operating income each and every year even during the great recession since its ipo acc stock has delivered a total shareholder return of or more than  outperforming the morgan stanley

campus achieved an investment grade rating from both moody’s and standard and poors in  american campus received national accolades when the company was named by forbes as one of “america’s  most trustworthy companies” acc has also been voted as one of the best companies to work for in its home state of texas on three separate occasions  bayless is credited with mainstreaming student housing
