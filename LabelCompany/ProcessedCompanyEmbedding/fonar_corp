fonar corp undervalued niche player in the world of mri scanners  fonar corporation nasdaqfonr  seeking alphasign in  join nowgoÂ»fonar corp undervalued niche player in the world of mri scannersaug   about fonar corporation fonr jack sadler longshort equity value special situations growth at reasonable pricesummaryopportunity arisen due to a decline in mri sales even as revenue and profits continue to growfonars patentprotected unique products are the best in market larger competitors are unable to compete with the company so an acquisition may be on the horizonpotential  upside based on conservative forward earningskey metrics figure  table is my own data supplied by tmx and nasdaq business description fonar corp nasdaqfonr is an advanced medical technology company specializing in magnetic resonance imaging mri ceo raymond v damadians claim to fame is the invention of the technology that led to the mri scanner back in the s his groundbreaking invention led damadian to the founding of his own firm fonar now operates through a fullyowned subsidiary health management corporation of america hmca providing nonmedical support such as repair and maintenance management and clerical services and directly through fonar corp in the manufacturing and selling of mri products business direction the company designs sells and services mri scanners and imaging centers the mri industry is extremely competitive and largely controlled by an oligopoly of  companies siemens otcpksiegy general electric nysege philips nysephg toshiba otcpktosbf and hitachi otcpkhthiy these  electrical giants together control  of the mri market share this is a depressing statistic at first because it appears fonar would be unable to compete with the big players this isnt completely true though fonars patentprotected upright mri is the only product that can compete with other imaging technologies that are threatening to replace existing mri scanners the conventional mri scanner requires patients to lie on their back while a somewhat terrifying and noisy machine scans and generates images unfortunately fixing patients in this position often means the source of the problem is never found new technologies using xray gamma or sound energy can accommodate patients in multiple positions and are therefore more likely to identify the source of a patients problem unlike companies using traditional mri scanners fonar will not need to compete with these new products the upright mri scanner can accommodate any number of positions and reduces the risk of radiation that is present in technologies using xrays or gamma this product is a key differentiator for fonar and the product is protected through a series of patents companies have tried and failed to use fonar technology in the past in  ge and hitachi were both sued by fonar for the violation of its patents proving that these bigname competitors cannot compete in its niche space fonar corp revenue comes from manufacturing and selling the upright multi position mri scanner sales took a dip in  and the market overreacted to the poor sales revenue however the company still posted revenue growth overall and solid profits in all other areas proving that sales isnt the biggest driver mri sales are hard to come by so management reacted to decreasing sales by redirecting resources to two of its main divisions the field service division and more significantly the companys management subsidiary health management corporation of america hmca the contractual obligation with clients to provide servicing and upgrades provides a recurring revenue stream of more than m annually hmca provides physician management and diagnostic service and is a whollyowned subsidiary of fonar hmca and its subsidiaries run  mri scanning centers in new york and florida and generate revenue through upgrading and expanding the existing mri scanning centers hmca is a key area for growth and over the last  years its revenue has drastically increased as the number of hmcamanaged mri centers has more than doubled since march  figure  depiction of hmca firm structure information from fy k operating earnings and revenue have consistently increased for each of the last  years despite the inconsistent sales revenue and consistent growth like this is a sign that management is conducting a solid business with a clear plan to grow and realize shareholder value figure  data provided by ford equity research fonar the upright multi position mri scanner enables fonar to compete in the mri space because the product is simply better than traditional mri scanners it is quieter and much more comfortable since it allows patients to be in any of multiple possible positions these advances mean fewer patients experience claustrophobia and a higher success rate in pinpointing the source of a patients problem fonar scanners are even able to identify certain types of cancer that would previously require an xray product the new fonar the patientfriendly mri isnt just advancement in technology  its a game changer the fonar is an openconcept fullsized room with magnetic poles in the centre patients can stay in any position parents can accompany children to hold and comfort them and patients can even watch tv to distract themselves surgeons will have degree access to patients in any angle or position fonar scanners will be the only ones able to accommodate obesity an epidemic growing very quickly and will be able to detect certain diseases and cancers that normally require an upright xray the company is yet to realize revenue from this product but as it continues to market and advertise it this will be a matter of time and a potential catalyst for brand recognition and earnings growth in the future reason for opportunity as previously mentioned sales of mri scanners and scanning facilities fell in  but fonar usually has a large backlog of orders to fulfill and even without the mri sales the physician services and hmca maintain a consistently increasing revenue stream and has seen massive growth in the last  years the fact is that this fantastic performance is hidden behind declining sales revenue a close look at the income statement shows how quickly this firm is really growing the operating margin and net profit margin tell a story of their own since even with the decrease in revenue from mri sales the company still maintains margins above  and remains consistently profitable figure  table is my own data from yahoo finance and bloomberg a second reason is the company size compared to the competition david is always available for good odds when hes up against goliath  so up against  goliaths means hes available at really good odds it would be completely understandable to see fonar corp available at low multiples if it were actually competing with these  big players in the mri space but thanks to this completely unique and patentprotected product fonar is out there alone with a far superior product to anyone else in the industry it may take time for brand recognition to build up and the market to notice the company but management are certainly going about it the right way in may  a former nfl quarterback was treated thanks to the fonar upright mri scanner the product has received a lot of press coverage and this shows an area where the product can be extremely competitive key stakeholders a number of hedge funds and asset management firms own large stakes in fonar this provides added pressure on management to deliver full value to shareholders the track record of these companies particularly the hedge fund renaissance technologies speaks volumes to the potential of this investment opportunity figure  table is my own data from nasdaq competitive analysis fonar corp is a fairly unique company operating in a niche space so it was difficult to perform a meaningful competitive analysis it operates in the advanced medical technology  equipment industry so taking a couple of companies that operate in this industry albeit in separate niche markets gives an initial insight to the relative value of fonr figure  table is my own data from yahoo finance and bloomberg cyberonics nasdaqcybx business model revolves around vns therapy systems im not an expert in medical technology but in its most simplistic description its comparable to the mri business similarly digirad corp nasdaqdrad is involved in diagnostic imaging although not including mri scanners so im using digirad and cyberonics for this first look at peer fundamentals whichever metric you use evebitda pe pb fonar is incredibly cheap due to the difference in the business models it wouldnt make sense to draw a valuation from these comparisons but its an encouraging sign the mri business as mentioned before is dominated by an oligopoly of  big firms that take up a combined market share of  siemens ge philips toshiba and hitachi a snapshot of each of these firms fundamentals is below figure  table is my own data from yahoo finance and bloomberg all  of these companies play in a space far wider than just mri scanners and medical technology so this competitive analysis will be used to get a thumb in the air fair value and not our actual intrinsic value of the stock i find this a useful check since some companies appear cheap on paper but often are in line with industry averages its only when comparing them that you can draw some conclusions figure  chart is my own data from yahoo finance and bloomberg i used some pretty basic statistics to determine which multiples historically have had the strongest relationship with market price regression analysis is great for that  an r value indicates how much of the variation in the data can be explained by the response data without going into the specifics pe and evebitda multiples share a strong positive coefficient with the market price so im weighting each of them equally in generating an implied fair value for fonr shares the pb seems to bear no weight on the market price in this case so im assigning it a  weighting figure  table is my own data from yahoo finance and bloomberg fonar shares will never trade at the same multiples as those of ge or siemens for numerous reasons small market cap niche market and small market share for example so the implied share price of  is overly optimistic i do however believe that due to the patent protection surrounding fonars business and products there is added security here so trading at a  discount to peers simply will not last valuation many key fundamentals point to fonr shares being undervalued the pe of  and evebitda of  are significantly lower than that of competitors its earnings yield of  is better than that of most companies on the nasdaq ford equity research ranks it in the top  of equities and fonars roc although falling is still greater than  as is the roa consistently around the  mark however you look at this company it appears cheap and well managed figure  table is my own data from yahoo finance and bloomberg fonrs evebitda multiple had been increasing for  years to a high of over  before falling to the current levels of  the competitive analysis revealed that in the mri market trading with an evebitda multiple of above  is in line with the industry average so i dont believe the price drop had anything to do with a correction which we sometimes see for overvalued companies the shares currently trade at an evebitda multiple of  versus an average of  since fiscal yearend  based on this average the intrinsic value of a share in fonar is   a premium of  to the current share price and i believe a fair value for fonar corp which provides a good margin of safety for this investment it is worth noting here that fonars earnings yield is very high and consistent sales were down last year but its earnings remained strong i assume a few factors here in order to come up with a rough forward valuation earnings yield  for the next  fiscal years this is still below the average so i think relatively conservative and would imply fonr shares trade at a forward  pe of  ebitda growth of  for fy and  for fy again conservatively below the historical average as well as being below analyst estimates but this implies an evebitda ratio for fy of  equal weighting to each of these forward values prices fonr shares at  representing an roi of  in  years i estimate each of these valuations to be conservative because for a small cap company like this growth is hard to predict it wouldnt be a surprise to see this firm grow faster than expected and exceed these values entry point as a fundamental analyst i believe the market is semistrong form efficient and therefore i dont use technical analysis as a technique to beat the market i do however realize that technical analysis can offer good insights into the shortterm momentum of price swings so there are one or two indicators i look at when determining an entry point the relative strength index rsi shows investors when a stock is overbought and therefore potentially overvalued or oversold and therefore potentially undervalued in this case the rsi moved below  generally the mark where we say the stock is oversold so in the short term im expecting a rebound in price now could be a good time to initiate a position or add to a position figure  data from recognia its worth noting that the rsi has previously been a good indicator of shortterm performance for fonar shares in december  the stock became oversold and the share price rose more than  until february  in february and march  the stock became overbought and the price then fell around  its not flawless and i wont allow it to change my view on the long term value of fonar but its a good sign of an entry point mitigating the risks any small cap stock carries with it the additional risk of volatility illiquidity and uncertainty the normal risks of a small market cap are somewhat mitigated here by the fact that the company has a track record of consistent earnings and revenue growth and that its products are patentprotected to ensure minimal competition in its niche market an obvious risk that stands out is that fonar is pretty much completely reliant on one man damadian owns around  of the voting shares and is probably responsible for the innovation and manufacture of the upright mri scanner there would probably be a negative reaction if he decided to leave the firm or retire and who knows if the company could be as effective and innovative if he left this risk is tough to quantify and tough to mitigate i take some comfort from the fact that rd costs are increasing again figure  data from tmx money an additional risk is the slowing or stopping of growth the company does currently have a deficit of m in retained earnings on its books which is offset by the m in paidin capital although the m in cash and additional m in receivables make the balance sheet appear healthy the large deficit is a concern that could limit future growth the cash on hand is all that is available for marketing or product development for example management is clearly aware of this risk and as the company continues to be profitable as it has over the last  years the deficit is decreasing although its likely to remain on the books for some time preventing among other things dividends to shareholders figure  data from tmx money as you can see its being repaid but repaid slowly this is likely part of the reason for fonr shares undervaluation due to the companys aggressive growth over the last  years and the possibilities of higher growth to come i do not believe this risk justifies the huge discount fonr shares are trading at currently but it will be a key trend to keep an eye on in coming quarterly results possible catalysts future earnings announcements after the drop in sales last year investors lost some confidence in the company but management remained undeterred by this even when sales revenue took a large hit revenue from hmca and other areas of the business kept fonar profitable as these areas continue to grow fonar revenue will reflect their progress mri sales are inconsistent so a good quarter or year may lead to a surprise earnings beat and a jump in price over the long term i think consistent growth will be seen and i look forward to being able to analyze sales over a longer time frame particularly when fonar becomes profitable fonar this product has the potential to shake up the industry and get fonar some serious brand recognition the knockon effects of a large product can lead to a jump in market price which is a possibility with fonar acquisition since fonar corp has created such strong patent protection it wouldnt be a surprise if one of the big players in the mri market realised that the only way to compete with the advancements in xray and gamma technology is to bring fonar products to the mass market the extensive patent protection would mean the only way this could be done is for one of the larger mri firms to buy out the company personally i would think an attempt is very likely in the future particularly when fonar is generating revenue its hard to judge how likely it would be for such an attempt to succeed since almost  of the voting power belongs to the firms founder and ceo raymond v damadian disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in fonr over the next  hours i wrote this article myself and

uprightÂ® mri to scan you in the position you experience your problemâsitting standing bending leaning as well as lying down all other mris can only scan you while youâre lying down  scanning with the weight of your body on your spine and other joints the uprightâ¢ mri allows all parts of the body to be imaged with the normal weight of your body on the spine and other jointsâan advantage that leads to a more accurate diagnosis imaging your spine when it is fully loaded with the weight of your body as compared to unloaded in a conventional lieâdown mri is critical to an accurate diagnosis as you can see by the following images many back problems are âmissedâ when the spine is not bearing the weight of the body and not imaged in the positions the spine normally occupies a

prestigious ucla school of medicine recently did a study that reveals the âmiss rateâ of static mri compared to patient problems detected with dynamicâ¢ mri the study was done using the fonar uprightÂ® multipositionâ¢ mri landmark study by ucla school of medicine of over  patients  quantifies the miss rate of static mri static mri is defined by ucla as being scanned in one position sitting straight up it does not include being scanned in multiple positions such as flexion bending forward extension bending backward lateral bending or rotation the findings could substantially

the condition that on or before may   the company must have evidenced a closing bid price of  or more for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days the panelâs decision was based on its determination that the reverse stock split to be presented at the annual meeting on april   when implemented would be likely to cure the bid price deficiency and allow the company to maintain compliance for the longer term following the reverse stock split the nasdaq listing qualifications panel found the company to be in full compliance with its listing requirements including its share price and the postsplit price performance of fonar shares site map  terms of useour privacy policy use copyright Å¡  fonar all rights reserved
