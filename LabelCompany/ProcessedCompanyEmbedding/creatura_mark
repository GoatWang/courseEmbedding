on the lake creatura is made with  different mechanisms the rotating paddles the human wheel and the cycling paddles without any directional bar the children had to cooperate to follow a specific track coordinated by the capitan who is on the tower to see outside the rotating paddles is a set of two side mounted paddles with a central metal handle accessible from the interior of the creatura a simple rotation of the handle activates the paddles the human wheel is a rotating wheel with a radius of  meters with  stepping divisions the motion of walking on the steps activate the rotation of the wheel and move the creatura forward the cycling paddles is made of recycled bicycle frames and pedals connected to the paddles in the water foot pedalling motion activates the paddles federico

builders with this in mind the project was constructed with prefabricated kit of parts and the construction process last only  weeks main structural parts consist of laminated plywood ribs as the primary structure and x timber deck frame as the floating raft combined with  plastic barrels the cladding of the frame is in thin strips of western red cedar which were easily bent into shape in situ
