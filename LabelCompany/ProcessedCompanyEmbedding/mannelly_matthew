matthew m mannelly ceo of prestige brands in irvington management secrets of top westchester ceos matthew m mannelly ceo of prestige brands in irvington   “i hate consensus” declares matthew m mannelly  ceo of prestige brands “we’re not here to build consensus if we build consensus it will take us forever” the impatient ceo of the fastgrowing consumer products company says he prefers collaboration “when you collaborate” he explains “you gather the points of view of everyone then whoever is the right decision maker makes the decision get the right people collaborating and you’ll come up with the right answer” there have been plenty of right answers for prestige since mannelly came on board in  sales that year were under  million after divesting a few lagging products repositioning others and making some substantial acquisitions sales for the  fiscal year are projected to exceed  million from products like chloraseptic compound w efferdent pediacare dramamine and newly acquired brands like beano ecotrin tagamet and sominex the company outsources manufacturing but does all product development marketing and sales inhouse with a person staff soon to be larger in irvington “we have kind of a plugandplay model when we bring a brand into the company” mannelly says “that’s not to say we don’t learn something new with every acquisition once you think you know everything you should quit” mannelly also condemns the bschool dogma that says mature brands should not be promoted just milked for cash “there is always a new better or different way to grow your business” he says “for a brand like chloraseptic you can introduce a new flavor a new bottle or a new dispenser you take your cues from the consumer on how to improve the brand” as this article was going to press mannelly faced an unexpected challenge genomma lab internacional based in mexico made an unsolicited takeover offer for prestige which in turn promptly adopted a poison pill defense
