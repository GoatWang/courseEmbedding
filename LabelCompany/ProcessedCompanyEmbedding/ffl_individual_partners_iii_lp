personal gun purchase jul  by brandon maddoxin ffl ffl blog  commentsffl license personal useone of the biggest perks of having your own ffl license is being able to order firearms for personal use at much reduced prices however once you become a ffl dealer it’s important that you keep track of your personal collection in the proper fashionstarting with before you actually get your ffl license go through your collection and decide if there is anything you’d like to sell you’ll need to enter anything you might want to sell into your acquisitions  dispositions ad book once you get one obviously this is not required to move personal inventory to your ffl books but a good best practice before you sell a “personal” firearm after getting an fflafter you get your ffl license and you decide to purchase a gun for your personal collection you’ll need to enter it into your ad book upon its arrival to your ffl licensed location then you can mark the gun out of your records as a disposition to yourself and no  is required you’ll want to be sure to keep your personal collection separate from your inventory either by storing them separately from your inventory or by labeling your personal collection as “not for sale” with a tagif after a couple of months you decide you don’t like the new gun you transferred to yourself and want to resell it you’ll need to put it back into your ad book and sell it through your ffl any gun you’ve had in your personal collection less than a year will need to be sold through your license if you choose to sell it for guns that have been in your collection for over a year you may sell in a private sale as long as you keep a record of the date of that sale in a bound record and make note of the make model serial number and caliber of the weapon you’ll also need to record the name address and date of birth of the purchaser and the purchaser will also need to be identified in any manner in which you’d identify a purchaser through a commercial sale eg a driver’s license if the private sale is to another licensee the name and address of the licensee will need to be recorded however most ffl holders choose to sell everything through their ffl and perform a background check to ensure that the purchaser is legally able to own a firearm it’s about as much paperwork to do it one way as to do it the other so many ffl dealers hold the opinion that they may as well run the background check while they’re at ita note should be made that this procedure is applicable to sole proprietor ffl licensees only meaning ffl holders who applied as an individual and not a llc corporation partnership etc different rules apply to the situations of llcs and partnershipsto learn how to become a ffl dealer and for more information on
