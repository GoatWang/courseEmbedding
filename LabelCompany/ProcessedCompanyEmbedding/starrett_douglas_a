holds one of the companys electronic micrometersto lead with precisiondouglas a starrett carries on a family traditionclick here to view timeline douglas a starrett may run a large global business representing more than  million in annual sales but his management style and demeanor is more akin to a manager of a small person officeas he walks the snaking halls of ls starrett cos monstrous squarefoot headquarters in athol he greets employees by name many employees  some whove worked at the company producing precision measuring tools for more than  years  stop to chat and to gently chide the boss about his recent decision to shave off his beard his annual letter to employees and retirees contains as much in the way of business updates as it does downtoearth charm  including the score from the thanksgiving day athol football gamehes equally at home setting up operations in some farflung location halfway around the globe as he is approving name tags for a semiannual employee meetingweve got a big breadth and scope but i like to think we operate as a small business doug starrett saidtraditionls starrett got its start when its founder laroy s starrett first produced the now ubiquitous tool known as the combination square in  today the company makes in excess of  items including everything from tape measures to saw blades to electronic micrometers starrett is the fourth member of his family to run the company he took the helm from his father douglas r starrett in doug is following in his fathers footsteps said richard kennedy a member of ls starretts board of directors and president and ceo of the worcester regional chamber of commerce hes a fine executive and really a good friendkennedy described doug starrett as a handson executive who learned the business from the ground up he knows every aspect of the businessas a teenager doug starrett worked as an errand boy in the companys micrometer department after graduating from miami university of ohio with a degree in business administration he worked in the construction industry in boston but he returned to the company in  and more than  years later is still walking the halls of the companys athol plant between trips to the companys overseas operations while the company bears his namesake as a publicly traded firm starrett has no birthright to run the company instead he has served for the last six years at the wishes of the boardsoon after doug starrett was named president and ceo in  his father died unexpectedly of a stroke at almost the same time the nation spun into a recession in the wake of the terrorist attacks on doug had to take over at a time when the market was changing dramatically and he responded very effectively kennedy saidnew avenueskennedy said the old way of doing business at ls starrett had been to rely largely on brand loyalty which meant customers felt okay about paying more for a starrett product because they knew the product would be of high quality but over the last several years pricing pressures have meant ls starrett has to be more creative in the way it markets its products and how it produces them in some cases thats meant moving production to lower costs or outsourcing some work for example ls starrett had been doing its injection molding in house for some of its products but it recently began outsourcing plastic work to a company in the dominican republic near the companys plant therekennedy also said doug starrett has recognized new opportunities in the marketplace like new channels of distribution that are now availablefor fiscal year  which ended june  ls starrett reported net sales of more than  million an  percent increase over the previous year the company was also profitable this year reporting nearly  million in net earnings thats welcome news after several tough years between  and doug starrett demurs any credit for the companys success both globally and in athol instead crediting the legions of people that have worked here over the past  yearsls starrett has been a global concern since the s when it established operations in brazil and scotland in  the company with doug starretts help established both distribution and manufacturing in china but now doug starrett has his eyes on the middle east after recently returning from the oilrich middle eastern nation of dubai which is undergoing an astounding amount of growth the company is poised to benefit from the increase in construction therecompetitive pressuresstarrett isnt shy about his opinions on the difficulties facing americanbased manufacturers like ls starrett hes plainly critical when it comes to sarbanesoxley the strict accounting rules put into place in the earlier part of the decade in the wake of the enron and worldcom scandals theres not a customer out there willing to pay a dime more because were sarbanesoxley compliant he saidhes equally critical of the mounting costs facing businesses in massachusetts including unemployment insurancewhile the companys local employment is markedly less then its peak in the s and s  it hovers today around  down from a high of   the company is still committed to its home base despite cost pressures the company recently invested about  million in a new etching facility at its headquarters that will help with efficiency and cut down on hazardous waste and in a small corner of the building the company is even creating software and assembling circuit boards for the companys line of digital measuring equipment in addition the company is installing a hydroelectric generator in the millers river that runs by its plant the cost of that project is deferred by a  grant from the massachusetts technology collaborative and is expected to be operational in despite the drop in employment over the last three decades ls starrett is still the number one employer in the town of athol and the company  and doug starrett  plays a central role therestarrett is athol and athol is starrett kennedy said even the towns ymca is intertwined with the company  its located at the site of the shop where ls starrett tools were first producedbut doug starrett has also carried on his familys tradition of community involvement most recently starrett played a key role in developing a strategic plan for the local public school system according to david ames athols town managerdoug took it upon himself to take a leadership role and worked closely with a lot of the members of the school committee ames said because of that everything went very smoothlydoug starrett and the company have done a lot for the schools and for the town ames said when he feels its a good cause hes definitely willing to donate ames addeddoug starrett has also led the company in several acquisitions the most recent of which was a deal to buy a person california firm called kinemetric engineering which will help bolster ls starretts camerabased inspection line which is a far cry from the more traditional precision measuring instruments that the company is most wellknow forbut as doug starrett puts it were not in the tool business we are in the business of providing measuring solutions and in the st century that means producing electronic tags that transmit measurements from shop floors to centralized computers as well as calipers and gageswhile the variety of products offered by ls starrett has expanded dramatically since the companys founding one thing has remained consistent according to kennedythey have a very very excellent reputation and great brand awareness that theyve built up through a following thats worldwide he said thats really a credit to the starrett family and doug whos carried that on print email order a pdf related content proposal would demolish church

given  likes received  i sent an email to starrett exposing my disdain with chinese made tools  here is his reply your email just made it to my desk and i wanted to respond to you on this subject i thoroughly enjoyed reading your letter and i mean that in all sincerity i certainly share your sentiments but unfortunately people like you and me are fewer and farther between than ever before there is no one in our industry that is a stronger believer than the starrett company on the importance of keeping a manufacturing base in the usa we have been fortunate to successfully compete against foreign manufacturers of precision instruments and to this day still  of what we make is made here in the usa the reality of the situation is we have seen a steady erosion of our precision tool business over the past three years fewer people in the industry are willing to pay a premium price for american made topquality measuring tools from starrett and i�m not going to sit here and watch the company bleed a slow death as the manufacturing base in the us slowly erodes in  we opened a small factory in china to expand our presence in china and to protect our brand from predatory pricing from china as my granddad used to say �there�s nothing like giving your competitors a little heartburn in their own backyard� the starrett exact� line of imported precision measuring tools including dial calipers are being introduced to the us market to give the end user a choice of highquality tools from starrett made to our standards and backed by our service and support the customer still has the choice of purchasing an american made product if they chose to do so this line of tools is a very limited offering at the present time and no one is more concerned than i am about the longterm ramifications of this move we are not willing to throw out our reputation of highquality madeintheusa products now if you can educate me on how we can convert more end users to american made products with the same enthusiasm as you have then i�m all ears we are always looking for good salesmen who can sell the advantage and the merits of american made products at premium prices maybe you ought to

to your garage install a garage door opener it makes it easy to get into or out of your garage without getting out of your vehicle thanks to an included remote control you can also go out the garage

via a wireless keypad system work benchesbecause you may be working on various projects in your garage you might want to invest in a workbench too many of these workbenches have wood tops with either drawers or open storage space underneath to conveniently house your most used tools some workbenches double as sawhorses that have vises attached and allow you to work on projects without holding down the items with your hands some workbenches have high backs so you can attach pegboard to hang small tools and other items from itgarage cabinets and storageif you need additional storage for items that you want to keep behind closed doors consider either freestanding cabinets or wallmounted cabinets these cabinets can have as many as six shelves and feature one or two sections some of the freestanding units have casters on the bottom and allow you to move them about freely some units have both drawer and cabinet space if you need to store small tools and larger tools or other items at the same time the heights on these units range from less than  inches to as much as  inches or more the widths range from around  inches to more than  inches this variety lets you choose whats best for your needsgarage shelvingif enclosed storage isnt what you want there are several varieties of open shelving units from which you can choose most of these feature two to five shelves with some

of your tools is with a tool box to tool chest or by placing them on a pegboard on a wall of the garage tool boxes for the most part are portable and allow you to carry your essential tools and related items think nails screws and other fasteners to a job site or whenever you might need quick access to them tool boxes usually have a top that opens and two or three drawers that slide out the top is secured with clasps that flip closed there are also tool bags that work like a tool box but look like a duffel bag for added portability we have some tool boxes that resemble luggage and even have wheels that allow you to pull or push them alongfor working at home or long term on a job site a tool chest is more suitable these have much more space and allow you to store many more tools these tool boxes have a top that opens have anywhere from two to eight drawers and sometimes have open storage space on the bottom ideal for power tools although some of these chests are stationary most of them have casters and allow you to have access to them wherever youre working many of these chests are metal but some are rigid plastic or aluminum too red and black are common colors but there are other colors available including some that are twotone another feature of tool chests is that theyre more secure because you can lock them with a keyshow moreelectrode comp dcproddfw
