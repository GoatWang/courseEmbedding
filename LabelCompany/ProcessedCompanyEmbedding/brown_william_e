thawerdescription a fullservice family and employment based immigration law firmquote “clients come to us for only one reason to win their case”striving for the will to winthe volatile immigration landscape in the us invites enormous reforms with every changing usadministration president obama for instance has made numerous changes in immigrationbringing positive conclusions to the key issues encountered by the us immigrant community including undocumented alienism lack of work permits insurances driver licenses and green card statuses excited to be a part of this shifting landscape is sherin thawer a business litigation lawyer and immigration expert from texasthe lone star statethawer started the law offices of sherin thawer  associates back in  to bring her business litigation expertise to the immigration field “my law firm was initially formed to offer business litigation services but i began to be more involved in immigration cases and  years later i’m knee deep in immigration practice and committed to helping different individuals with their immigration issues” says thawer currently sherin thawer  associates the fullservice immigration firm handles cases that range from family and employment based immigration cases to deportation and removal proceedingssherin thawer agrees that the immigration reforms brought by president obama have mainly be of an assistance the south asian community through the president’s deferred actions for childhood arrivals daca thawer’s law firm has been able to help a lot of adolescent individuals in conquering their dreams such as attending colleges obtaining their driver’s licenses and being able to gain authorized employment authorizations in the united states “most of the south asian children who came to the states as minors are struggling to obtain status here because either their parents do not have a green card status or their cases are messed up this is really unfair for them but through daca these children don’t have to face any restrictions to obtain the best of education and employment in the us” notes thawerwith its headquarters in irving texassherin thawer  associates not only has a strong local presence but also a global stand through teleconferences and emails the firm helps many people hailing from countries like india dubai afghanistan iran iraq and many others even though the attorneys are not afforded to personally acquaint many clients they are able to assist them in their immigration cases “clients come to us for only one reason to win the case in the end they do not want to hear anything else thus as an attorney it is very important for me to make sure my case is perfectly handled before it goes to trial” says thawerthe law firm’s success stories can be briefed in a case study which involved a labased guajarati family who has been struggling to obtain their green card status for almost  years initially the family filed for asylum through a local attorney that produced no result subsequent to multiple appeals in immigration court the family got stuck at the circuit court where their case remained pending for years finally when they approached sherin thawer  associates thawer proposed a specifically carved out solution involving an appeal for a deportation termination same has enabled the case to attain a successful closure bringing the legal permanent residency status to the entire familygoing forward sherin thawer associates aims to stand by their motto ‘will to win’ to attain successful results in each and every client’s case at the end of the day sherin thawer looks forward to one thing—to apply the law in a way which only provides for the best possible solutionsherin thawer law officerinna s ratedlaw offices of sherin thawer pcby mariola michalska associate attorneyis a recession good time for a divorce  in the times of recession many couples are suffering from the consequences of flawed financial decisions or because of overall economics in the country but can the recession be a good time in which to bring divorce proceedings absolutelytheres the attorneys theory that money provides the soft fatty tissue that insulates the marital skeleton once its cut back and people get a good look at the guts of their relationship they want out and theres the marriagecounselor theory that couples who were never quite on the same page in the checkbook finally get pushed off the ledger by endless arguing over their declining resources and the therapist theory that financial worries cause stress stress can cause depression etcin a normal economy couples typically build equity in their homes then divide that equity in a divorce either after selling the house or with one partner buying out the other’s share but after the recent boomandbust cycle more couples own houses that neither spouse can afford to maintain and that they cannot sell for what they owe for couples already under stress the family home has become a toxic assetfor the majority of the population the principal marital assets the k and the marital home have lost much of their value without equity in the marital home and encumbered by substantial credit card debt the parties are left to fight about who gets stuck paying the bills in some cases unable to distribute the debt or sell the marital home the estranged spouses are forced to become adverse roommates however the recession affects the upper and middle classes differently for the welltodo the recession offers an opportunity to end the marriage at bargain basement prices as property will be distributed at lower valuations if you are a business owner a low valuation of assets will be in your favor in a divorce if you the owner of a business and the business is a very substantial asset of the marriage in a recession the values of most assets decrease the fair market value of a business is determined by the price someone is willing to pay in a bona fide arms length transaction in a recession there is a lack of faith in the economy overall even if the business is sound it may be valued substantially lower during a recession than its value during good economic times it is usual in divorce cases that the owner of the business will be awarded the business after it has been appraised and the other spouse will be given assets or cash to offset the value of the business thus in a recession the payout figure to the other spouse for the business should be less than during good times and the advantage to the business owner is that after the recession the value of the business should rise againthe law offices of sherin thawer pc is a general practice law firm that is ready to help you during difficult times we handle family law business law and immigration

us are facing many difficulties they are threatened by job loss due to the current economic crisis that may impact their visa status as well recently we have received numerous inquiries on this subject and would like to share a few with our loyal fun asia listenersduring these times of economic crisis many of our listeners are facing the possibility of losing their jobs those that are working under a nonimmigrant visa status have the added burden of the impact the job loss will have on their current status several listeners have sent us inquiries regarding this issue and we would like to address some of the most common situationswhat happens if i find another hb employer during the time i was laid off as my company informs me that they have sent uscis a letter revoking my hib petition recently it has taken quite some time for uscis to process hb revocation notices this is not to say that this is their policy but it’s due to their system we recommend the hb should try to obtain another job and file the hb transfer petition as soon as possiblecan i apply for an adjustment of status other than hb if i am being laid offan hb employee may be able to apply for another status depending on a persons individual circumstances and the visa’s eligibility requirements viable options may include but not limited to f student status h or f dependent of an hb or f spouse respectively b tourist b business status and eeb investment visas i have recently been laid off and was told that my employer is obligated to continue paying me until uscis revokes the petition is this trueno according to the department of labor policy an employer must continue to pay the hb worker until there is a “bona fide” termination of the employment relationship it is not specified exactly what forms a “bona fide termination” but the common perspective is that termination occurs on the same day the employer notifies the hb employee that the position has been terminated and all requirements for payment of wages terminate on the date of employment termination in conclusion i would like to thank our audience for tuning into our immigration segment on  am every tuesday and

greater chance of risk as compared to the average policy the premium is usually higher premiums are often paid monthly and can add up over time up to be greater than the expense of replacing the insured itemmany types of insurance only cover a certain amount of risk on an item the amount the policyholder must pay before an insurance policy begins covering an expense is called the deductible in the event of damage or loss to whatever the policy covers the policyholder is responsible for the deductible no matter what if the cost of damage or loss is less than the deductible amount the insurance company does not pay anything if the cost is greater than the deductible the policyholder only pays the deductible while the insurance pays the rest generally the deductible amount is related to your premium with a higher deductible usually requiring a lower premium and viceversainsurance agents selecting the right insurance involves careful research and evaluating many different options for coverage this is why many people use an insurance agent to assist with making the right choice depending on their needs and financial situation agents often interview potential or current clients to get an idea of which insurance policies would benefit them the most based on their needs and individual risk agents can often give potential customers a quote which serves as a cost estimate for a specific policy this is only a rough idea of what the policy will cost because evaluating the risk associated with a given customer can take time insurance companies often compile an insurance score to quantify the risk an individual poses and calculate premiums accordingly credit scores play a major role in insurance scores but past insuranceclaim history is also taken into accountwhile agents often specialize in a particular category of insurance some sell several different types of insurance agents can work for a larger insurance company or operate independently selling policies from several different insurersinsurance productsalmost anything of value can be insured to protect against loss due to a variety of circumstances insurance policies are very specific in the items they protect and in what event the policy holders will be reimbursed some of the most common insurance policies cover things we all useautomotive insurance millions of americans drive a car to get from place to place each day so it makes sense that auto insurance is one of the most commonly used types in most states the law requires drivers to maintain an active insurance policy on any car up to a certain amount most car owners are required at minimum to purchase liability insurance which protects against damage for which the policyholder is at fault liability insurance covers damage to property as well as any injuries sustained in an accident its important to note liability insurance only covers damage or injuries of others not the policyholder themselves in addition to liability insurance car owners can also purchase coverage for their own vehicle and medical expenses in the event of an accident for this purpose liability vehicle and medical coverage are often packaged together in a single policyinsurance can also be purchased for other vehicles like motorcycles atvs boats or rvs and generally functions similarly to car insurance policies for alternative vehicles may have higher premiums if they are considered more dangerous or might include other coverage options specific to the vehicle many companies that provide auto insurance will also offer coverage for motorcycles atvs boats and rvshomeowners insurance your home condo or apartment is probably the most valuable thing you own or otherwise pay for so it makes sense to get it insured homeowners insurance is important not just for the security of the house itself but for its ability to cover possessions inside the home as well many mortgage lenders also require an active home insurance policylike auto insurance homeowners insurance is typically bundled together with policies covering many different items or categories of items the primary coverage type is for the dwelling insuring the house itself and all structures attached to it policies may also cover property within the home with premiums varying depending on the value of all assets personal liability may also be included for damage or injuries sustained on your property that you are responsible for much like auto insuranceproperty insurance also may cover certain major events outside of your control these are known as perils and may include fire flooding natural disasters and other catastrophic events you may want to purchase insurance against one or more of these perils if you live in a highrisk area flood insurance is an exception however and can be purchased through the governmentsponsored national flood insurance program your lender may require this if you live in a floodprone areahealth insurance to help pay for medical expenses many people rely on their health insurance with the passing of the affordable care act almost every american is required to enroll in a health care plan or they face a penalty health insurance works similarly to other forms of insurance although it is probably used to cover expenses more often since car accidents and home damage are relatively rare compared to doctor visits and the need for medicine health insurance also operates on a premiumdeductible model and policyholders can choose what level of coverage works best for their lifestyle for example if you visit doctors very infrequently you may consider a plan with a low premium and a higher deductible on the other hand people who require regular medical care may wish to pay a higher premium in exchange for more coverage from their deductible dental and vision care are sold as separate plans and are not required by lawlife insurance when someone dies unexpectedly or is injured severely enough to be unable to work it can be a financial disaster for their family or loved ones many people choose to purchase a life insurance policy to support their family in the event their regular income is suddenly lost life insurance comes in two basic types term and universal with a term life insurance plan you pay a premium for a predetermined amount of time usually  years or more if you die at any point in that timeframe your family receives a death benefit if youre still around when the term is over the coverage is canceled and you receive nothing universal life covers your entire life and usually delivers a minimum benefit at deathtravel insurance travel insurance is available for individuals who want to protect against unexpected setbacks in the course of travel whether its losing luggage or medical treatment abroad travel insurance may prove particularly useful for people who travel a lot for work or often visit remote locations travel insurance can take the form of either specific or blanket coverage specific coverage is useful for covering only certain risks like medical emergencies or unexpected trip cancelation blanket coverage may cover some or all of your expenses for your entire trippet insurance pet insurance is a relatively new product that may help cover the costs of medical care for a dog cat or other domestic animal medical care for animals can be very costly particularly because insurance for them is rare by paying into a premium you can help offset the cost of unexpected emergencies as well as routine checkups and medication while virtually unheard of a few years ago pet insurance has become more popular as the cost of veterinarian care has continued to riseumbrella insurance umbrella insurance is extra coverage from liability for other insurance policies usually home or auto insurance consumers may choose to purchase an umbrella policy if their home or car is more expensive than a typical policy would be able to cover for example most car insurance liability policies cover at least  per person or  per accident but if the accident involves a very valuable car or the victim is willing to pursue legal action insurance may not even begin to cover the full cost you may want to hedge your risk by purchasing umbrella insurance to add extra protection to your existing policyinsurance claims basicsto receive a payout for an insurance policy the policyholder must file a claim with the insurance company the basics of the process are straightforward but can vary depending on the type of insuranceclaims adjusters and examiners a claims adjuster or claims examiner is an employee of an insurance company and the person responsible for evaluating claims and determining if the company will reimburse the policyholder at the amount provided an adjuster inspects claims related to property damage as in the case of auto or home insurance policies claims examiners are typically involved in health and life insurance and review medical records to determine the proper payout for major medical procedureshow to make a claim filing an insurance claim can be stressful and confusing but you need to begin the process as soon as possible to make certain you can recover your losses its important to note that in the case of emergencies you should always call  first the safety and health of yourself and others takes precedent over insuranceauto insurance claim if youre involved in an accident you need to call the police right away and have them document the situation you can file a claim upon obtaining the police report its also a good idea if possible to take your own notes at the scene the most important things to record are what happened before the accident the date and time traffic signs in the area and road conditions also be sure to get the other drivers name address license plate number and insurance information even photos taken with a cell phone camera can help the claims process once you have this documentation call your insurance company right away homeowners insurance claim in the case of damage take pictures of the affected area as soon as any safety or health emergencies are resolved take note of what happened and all the relevant circumstances and report to your insurer as soon as possible if any of your possessions were damaged use an inventory of your important assets and make note of this in the claim once an adjuster has made their own report review it for accuracy life insurance claim send your insurer a claim form for each beneficiary in the plan as well as a certified copy of the policyholders death certificate with the proper information life insurance claims are generally straightforward problems may arise if the policyholder has died within two years of opening the policy in this case an attorney may be needed to settle the claimfinding discounts on insuranceinsurance is a wise investment but it can make a dent in your monthly budget thankfully there are a variety of ways to trim the fat off your premiums and make certain you are paying only as much as you needshop and compare perhaps the best way to save on any insurance policy is to take the time to compare prices between as many companies and plans as possible even after youve chosen a plan and started paying into it consider looking around again when it comes time to renew the policy consider using an independent agent when searching for a new insurance policy while traditional agents can still find a good deal independent agents can choose from a variety of providers and tailor your coverage to your specific needs the internet has also made comparison shopping easier than ever before potential customers can often get free quotes online very quicklybuy only what you need insurance agents will often try to upsell on various extra products that may be useful for certain people but are generally excessive for the average consumer stick with basic plans that cover as much as you need without any additional costs for example if the annual cost of your auto insurance is  percent or more of the total value of your car drop all but the most essential coverage this is especially applicable if the car you drive is older and could be replaced with savings otherwise you are paying for insurance that will never actually benefit you in the event of a serious crash it can help to create a budget and know exactly how much income you have to work with before making a decision on a new policytake advantage of discounts insurance providers offer a wide variety of discounts for all kinds of special customers or circumstances in one of the most basic discounts many companies will offer lower rates for customers who purchase home auto and life insurance policies from the same provider car owners may get a rebate from taking a safe driving course for those with teenagers on their plan good grades can earn a small discount as well insuring multiple cars with the same provider may also lower premiums some providers will offer lower rates for military personnel federal employees teachers first responders and their families we just redesigned ypcom do you
