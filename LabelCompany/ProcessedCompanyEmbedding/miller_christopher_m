designclear displaykeeps good timereliableconspoor workmanshipbest usesdecorationcomments about howard miller christopher mantel clock  very attractive clock but my husband had to repair it before we used it the face and hands were loose  the hole in the center for the hands to attach to the works was way to big the works almost fell out as the screws were loose after  weeks the chimes stopped we thought it might be the batteries so we changed them no luck then my husband a retired mechanic spotted a wire on the chiming mechanism that was loose he fixed that and it works fine the quality of the parts are good but the overall quality control is very poorprimary usepersonalbottom line no i would not recommend this to a friend of  customers found this review helpfulwas this review

inappropriate jill williamson oregon age  gender female  stars out of  october   jill williamson oregon age  gender female hunter and his friends play the ultimate prank on the school bully they hide in a dumpster to avoid his wrath but cant get out after yelling for help for quite some time someone finally comes to their aid this janitor promises not to tell the school principal where he found the boys if theyll do him a favor he hands hunter a card with the address of a book shop and asks him to pick up an item and bring it back to the boys bathroom feeling as if they have no choice the boys complete the errand but when they return to the bathroom with a fancy old book and a key the janitor is nowhere to be foundhunter takes the things home and discovers that the book is magical before he can truly figure out what the book is for he and his friend are whisked away to solandria a realm that is at war with the shadow there hunter discovers that he must complete codebearer training if he is to help defeat this shadow and get home again with dragons trolls giant birds and lizards and weapons similar to light sabers this book was truly fun for all ages i thought the premise and allegory was very powerful hunter is a delightful and sarcastic character the minor characters were also fun this was the strength of the book in my opinion there were some unnecessary backflashes that jerked me out of the story at times and some writing craft issues that teens probably wont notice there were also many punctuation issues i was surprised to see such mistakes in a book from warner press i read it to my sevenyearold son and he loved it especially the illustrations the miller brothers seem to be quite talented as artists and animators and now story tellers was
