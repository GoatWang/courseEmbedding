women alike would love as a successful entrepreneur working as an onair host and pitch woman in the as seen on tv industry she began exploring solutions that would work and wanted to introduce the product in a commercial she would produce but how do you develop and configure a product with the features and benefits that would appeal to a broad market the solution it was at the housewares show when we initially sat down with her to explore her concept within a week our designers ordered nearly every hair product being sold on the market getting immersed in the industry and testing what worked and what didn’t on the female staff members in our office then working in concert with ms baldwin our designers sketched numerous solutions and began crude prototyping to test the various ways the product could be constructed  finally taylor and our designers were able to select the best embodiment to be sold on television and enhance completed prototyping to be used in the commercial test the good news is the product has been a hit and we are delighted to be a part of making this product a success the results day turnaround patentable features million units sold amazing result hot buns
