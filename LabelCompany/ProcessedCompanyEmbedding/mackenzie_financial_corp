mackenzie’s parent company power financial corp invested million in wealthsimple financial inc a roboadviser platform that builds automated online portfolios exclusively using etfsmackenzie offers approximately  mutual funds with billion in total assets under management but it does not offer etfs‘we are intrigued by this space but we need to understand how we can add value to that space before we can step into it” jeff carney ceo of mackenzie said in an interviewmackenzie will not consider offering traditional etfs but will explore those products using active management said mr carneytraditional etfs mimic an index whereas actively managed funds have a portfolio manager overseeing asset allocations active etfs make up approximately billion of the billion in etf assets under management in canada according to investor economics“in the active space it is up to your creativity” said mr carney “there are quantitative things going on in that space and we see some of the competitors in that space using traditional management skills if we were to play in that space we would be taking advantage of our investment skills at mackenzie to explore opportunities”horizons etfs management canada inc is one of the largest actively manged etf providers in canada with billion in actively managed assets the company first launched an actively managed etf in  and now has  actively manged funds on its platform“we think actively managed etfs will continue to be one of the fastestgrowing areas of etfs in canada” said howard atkinson president of horizons “a new entrant in the actively managed etf space would help legitimize that industry once competition enters the market fees usually compress and innovation increases bringing more choice to the end investor”mr cooke is a wellknown etf veteran and his move to mackenzie has raised eyebrows in the industry“this speaks to a rapidly shifting industry” said yves rebetez managing director of consulting firm etf insight “clearly the etf industry is not going to continue to grow at a rapid pace without there being any response on the part of the mutual fund industry”the banking sector has already entered the etf space with bank of montreal and royal bank of canada both launching etf platforms in  other banks could also eventually have their own offerings said mr rebetezother players including both mutual fund and insurance companies could enter the market if etf sales are open to include mutual fund advisers an initiative currently being driven by the canadian etf association cetfa“i have felt for a long time now that it was inevitable that major asset managers would start looking at this space” says mr atkinson who is also chairman of cetfa “i think it is more a question of when not if whether it be banks fund companies or insurance companies one day they will all have an etf offering” report typoerror follow clare o’hara on twitter oharaclare   more related to this story dividend etfs a great idea but
