above at company headquarters in irvine joined the fastfood chain in  as its chief marketing and innovation officer from the beginning he said he thought it was a brand with a “youthful spirit that was ripe to unlock” mark boster  los angeles times samantha masunagacontact reporter the gig since jan  brian niccol has been chief executive of taco bell corp the irvinebased fastfood chain known for menu creations such as doritos locos tacos and crunchwrap supremes since the first restaurant opened in  in downey taco bell has expanded to about  locations and  employees nationwidefirst business niccol  learned some of his earliest lessons while running a lawnmowing business as a teenager with some friends the group would get contracts to mow lawns that included residential yards and office park expanses early on he learned that pricing varied by location and to get a contract marketing was a must niccol would take this idea with him to future jobs at the time you do it you dont realize how its influencing you going forward he said i think it carries on with you in the subconscioustech savvy technology changed rapidly in the early to mids while niccol attended ohios miami university during his freshman year he used a brother word processor by his senior year he had an email address and could make a website the quickly evolving tools made an impression on him and eventually played a major role at each of his companies technology if it provides a service and can solve the stress points or anxiety points people will adopt it in a big way niccol saidfresh take after graduating from college in  with an engineering degree niccol took a job at procter  gamble co to work in brand management one of his more memorable projects was a scope mouthwash campaign to send an animated kiss via email — something that had never been done from that campaign he said he learned the necessity of taking risks to keep brands young and relevant what ive always seen is the brands that have a youthful mindset a youthful vigor they have a great value proposition he said while working at procter  gamble niccol earned an mba from the university of chicago the pizza business in  niccol moved to yum brands the parent company of taco bell pizza hut and kfc two years later he was named chief marketing officer of pizza hut and eventually rose to general manager for pizza hut usa at the time the company was mulling the idea of selling pizzas online something done only by a company in new zealand niccol thought online ordering had two big benefits — convenience and accuracy — and decided to try it out today all the big pizza companies are huge in the online space he said it just shows the power of technologyforever young niccol joined taco bell in  as its chief marketing and innovation officer from the beginning he said he thought it was a brand with a youthful spirit that was ripe to unlock he started by changing the companys slogan from think outside the bun to live mas just by changing a few words the company repositioned itself from food is fuel to food is an experience which has since been a rallying cry for innovation he said from there he improved taco bells digital marketing and the budget increased from  million when he started at the company to  million todaywith items such as the quesarito and xxl grilled stuft burritos as well as the addition of breakfast foods to the menu the company has gained a reputation for attracting millennials — a profitable demographic craved by many fastfood chains if you let the brand get old you will die niccol said that means you deliver experiences that really matter to the current generationfavorite food of all the menu items niccols favorite is the cheesy gordita crunch a flatbread slathered in cheese and wrapped around a crunchy taco he usually orders two its got everything thats great about taco bell niccol said it has cheesy beefy crunchy its melted its just awesome whats next niccol said the company would continue to innovate and plans to release new products including the quesalupa and capn crunch delights which he described as cereal in a doughnut hole the company also plans to launch a loyalty program and get into the delivery space youll see the taco bell brand starting to evolve even in the restaurants we build he said we want to be accessible to everybody whether youre in an urban or suburban worldfamily fans niccol lives in newport beach with jennifer his wife of  years and their three children ages   and  he said its too early to tell whether any of them will follow him into the food industry though his yearold son loves chicken quesaritos i think they all have a very creative spirit niccol said if youve got a creative spirit it definitely is a great place to find
