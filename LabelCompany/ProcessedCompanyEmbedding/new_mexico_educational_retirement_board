social security calculator downloadable forms useful websites calendar retirement planning sitemap nmerb history now  then today the new mexico educational retirement board nmerb is an organization of approximately  active members  inactive members and  retirees the nmerb manages one of the highestranking public pension plans in the country in terms of return on investment  the new mexico legislature provides the employer’s portion of the monthly contributions to a member’s account  the nmerb is a state agency accountable not only to its members and its board but also to the legislature and governor  it is selffunded meaning that the operating budget for the association is provided from the return on investment of the fund  the nmerb uses no money from the state’s general fund board members and agency personnel pride themselves on a conservative and careful approach to investing and inhouse procedures provide economy board members and nmerb personnel who have built the organization take great pride in nmerb’s sound actuarial management its efficient operations and its memberoriented focus retirement in new mexico hasn’t always been funded or structured as it is today  what we take for granted now didn’t exist in the early s  in fact no pension plan whatever existed for any public servant  the first serious efforts to create a pension plan for new mexican educators took place in  when gov arthur hannett and the legislature passed landmark legislation establishing the first pension plan of any kind for public servants on march  house bill  an act relating to the retirement of faculty members in state educational institutions and providing for the payment of annuities thereto was passed marking the beginning of an year history that has formed the present new mexico educational retirement system     an informal beginning durinng the  landmark session  legislature john hall provides insight on the ways the legislature was governed “the committees of both houses were powerful and at times highly arbitrary in their conduct no calendars were kept committees met at the call of the chair and no minutes of the proceedings were preserved furthermore there is nothing in the state constitution or in the rules of either house to compel a committee to consider or report a bill  “all members of both houses either spoke or understood english   however interpreters were available in the lower house the house of representatives when a member of spanish descent insisted that his argument could be better made in his mother tongue copies of the bills were printed in english and spanish” despite these irregularities the  retirement act was groundbreaking legislation  house bill  the state’s first pension plan for public servants was created in a small state of  geographically remote from the centers of policy making at that time – a remarkable accomplishment   who thought up this retirement idea anyway millionaire and philanthropist andrew carnegie deserves credit for helping establish a political and social climate that recognized the value of educators he was an unusual man  as his fortune grew he came to believe that surplus personal wealth should be used for service to humanity in particular for educational purposes and to protect and promote democracy  carnegie created the teachers’ insurance and annuity company in  with a donation of  million to provide a means for college professors to receive retirement pensions  his foundation provided “free” pensions  no contributions were required from the teacher  as time went on it became clear that no infusion of dollars could provide free pensions for all college teachers and in  the teachers insurance and annuity association tiaa was formed to provide annuities under a contributory system  this company became a model for modernday pension plans and tiaacref still exists today as a provider of annuities to university educators in america   a rocky beginning the first retirement legislation in new mexico also applied only to faculty members at the university level  it was to be fully funded by the legislature with no contribution required from the employee or university   strangely an important feature of the bill was language that made it clear that potential retirees had no right to benefits and that university boards of regents had the power to grant or deny an applicant benefits without having to offer a reason for refusing any petitioner   another quirky feature of new mexico’s first pension plan was the absence of a legislative appropriation to provide retirement benefits even though the legislation stated that funding would be provided to the operating budgets of universities this oversight did not stop universities from retiring some faculty boards of regents had minds of their own when deciding to award pensions in may  charles e hodgin a university of new mexico professor of education for most of his career was approved for retirement thus making him the first educational retiree and the first educator to receive a state public pension in new mexico  hodgin happened to be the vice president of the university of new mexico at the time of his retirement  a second retirement under this act was awarded to a mary h eckles by the board of regents of the  new mexico state teacher’s college now new mexico western university  hodgin was the first person in any public profession to be granted a public pension in new mexico and he and mary eckles are the only recorded retirees in that year two years later the legislature removed the quirks from the retirement legislation for university faculty funded it and went on to pass a pension plan for firemen in municipalities of more than  people   public school employees however were still without a pension plan the legislative bodies of  and  did not consider the subject of retirement the legislature met once every two years at this time in new mexico history   in  new legislation was passed providing a retirement plan for all public school and university teachers this plan provided for joint funding from the legislature and contributions made by teachers in the following amounts salary contribution less than  per month    per month    per month  more than  per month   however no one actually retired under this comprehensive new plan because its requirement for contributions from teachers conflicted with the  act which provided “free” retirement for university professors but that act had never been repealed  the state now boasted two retirement plans for educators with the provisions of one contradicting those of the other at this point the legislature charged the state board of education with implementing the  act  however they did not act  according to ken davis past director of the erb “the state board minutes for the four years that this law was on the books  do not reveal one single mention of this retirement law  in view of the inaction of the state board it is probable that very few teachers even knew about the law” senate bill  passed in february  enacted yet another retirement bill for teachers  but this one was the first really workable public school retirement plan part of it is reproduced below an act relating to the retirement of public school teachers and providing an annuity or pension therefore senate bill no   approved february   be it enacted by the legislature of the state of new mexico section  the board of county commissioners of any county in this state shall have the power by a majority vote thereof to retire any public school teacher who shall have taught in the public schools of the state of new mexico for a period or periods aggregating thirtyfive years and who shall in the opinion of a majority of such board be in needy circumstances such persons shall thereafter during the remainder of his or her life receive an annuity or annual pension payable monthly of not to exceed onehalf of the maximum annual salary received by such person during the five years next preceding his or her retirement hereunder provided that such annuity not exceed  per annum section  the amount of such annuities shall be included in the annual budget of the county in which the board of county commissioners has retired such persons and a sufficient levy to pay the same shall be made annually on the real property in said county by the board of county commissioners   a decadeslong ripple effect the philosophy of the legislature regarding public school funding took a dramatic turn in   with the passage of the emergency school tax act which established that financing the public was the state’s responsibility rather than primarily a local function  in  there was finally just one retirement plan in effect after the legislature repealed previous acts relating to retirement  the  retirement act would govern teachers’ retirement in the state for the next  years there was just one problem the  retirement act did not require contributions from members and this decision by policy makers turned out to have a significant effect on the longterm actuarial soundness of the fund in the decades that followed  today higher employer contributions approved by the legislature in  under senate bill  guarantee the solvency and actuarial soundness of the nmerb fund another retirement bill sb  known as the seyfreid bill had also been introduced during the  session which provided for member contributions of five percent of salary that would have been matched by the state  the benefit paid to a retiree would be the amount that the employer and employee contributions together with interest earned  the seyfried bill was actuarially sound and would have resulted in a stronger retirement system  however other factors came into play that prevented its passage one of those factors was the emergence of the new mexico education association nmea as a powerful player in the debate over how to structure retirement in new mexico  the only education association for many years until the arrival of the nm american federation of teachers in the s the nmea came out in favor of a different bill declaring that the average teacher would be unable to understand the provisions of the seyfried bill in truth nmea was far more likely to support a bill that required no contribution from teachers than the seyfried bill which did so the  retirement act remained in effect for the next two decades   the educational retirement board is launched the first meeting of the educational retirement board was held in march   although the board headed by superintendent of public instruction grace corrigan was not established by law until the legislative session of  it operated de facto serving the needs of members during the war years apparently without problems policy wasn’t set by the board but retirements were approved  the legislature did not pass any laws affecting public retirement in   the first session in  years that did not pass some sort of retirement legislation affecting public schools  perhaps in the thick of world war ii concerns members of the legislature had other matters on their minds  in the postwar years numerous policy changes were made in the educational retirement act primarily in the way the retirement act was administered by the erb and to its amendments chief among these changes was bringing all educational agencies under one retirement act which was accomplished in  full credit was given to returning service men and women for the time they spent in the armed forces and the erb was finally made a legal entity  by law composition of the board was to be the state superintendent of public instruction the state educational budget auditor the state treasurer the president of the new mexico education association and the president of the emeritus employee’s association of new mexico  the board’s makeup remains essentially the same today with the addition of a member elected by the american association of university professors and two people appointed by the governor minus the budget auditor a position that no longer exists  the nmerb begins investing the first recorded investment by the new mexico state treasurer of the retirement fund which at that time was  was ordered by state school superintendent georgia lusk who also headed the nmerb in may of   apparently no one had given thought previously to putting retirement fund dollars to work  this was fairly typical of the unsophisticated approach to the retirement business practiced by the board during these early years  the nmerb engaged an actuary to make a report on the fund’s solvency in  but at the board’s only meeting in  nmerb director floyd santisteven reported that the study had not been accomplished because several of the districts were tardy in their reporting this easycomeeasygo attitude seems improbable by today’s thinking especially in light of the strict requirements under which the presentday system functions   the erb today requires an actuarial study each year a yearly outside audit of the agency and close oversight by both the legislative and administrative arms of state government amazing to consider that in  no records of incoming or outgoing moneys were recorded at all nor were any detailed records kept of the calculations or amounts each pensioner received major changes to the state’s retirement act took place during the s following an actuarial study that revealed that funds assets as of june   were  and liabilities were listed at   a whopping  deficit the report made several strong recommendations to put the program back on track  recommendations included increased contributions from the state employee contributions and that complete and detailed records of the system and membership be maintained  it also stated an annual valuation should be made to determine the true condition of the system the board’s response to these suggestions was that “it might try to implement some of them” and “the board saw no immediate necessity to set up a contribution for a special fund for liquidating the accrued liability…” davis  trimmer   in the end the process of setting the fund on the road to a sound actuarial basis was begun by an ad hoc state reorganization committee in  this committee recommended that the state legislature create a committee to study state retirement funds  the study’s findings were clear  employee contributions were essential to the soundness and solvency of the state’s retirement plan for education employees  with the support of the nmea behind it the new mexico legislature passed the educational retirement act of  a true retirement plan with policy in place that would put the fund on a firm actuarial footing for the next several decades in january  the legislature’s house education committee was told that the erb projected a  billion shortfall its assettoliability ratio was about  percent and that if uncorrected the fund faces “severe problems”  news of the projected shortfall spread rapidly throughout the state to public school employees legislators and the general public even though the nmerb made clear that the pension fund is able to pay the current level of benefits without contribution changes for the next  to  years in response to the projected shortfall nmerb moved swiftly to gain the support of the nm legislature resulting in the legislature’s decision to increase the state’s and members contribution thereby adding long term improvement  managing the retirement assets of new mexicos educators santa fe   albuquerque   tollfree  copyright
