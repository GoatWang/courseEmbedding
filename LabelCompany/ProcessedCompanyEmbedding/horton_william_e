years old certificate vignette horton plane photos from popular science magazine horton aircraft corporation santa ana california was founded by william horton who dreamed of a wingless airplane instead of a long high aspect ratio wing the fuselage was to create the lift and tip plates which he called sealers were to tip losses that otherwise plague such airfoilsnot truly wingless but essentially a highlymodified cessna uc with a more airfoilshaped fuselage than wing although this innovative protoype flew successfully no backers were attracted and the project was abandoned with the plane eventually being deliberately burnedthe following is part of the th annual report of the securities and exchange commission fiscal year ended june  horton aircraft corporation  this registrant a nevada corporation was organized for the purpose of manufacturing and selling a socalled horton wingless airplane the company filed two registration statements with the commission the first statement filed in  covered a proposed offering of  shares of no par value common stock of which  shares were to be offered by the registrant and  shares by the president william e horton at  per share or the market price whichever was higher the other registration statement filed in  covered  shares of common stock ofthe registrant held by horton which was to be offered at  per share a consolidated hearing was held as to both registration statements and the commission issued a stop order suspending the effectiveness of both statementsthe commission found the registration statements false and misleading in the following material respects among othersthe representation in the registration statements that horton had assigned to the registrant a patent with respect to the wingless airplane was materially misleading in view of the fact that horton had previously assigned all of his righttitle and interest in his invention to another person the description in theregistration statements of the horton wingless airplane the aeronautical principles involved and the coverage of the patent obtained by horton was also materially false and misleading false and misleading statements were also made with respect to the performance of hortons model of the wingless plane the registration statements also contained false and misleading statements with respect to the use of the proceeds from the previous sale of unregistered securities the price of the securities being registered and the proposed use of the proceeds therefromin addition the commission found that while the second registration statement disclosed the entry of an injunction against registrant and horton based on false and misleading claims and the return of an indictment against horton based on fraud registrant nevertheless
