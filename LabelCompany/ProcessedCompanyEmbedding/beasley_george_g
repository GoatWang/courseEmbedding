launched his first station watt wpybam in  in benson nc while working as an assistant principal at a public high school beasley worked evenings and weekends in radio until  by then he was a principal but he left his job to devote his attention to radio it was a good decision today beasley media group inc a subsidiary of beasley broadcast group owns and operates  radio stations  fm and  am in  large and midsize us markets on wednesday sept  the chairman ceo and founder of beasley broadcast group will receive the national radio award at the radio show in atlanta reach and cash flow the fact that george beasley has been in radio for more than five decades has not dimmed his love for the industry nor his passionate belief in its future asked whether he would make the same decision to invest in radio today as he did in  beasley replied “i would because radio continues to maintain its weekly listenership base of plus percent of americans age  or older a level which has not changed much over the past decade as an investment radio valuations today are not demanding and with a disciplined approach to operations and the delivery of great local content radio still delivers excellent cash flow” radio’s continuing strength among young listeners is well documented beasley said this important fact is discounted by the industry’s naysayers but remains true nevertheless husband and wife george and ann beasley in a photo circa early s “research continues to show that when asked  to yearolds indicate that they have actually increased their time spent listening to radio” he said “radio can compete effectively against pure streamers satellite and ipods and hd is a great medium for doing so and recapturing listening growth in youth and other demos” to bolster his argument that radio remains relevant in the digital age george beasley cited att’s decision to include fm chip activation in its  android smartphone device specifications and a subsequent announcement from nextradio that tmobile plans a similar move “initially their customers will be the biggest beneficiaries of this decision as they will have access via their smartphones to local radio news entertainment weather and failsafe emergency alert connectivity” said beasley “furthermore with access to certain apps their listeners will enjoy song tagging and interactivity features that have become increasingly popular with younger listeners” as for the general notion that radio broadcasting is being overwhelmed by the many features of webbased streaming media he dismisses the idea as a fallacy and argues that radio’s value proposition remains as solid as it was  years ago george beasley’s first radio station “in terms of the two primary constituents served by radio listeners enjoy crystalclear free broadcasts of their favorite entertainment news weather sports traffic and other local content while advertisers benefit from the ability to costeffectively reach any and all consumer target demographics” beasley said “radio’s still a great place to be … as fm chips proliferate in smartphones our younger demo listeners will be an even bigger and more important part of our overall listener base — this ties in to our ‘local’ advantage as well as consumers’ desire for everything digital” early adopter keeping up with all this change is a big challenge for any radio broadcaster but for george beasley change has always been a big part of radio “i am proud to say that beasley has been a pioneer in the adoption of technologies such as fm radio which surpassed am in the late s hd radio and ppm in the ensuing decades and streaming and mobile applications today george beasley is surrounded by  company award winners and family members rear from left dos aj lurie sw

laurels in terms of beasley media group “our immediate focus is on completing the integration of the cbs stations we swapped for last december optimizing their operations and serving the communities and listeners where we now operate” that deal sent  cbs stations to beasley — in tampast petersburg fla charlotte nc and philadelphia — for return for five of beasley’s two in philadelphia and three in miami “at the same time we’ll also continue to prioritize our successful debt and leverage reduction initiatives” the company which went public in  has long articulated a strategy of identifying and acquiring underperforming radio stations in growth markets according to its website it calls itself “the oldest continuously managed publicly traded pureplay radio broadcaster in the country” as for the radio industry as a whole “looking out today and into the future we must recognize that the social economic technological and industry landscapes have changed and that to thrive in this
