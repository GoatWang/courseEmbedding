earnings release this call is being recorded a replay of the call will be available on our website for two weeks following the call im now pleased to turn the call over to cris gaut our executive chairman cris c christopher gaut  forum energy technologies inc thanks mark good morning forum continues to show good growth in orders and revenue led by our strong position in completion and productionoriented products relative to the other us public oilfield equipment companies forum has a leading exposure to the continued growth in landbased north america completion and production spending with a growing backlog of wells yet to be fracked completed and brought on production we see an attractive runway and strong demand for our products were also pleased with the progress of our acquisition effort following the acquisition of the assets of cooper valves in the first quarter of the year we completed this month the acquisition of multilift although not a large deal multilift will add to the growing stable of artificial lift products within our completions segment  we believe the market for acquisition opportunities is continuing to improve for us so without further ado let me hand the call to forums new ceo prady iyyanki prady prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc thanks cris good morning everyone im going to provide an overview for the quarter discuss our strategy and focus areas and some operational highlights then i will turn the call over to jim harris to provide further details on our financial performance our team performed well in the second quarter our second quarter revenue was  million an  increase sequentially and we had positive adjusted ebitda for the company in every segment during the quarter we continue to execute our strategic plan of ensuring strong financial discipline having a balanced business portfolio emphasizing consumable and activitybased products and growing through organic initiatives and acquisitions this allows us to respond to market conditions in any part of the cycle currently our focus is on the robust north america completions activity and infrastructure buildout as evident from our two recent acquisitions multilift and the assets of cooper valves the us land drilling and completions activity remains strong and our us revenue in the second quarter increased  sequentially in line with growth in the us rig count and completions activity and every segment experienced revenue growth in the us during the quarter for four quarters in a row we saw an increase in our inbound orders which is a good indicator of our nearterm business prospects forums total inbound orders during the second quarter were  million a  increase from the level in the first quarter the second quarter booktobill ratio was  for the company as a whole led by  for the completions segment orders in our completions segment increased  and over  for stimulation and intervention products as customer spending improved on almost all product offerings across the segment the strong fundamentals for the pressure pumping services are driving demand for our pressure pumping products including orders for approximately  horsepower of our power ends yeartodate in addition our new products are gaining traction we received orders for eight of our new innovative manifold trailer the icbm and several good orders for our new race track suction manifold and several other new products we are starting to see price improvement on recent pressure pumping orders now in backlog which will be reflected in our second half results were pleased with the acquisition of multilift in early july the sandguard and cyclone completion tools extend the useful life of an electrical submersible pump by protecting it against sand and other solids the acquisition fits with our strategy of expanding a product offering in the artificial lift value chain forum is well positioned for the growth in artificial lift with the cannon protectors and multilift completion tools for downhole pumps and our global tubing coiled line pipe for gas lift in our production  infrastructure segment orders improved  and our booktobill ratio was  as demand continues to be strong for us land drill separation equipment i want to recognize our valves team for achieving a record level of orders during the quarter this was accomplished without any contribution from forum arabia our new manufacturing facility being built in saudi arabia which is on schedule to be fully operational in  our first quarter acquisition of cooper valves is progressing on target the integration is complete and our sales team are beginning to leverage our existing midstream and downstream customer base and distribution network to expand cooper sales orders in our drilling  subsea segment were down  resulting in a booktobill ratio of  during the quarter the decline in drilling orders was due to fewer rig upgrades as the land drilling fleet moves into a maintenance mode for the balance of the year the offshore recovery continues to lag as a result we now expect orders for our subsea product line to be at a low level for an extended period and weighted to nonoil and gas activity our operating margins continue to improve as we see the benefit of better manufacturing cost absorption and operational efficiencies and lower procurement cost our operating margins will further expand as the pricing improves in second half we continue to build our pipeline of ma targets with a primary focus on expanding our completions offering followed by midstream and downstream opportunities as we look ahead to the third quarter of  we expect demand for completions and production  infrastructure segments to increase as activity continues in the us land market our incrementals in second half in completions will be stronger than first half as pricing materializes and better absorption of rampup cost we expect our revenue to improve by around  to  and we expect a diluted loss per share to be in the range of  to  let me ask jim to take you through our results and financial position jim james w harris  forum energy technologies inc thank you prady and good morning everyone our second quarter revenue was  million an  increase sequentially this is the third increase in our quarterly revenue in a row and consolidated revenue is up  from the trough in the third quarter last year our adjusted ebitda increased  million and our adjusted net loss per share was  excluding special items an improvement from the first quarter as the us land recovery continued i will summarize our results on a sequential basis for the quarter and provide additional details on the second quarter results our drilling  subsea segment revenue of  million was up  primarily due to the improvement in sales of drilling equipment and products the completions segment revenue of  million increased  sequentially as customer spending improved on higher well construction and completions activity in north america our production  infrastructure segment revenue of  million was up  due to improved sales of both our us land well site production equipment and our valve products for the quarter we had adjusted ebitda of  million importantly this was our first positive ebitda quarter since  our incremental operating margins were  on an adjusted basis with little to no pricing improvement including the additional subsea goodwill impairment charge the net loss for the second quarter was  million or  per share the quarter included special items on a pretax basis of  million for the goodwill impairment  million of foreign exchange losses and  million of restructuring and other expenses the adjusted net loss excluding these items and the associated income taxes was  during the quarter we evaluated the carrying value of the goodwill in our subsea product line which currently represents less than  of our revenues the review was triggered by the softening of oil prices and the developing consensus view that production from lowercost oil basins would be sufficient to meet anticipated demand for a longer period this has delayed the need for production from higher cost basins like offshore as a result we determine that the carrying value of the remaining goodwill and our subsea product line was impaired our free cash flow after net capital expenditures in the second quarter was  million which included an irs tax refund of about  million with the accelerated receipt of this anticipated tax refund in the second quarter and our continued build in working capital due to increased revenue expectations in the second half of the year we now expect to be free cash flow positive no later than the first quarter of  as earnings continue to improve our net capital expenditures in the second quarter were  million our budget for  capital expenditures is approximately  million which includes the investment in our new production facility in saudi arabia expected to come online later this year our balance sheet and financial position remained strong we ended the quarter with  million of cash on hand and with no bank debt outstanding we closed the multilift acquisition in early july for approximately  million using available cash we remained well positioned and ready to execute our acquisition strategy our weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter was  million shares when we turn profitable on a net income basis the diluted share count will increase to approximately  million shares at the current share price to once again include the impact of options net debt at the end of the second quarter was  million down  million bringing our net debt to total capitalization ratio to  interest expense was  million in the second quarter corporate expenses were  million and we now expect corporate expenses to be around  million in the third quarter depreciation and amortization expense was  million for the quarter and should be similar in the third quarter our effective tax rate on the second quarter adjusted operating loss was  we estimate our effective tax rate on normal operations for the remainder of the year will be approximately  for more information about our financial results please review the earnings release on our website and with that let me turn the call back over to prady prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc thanks jim forums team is capitalizing on opportunities the market is presenting currently in north america and expanding our operating margins even without any meaningful pricing improvement im pleased with the new marketleading products the team has developed you will see us continue to invest in organic growth initiatives and execute our ma strategy especially in completions and production  infrastructure segments thank you for your interest at this point well open the line for questions operator please take the first question questionandanswer session operator our first question comes from the line of george oleary with tph  company your line is open please go ahead george o’leary  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc good morning guys i thought the results on the production  infrastructure segment were particularly interesting just given the magnitude and move quarteronquarter i realized cooper is in there now so that had something to do with it i wonder if you could just parse out maybe going forward how we should think about the production side versus the infrastructure side are we starting to see some kind of underlying demand growth on the valves side of the business or is the growth going forward still really more productionoriented ie kind of us onshore well countoriented how would you guys kind of break that out prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc yeah thanks george i would say the pi had a very strong bookings in revenue in second quarter i mean let me talk about valves for a second even without the cooper valves contribution in the second quarter they still had a record level of bookings and its primarily the upstream in north america is up and the midstream in the us is either flattish or a little bit up but were gaining market share as theres an infrastructure build out in basins for transportation gas terminals the liquid pipelines and on the international front both the midstream and downstream is pretty active and were trying to gain market share and thats one of the reasons george why we are building this operation in saudi arabia focused on middle east and downstream and were also increasing our presence in the southeast asia to penetrate the midstream and downstream part of the market on the utility side either pipelines being refurbished or the new pipeline is being built and we are maximizing on that so this is primarily a market share gain opportunity for us which were capitalizing on with the exception of riding the wave on the upstream side and on the production equipment side i think the demand is strong and we continue to ramp up on the production equipment side george o’leary  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc great thats very helpful color and then you guys have been a little bit more acquisitive and you talked about generally where youre looking to deploy incremental capital as bidask spreads have compressed i guess when i think about the completion side going forward are acquisitions going to be more focused you think on the downhole tool side of that business or more kind of flow equipment adding on to the pressure pump offering you guys have prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc yeah good question george i would say on the acquisition side i think our strategy remains intact our number one area of focus is completions which includes the surface and also the downhole products and obviously the multilift acquisition we did is consistent with the strategy right on the artificial lift which plays a roll both on the completion side and also on the production side and then the second priority is any opportunities we can get on the midstreamdownstream side would be the second priority which is also the cooper acquisition which we did in earlier part of the year so i think our ma strategy is intact id also say the ma environment is probably friendly in the second half just because the value gap has come down which is primarily the ipo season is coming to an end and the expectations on pricing is getting more reasonable however it is very competitive but i think deals will get done in the second half george o’leary  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc great and then maybe if i could just sneak one more in prady the multilift acquisition is one that seems pretty intriguing to us as there does seem to be a growing trend of esps and esps being in wells over longer durations than they historically were especially us onshore these kind of high pressure longerlateral horizontal wells given kind of the unique nature of that business to some degree it seems to me that that might be accretive to forums margins i realize the transaction wasnt super large but would you call that kind of product line within the forum complex accretive to you alls margins prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc so were really excited about multilift george i would say its accretive to the business probably the deal got done at a historic ranges which you have seen us do in the past itll be meaningful for the downhole product line in  its going to move the needle for those guys and again its an ip protected product the sandguard which is a selfcleaning device without any flow disruptions and also the cyclone product and i think our differentiation in the cyclone product is theyve a lot of different configurations out there and in our case one size fits all and in the case of sandguard which is an ipprotected product the competitive landscape is very favorable to us and the customer saves significant amount of cost when the pump has a failure because of the sand intrusion into the esp so were really excited about the multilift acquisition and consistent with our acquisition strategy are focused on completions george o’leary  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc great thanks very much for the color guys prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc thanks george operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of martin malloy with johnson rice your line is open please go ahead martin w malloy  johnson rice  co llc good morning c christopher gaut  forum energy technologies inc hi martin james w harris  forum energy technologies inc hey martin martin w malloy  johnson rice  co llc had a question on the drilling  subsea segment and maybe if you could talk a little bit more about whats going on there the revenues are relatively flat it looks like quarteroverquarter and the inbounds were down quite a bit and if you could maybe talk about that what youre seeing with the drilling rig land drilling rig upgrade cycle and particularly the mud pumps and how much longer that might last prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc yeah good question marty i would say on the – let me talk about the consumables and then also about the capital equipment then ill also talk about the subsea piece on the consumable front our expectation is with the rig count stabilizing or maybe a little bit of decline some of the active rigs will go into the maintenance mode but they will still need the opex part of the consumables but what we expect to see is less mud pump upgrades in second half compared to the first half however completionweighted products like the centrifugal pumps the little trippers and bearings we expect still good activity on that front but overall we expect the drilling product line to have a decline in the third quarter from a revenue standpoint now fourth quarter there are a few variables there mostly on the capital equipment side is there are several discussions with customers on upgrading the lower spec rigs to the higher spec rigs where the content for us could be anywhere from  million to  million and primarily where we come into play is rather than just doing the recertification we are upgrading our catwalks extending the reach and the height and the  psi upgrades and also in some cases the handling tools and the conditionbased monitoring could play a role theres a little bit of uncertainty there when thats going to materialize but the pipeline on that in us pretty good and theres a little bit more uncertainty on the international front but the pipeline on the international front is a little stronger than what it was about four months ago primarily in middle east and in india and also in north america but more in middle east and in india so on the capital equipment side there is a level of uncertainty but if some of that materializes our fourth quarter could be stronger than third quarter but we dont know at this point on the subsea front marty i would say that we have a great franchise we got a great team its a bad market on the oil and gas front but in our case its less than  of the portfolio and our target again for this year is ebitda flat at the product line level so it doesnt drag the mother ship down but we are exploring opportunities outside oil and gas and ill be disappointed if we dont announce any orders in the second half of  because there is a pipeline for us outside oil and gas but the oil and gas is pretty weak and the pipeline is pretty much nonexistent on the oil and gas side so we continue to streamline our operations on the subsea and make very selective investments to protect the franchise but again its less than  of the portfolio martin w malloy  johnson rice  co llc okay and then a second question could you talk about in the specific product lines where youre seeing the lead times stretch out the most and where you think you have the opportunity to start to have pricing discussions with your customers about increasing pricing prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc yeah well great question marty i would say si stimulation and intervention the pressure pumping part of the portfolio across the board i think i would say demand is very strong as evident from our bookings and also revenue the last two three quarters we are still ramping up fast and its still hand to mouth the lead times are extending and it is providing opportunities for us from a pricing standpoint and i would say later part of second half the tail end of second quarter the pricing started materializing not meaningful in second quarter but well start seeing that in the results in the third quarter and fourth quarter and thats one of the reasons why we said is our second half incrementals on completions will be stronger than what youve seen in the first half but the lead times are getting extended and we are getting pricing opportunities now the other point on the si side is with the significant amount of growth were seeing on the top line and bookings were adding significant amount of people our workforce has increased significantly and theres a little bit of productivity which will catch up in the second half of  right i mean the folks who come new are not productive right from day one it takes a couple of months for them to be productive so were not seeing the operational productivity yet in si but we do expect to see that in second half and on top of it the pricing which is materializing which is already in the backlog will start materializing in the second half and then the other product line is production equipment it is pretty much hand to mouth and the lead times are extending we got a very strong backlog going into third quarter and fourth quarter however the pricing on the production equipment is fourth quarter first quarter price right because as you remember we got the chunky orders in fourth quarter and first quarter which are still flowing through the shop but i would say late fourth quarter well start seeing that pricing materialize through the operations too jim james w harris  forum energy technologies inc yeah marty i would also just highlight that similar to production equipment we always talk about our stimulation and intervention business being a bookandship business but given the strength of the demand that weve had in orders weve actually built a backlog there so likewise weve taken orders in the first half of this year and some of those early in the years especially for the power ends that was at pricing that was very aggressive and while weve seen pricing increase until we deliver on the backlog that we now have at these lower prices once thats done well start seeing the benefit of these pricing increases that prady was describing but thats a little bit of a subtle change from what weve said in the past about si just given the level of backlog we have today martin w malloy  johnson rice  co llc great thank you prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc thanks marty operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of scott gruber with citigroup your line is open please go ahead scott a gruber  citigroup global markets inc yes good morning prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc good morning scott scott a gruber  citigroup global markets inc prady the pickup in middle east demand you highlighted earlier can you provide some color just across the product spectrum when you look at upstream midstream downstream is it primarily midstream and downstream at this point or is some of the upstream orders trying to pick up as well prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc yeah i think our initial focus – the manufacturing facility were building in saudi arabia will be focused on the midstream and downstream part of the portfolio more particularly in valves and our customers are showing pretty good interest there and also the local content – we meet the local content requirements which also gives us a pricing premium and i think the operation will be active in the fourth quarter of  but fully operational in  but as we go through that process were going to put other products too in the manufacturing location later part of  and  which would be focused on the completion side and also some of the other products lines on the – like for example some of the subproduct lines in drilling so i think the focus is across the spectrum but initially the focus of the manufacturing shop will be on the midstream and downstream more particularly on valves scott a gruber  citigroup global markets inc got it prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc but id also say we are gaining momentum we do have commercial presence now than what we had in the past and that commercial team is gaining traction on the completion side and some orders and revenue are already trickling down but the manufacturing location is still here in us scott a gruber  citigroup global markets inc and then how do you think about expanding your capabilities on the rig equipment side do you wait to tie it to the big tenders in the middle east coming into the market or do you try to move ahead any color you can provide on those bigger tenders and what youre seeing there prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc sure i would say listen the pipeline in middle east – in fact i would say thats the region which has a strongest pipeline on the capital equipment side whether its kuwait or whether its abu dhabi or whether its saudi aramco or whether its even qatar i mean the whole middle east is – the pipeline is pretty strong scott however things are moving to the right theres one middle eastern customer we just recently heard that maybe some tenders could happen in the fourth quarter and our view is probably theyre expecting – theyre waiting for the oil price to go past  and some of those tenders will come into fruition and we have pretty good installed fleet in middle east from a forum standpoint in fact we have the biggest catwalk installed fleet in middle east and a pretty good service team in middle east so i think that part of the business will continue to be strong in middle east were trying build up the completions and the production infrastructure part of the portfolio in middle east as part of the manufacturing location scott a gruber  citigroup global markets inc got it and if we just take a longerterm view you highlighted the expansion in southeast asia focusing on midstream and downstream again what do you envision – where do you envision potentially going over the next five years thinking about the expansion and shale activity in argentina and some of your competitors nov and schlumberger are forecasting a rig upgrade cycle in russia could you just provide some color on where else youre thinking about expanding internationally to take advantage of opportunities as shale goes global and opportunities to upgrade the land rig fleet internationally prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc yeah so i think on the pressure pumping side scott our main focus is north america and as we mentioned right now were handtomouth and the demand is strong and we need to ramp up fast so right now i think all our resources and everything is focused in north america and then were going to start penetrating canada too but right now – our focus right now is in the us in argentina and china and some of the other countries i mentioned theyre still at an early phase i think if we just look from an opportunity standpoint its still small and we are not fully penetrated yet in north america and canada and one of the things we do like is our products are gaining traction in north america some of the new products weve commercialized so a lot of market share opportunity for us in us and canada then also on international front some of our existing customers will take us there right i mean as they go on international front some of those pressure pumpers they will take us and the products will be – weve got to put some service locations there but right now our focus more is in us and north america now the southeast asia right now – listen when the offshore boom was good we had a pretty good install fleet on onshore and offshore but right now the biggest opportunity we see in far east is on the infrastructure buildout side which is primarily the valves part of the business theres a market where we dont participate and our supply chain – most of our supply chain is in that part of the world so i think its a lowhanging fruit which we want to take advantage of and as the revenue starts coming and as the profitability starts coming from the southeast asia well start building the infrastructure for the rest of the segments too scott a gruber  citigroup global markets inc got it appreciate the color prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc thanks scott operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of rob mackenzie with iberia capital your line is open please go ahead rob j mackenzie  iberia capital partners llc good morning guys i wanted to come back to the subsea product line for a minute in the wake of the technipfmc merger and their decision to standardize going forward on the schilling product line are there any specific legacy schilling customers that you think are right to pick off and convert to perry in the next upcycle prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc absolutely i think there is an opportunity there rob and i think the closer that tie becomes between the schilling and technip some of our customers will see them as competitors and that does give us the opportunity to penetrate the market on the oil and gas front but id also say is one of the things we are pleased about our subsea team is we are diversifying outside oil and gas whether its the telecom or whether its the defense or whether its the marine research or whether its the wind farm and we think for the next couple of years when the market is down we can still pay the bills and protect the franchise and then once the oil and gas business comes thats on top of right the business which were going to have outside the oil and gas but absolutely to your point i think that will give us the opportunity to penetrate some of the other customers and the new customers who are also coming on board that will also give us the opportunity to penetrate those customers rob j mackenzie  iberia capital partners llc great thanks and then on the completions side i guess – i understand why pricing takes a while to occur there but im a bit surprised given the strong growth in revenues sequentially that incremental margins and absolute margins therefore werent higher than they were is there some other moving parts there that you could help us to understand that prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc its a great question well i would say if you look at our growth in second quarter from a revenue standpoint i mean two segments drove that growth right one is the completions segment and the second one is the pi segment and i want to talk about two specific product lines there which will add more color here is the si the production equipment were strong as part of the revenue growth contribution and si i think jim added some color is on one front we are ramping up significantly just not for the second quarter were also ramping up for the third quarter and fourth quarter based on the backlog were building and a significant amount of orders we are seeing which is providing – which is causing some productivity issues in the shop because of all the new people coming on board and also on the pricing front the service customer started getting pricing earlier than us and now we are seeing less resistance from the service customers on the pricing discussions as a result we started seeing the price materialize in the tail end of second quarter which will start materializing into the results in third quarter and fourth quarter right and thats why think our incrementals on the completions side will be much stronger in second half than first half the second point from color standpoint is production equipment and as you know historically it has been a low margin business and we took chunky orders in the fourth quarter and first quarter of the last year and the pricing was fourth quarter and first quarter pretty much at the bottom or a little bit higher in the first quarter and that is still flowing through the shop because weve got a very strong backlog in the third quarter pretty much every – weve got everything in the backlog for the third quarter right with little opportunity that we could take on a little bit more work but in the fourth quarter tail end of fourth quarter is when well start realizing the prices which we started quoting in second and more importantly in third quarter too so factor of those two production equipment and si pricing materializing in the tail end of second quarter and of the absorption productivity issues we have because of all the new people c christopher gaut  forum energy technologies inc and just to highlight rob when the completions business is at a run rate thats almost doubling every six months with an extremely high growth like that and strong demand that we see and the runway in front of us weve got to build for the future demand we see that the markets there so we have been adding costs weve been adding people adding equipment so theres some rampup costs that were seeing here in the second quarter in anticipation of the strong market and the strong orders that were building and so those costs did affect our margins in q but i think youll see the benefit of not only the continued high rate of growth there but better margins later in the year but were just trying to accommodate such a fastgrowing market thats a challenge prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc and probably another data point rob we can talk about because a lot of things we do feel about is the margin expansion which is happening is if you take our pi equipment out from an incremental standpoint our incrementals are  and without production and equipment our incrementals are  right so we are seeing incrementals and as we start getting the price and the cost absorption which cris talked about i think incrementals will be stronger in second half rob j mackenzie  iberia capital partners llc great thats very helpful and then one final question if i can on the completions segment is there any way for you guys to pull out of that of your numbers in the growth in revenue how much of that is coming from the new oem equipment versus repairing or replacing worn out parts on active equipment in the field already prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc yeah no i think its a great question i would like to use power end as a data point being a capital equipment i would say probably  newbuilds and  refurbished or replacements thats what were seeing on the power ends and then as you go down the chain then the refurbishment becomes a bigger percentage and the capital equipment becomes a little smaller percentage rob j mackenzie  iberia capital partners llc okay thats helpful thank you c christopher gaut  forum energy technologies inc thanks rob operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of marc bianchi with cowen your line is now open please go ahead marc bianchi  cowen  co llc thank you so talked a lot about the different segments and in terms of what the nearterm outlook is and i was hoping we could just sort of review and make sure ive got it all down and im just going to run through this and maybe you can tell me where maybe if there is anything youd update or change it sounds like drilling possibly down a little bit in the third quarter subsea flattish completions growing at a pretty healthy pace and pi about flat would you agree with that or how would you change that prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc ds i think youre right on in third quarter completions yes strong growth pi strong growth c christopher gaut  forum energy technologies inc yeah good fundamentals there marc and as you can tell from the high booktobill rate there for bookandship business marc bianchi  cowen  co llc sure prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc but the ds decline and then the completions and production  infrastructure significant growth marc bianchi  cowen  co llc okay great and then in terms of the margin leverage there completions at the top and then how about between ds and pi prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc i think in the case of ds since the revenue is going down right i think well manage the cost and streamlining of the operations but i think whats going to move the incrementals for us is the completions and on the production infrastructure side as we talked about is the production equipment has always been a lowmargin business so even though they will have margin expansion they cannot move the needle for us marc bianchi  cowen  co llc okay and nice to hear that youre getting some pricing traction in completions how much have you seen so far how much is kind of baked into the outlook for the third quarter curious if you could provide some more color prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc yeah then for competitive reasons obviously marc we dont want to share that however i can add some color to it is i would say by no means its a broadbased price recovery across all the segments where we are seeing price opportunities is in si the pressure pumping part of the portfolio and a little bit on the production equipment side right but were not seeing pricing opportunities on the downhole products however we are commercializing some new products for example on the global tubing joint venture we have commercialized our new quencher product which is the duracoil and obviously thats much more reliable and durable and we do expect the pricing to be better than the old coils but the new products are driving the pricing in the downhole front bottom line is i think its si and its the production equipment which is again a lowmargin business marc bianchi  cowen  co llc sure well thanks for that prady ill turn it back prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc thanks marc operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of sean meakim with jpmorgan your line is open please go ahead sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc thank you james w harris  forum energy technologies inc hey sean sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc morning prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc good morning sean sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc i was hoping just to drill into the valves a little bit you highlighted a good bit about the downstream opportunity particularly as the middle east and asia pac seems like theres tons of runway there but how about in the us weve seen so many of these petrochemical projects start to move forward it seems like theres a lot of opportunity here as well maybe you could size the two a little bit for us and maybe give us a little more of a sense of what the mix looks like for your us valves franchise prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc yeah some of that marc sic sean is already reflected in our valves bookings and thats one of the reasons why we had a record quarter not including cooper and i would say the infrastructure buildout continues to happen whether its for the basins for transportation or gas terminals or liquid pipelines the downstream in the us is down the refineries in the petrochemical part of the product line – part of the segment is down in north america but not internationally internationally the downstream is pretty buoyant and so is the midstream part of the portfolio so again its a big market and we have a small market share so i would say the prospects for our valves business is – its back on growth track and we are excited about our growth opportunities in valves and whether its midstream or downstream on the international front which is all upside for us or the market share opportunities in us and were also riding the upstream being up in north america c christopher gaut  forum energy technologies inc and thats positive in the valves business from a mix standpoint that greater contribution from the upstream and some from the midstream relative to downstream is positive for margins from a mix standpoint prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc and probably the other point which is worth mentioning is the cooper acquisition was a strategic acquisition and cooper is pretty much on the midstream and the downstream part of the portfolio and that exposes the power market and also the chemical – the petrochemical market which were talking about and a lot of opportunity there in the cooper side too c christopher gaut  forum energy technologies inc okay time for one more question operator our last question comes from the line of john watson with simmons  company your line is open please go ahead john watson  simmons  company international good morning guys thanks for squeezing me in prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc good morning c christopher gaut  forum energy technologies inc hey john john watson  simmons  company international to followup on an earlier question prady in drilling could you provide us any idea surrounding the number of  psi and third mud pump upgrades forum completed in the first half and maybe the potential number of rig upgrades moving forward prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc yeah there are some moving elements still john but i think probably the guidance we can give is the second half for sure starting third quarter we do see – from a run rate standpoint we do see a decline in the mud pump upgrades and more in the fourth quarter because we do have some in the backlog i think our opportunity would be on some of those capital equipment discussions were having with the customers where they may also need  upgrades pretty much where youre already hearing the marketplaces customers are trying to take  horsepower rig and upgrade that to the latest greatest spec from a rig standpoint which gives us the opportunity to not only recertify our catwalk but also upgrade it to the latest spec and then it can opportunities in the handling tools and conditionbased monitoring and that could be a content anywhere from  million to  million so how much of that will offset the mud pump decline we dont know at this point of time but as weve said if some of those things start materializing i think the fourth quarter could be a little stronger than q but we dont know at this point of time john watson  simmons  company international right okay and then on the power end front as of the q call i think annualized orders were around  today its closer to  how much might that pace accelerate in the back half of the year could we be around  million horsepower for the full year prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc i think the run rate is obviously – if you look at the run rate it feels like that but it also depends on how much more frac fleets will come into the marketplace between now and end of the year john i would say listen we had  million horsepower by the i think last – when we had the last call and right now we have about  horsepower of power ends but the run rate is – it feels like  million but it also depends how much more frac fleet theyre going to put in the marketplace our expectation is probably will land somewhere between  million to  million horsepower if we read right the same things which you guys read but certainly we have a shot towards that c christopher gaut  forum energy technologies inc and john its probably fair to say at this point that the easy stuff to be put to work went to work a while ago and anything thats put out to work there now whether refurbished or obviously new will require a new power end so any additions from this point do require new power ends iron prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc its a great point right once we go past the  million  million horsepower they will – refurbishing more with new versus trying to repair them john watson  simmons  company international well i think you all will get to  million for whatever thats worth and then one last unrelated followup jim on the free cash flow guidance seems like theres been a bit of a change from positive in the back half to positive in early  can you provide any additional color surrounding that change and maybe color around commodity price or rig count thats incorporated into that guidance james w harris  forum energy technologies inc sure so john one of the big changes is when we gave the guidance on the second half we were expecting that large tax refund to come in the second half and just through the hard work of our tax department and other folks we were able to get it in june so that was a  million move and thats why we were cash flow positive in the second quarter even though we had given guidance that we expected negative but as we look at the second half cris described as were growing the startup costs that were putting in place with labor and others as were ramping up the same is true for our inventories so we are continuing to purchase and invest in materials so that we can ramp up production to meet what we expect to be the demand and were still obviously at a low base of earnings and so the confluence of still low ebitda while investing in rapid growth is whats driving us into the negative cash flow and once we work through that even if growth continues well be able to do as we have historically grow positively with positive free cash flow and still cover those investments its just theres a bridge here in the second half that were hedging a little bit john watson  simmons  company international right okay thanks ill turn it back prady iyyanki  forum energy technologies inc thanks jim thanks for your interest two segments the completions segment and the production  infrastructure segments are two strong tailwinds for us during the second half and if you look at our bookings about  of the bookings came from those two segments and were excited about that and well talk more at the next investor call thanks for your interest operator ladies and gentlemen thank you

about the current market conditions afterwards i will turn it over to prady who will address the rampup in activity and our outlook and then jim will discuss our financial results and the impact of resetting our sga cost run rate for the recovery the recovery in the us land drilling and completions activity is well underway and forum is highly leveraged to it our us revenue in the first quarter increased  sequentially roughly in line with the change in the us rig count the primary contributors were completions drilling consumables and production equipment which collectively grew by  in the first quarter for the third consecutive quarter we saw an increase in our inbound orders which is a good indicator of our nearterm business prospects forums total inbound orders during the first quarter were  million thats a  increase from the level in the fourth quarter and the first quarter booktobill ratio was  for the company as a whole led by  for the completion segment orders in our completion segment increased  and were up  for our pressure pumping products as customer spending improved on almost all product offerings across the segment during the quarter orders from our pressure pumping customers were particularly strong as they were spending money to reactivate their hydraulic fracturing fleets orders in our drilling product line were up  resulting in a booktobill ratio of  during the quarter primarily on the continuing demand for rig consumable products and mud pump upgrade packages for the us land drilling market despite the weak fundamentals in the subsea oil and gas market forum was able to achieve a booktobill ratio of  in the first quarter for our subsea product line which continues to focus on nonoilfield opportunities in our production equipment product line our booktobill ratio was  as demand continues to be strong for us onshore well completions with over  of our business tied to the us land market forum is uniquely wellpositioned among manufacturing companies in a strong domestic recovery which is underway i will now turn the call over to prady prady prady iyyanki thanks cris good morning everyone the growth in orders and revenue for our products is leading to increased demand load on our manufacturing facilities we continue to ramp up production at many of our manufacturing plants were seeing strong demand for our drilling consumable products most of the completions segment and well site production equipment for these manufacturing plants our current indication is for full cost absorption in the second or third quarter of this year we have sufficient roof line and manufacturing equipment capacity and do not have facility constraints as part of the ramp up in our production we have hired a substantial number of additional manufacturing employees during the quarter and expect to continue recruitment throughout the remainder of the year our procurement team has done a great job securing capacity from our supplier for longlead items mitigating a supply chain risk by diversifying our supply base and shortening the delivery times of many of the critical items as the recovery continues to gain momentum we are beginning to see the benefit of better manufacturing cost absorption operational efficiencies and lower procurement cost for certain products in us land where demand is especially strong and with the lead times extending we are beginning to see the opportunities of price increases i am confident in our ability to increase our operating margins as the recovery gains momentum our sales and engineering teams continue to work with their customers to develop new products in particular we are developing several new products in the completions segment to address the longer laterals and higher service intensity and sand loadings now required in the shale plays ill give you a few examples we just delivered our first new pressure pumping manifold trailer the icbm which is a clean design simplifies the assembly operations and service tests this allows for a quicker and safer setup in the field and eliminates premature failure on the highpressure branch connections we designed a new innovative rack track ph suction manifold which attaches to the fluid end of better sand distribution therefore extending the life of the fluident ph we have already sold over  units during the quarter we have also engineered a new inch indiscernible valve stainless steel quintuplex fluid end to match with the  horsepower frac pump another good example is our indiscernible pressure pumping power end were getting good traction from customers on this product due to the proven reliability and performance weve added five new customers during the quarter and have received orders for over  horsepower thus far in  and continue to gain momentum our pipeline of ma targets is strong with a primary focus on expanding our completions offering for the midstream and downstream opportunities as we look ahead to the second quarter of  we expect our orders for consumable products to increase as the recovery continues in the us land market our revenues improved by around  to  positive ebitda for the first time since  and a diluted loss per share to be the range of  to  let me ask jim to take you through our results and financial positions jim jim harris thank you prady and good morning everyone our first quarter revenue was  million a  increase sequentially this is the second sequential increase in our quarterly revenue in the last two years our adjusted ebitda increased  million and our adjusted net loss per share was  excluding special items an improvement from the fourth quarter as the industry began to transition to the us land upturn the step change in sga cost required to participate in the us recovery is now in place and represents a more normalized run rate for the year i will summarize our segment results on a sequential basis for the quarter and provide additional details on the first quarter results our drilling  subsea segment revenue of  million was up  primarily due to the strong improvement in sales of drilling consumable products the completion segment revenue of  million increased  sequentially as customer spending improved on higher well construction and completions activity in north america our production  infrastructure segment revenue of  million was up  due to improved sales of our us land well site production equipment and the addition of the cooper valves asset acquisition during the first quarter although for the quarter we had adjusted ebitda of negative  million importantly we cross over to positive ebitda for the last month of the quarter as we guided in our last quarter call the first quarter improvement in earnings included overcoming the step change increase in sga necessitated by the improving market conditions in the first quarter we reinstated historical pay practices for our employees at a quarterly cost of approximately  million these practices include a return to full work schedules accruing for expected  bonuses at target levels and providing companymatching contribution to the forum k plan in addition we added about  million of sga cost in the quarter that will benefit our operations going forward as the recovery continues further our sga run rate now includes the operations of the copper valves asset acquisition the adjusted sga increased  million in the first quarter and was approximately  million going forward incremental revenue should require modest variable sga cost increases excluding the step change cost additions in the quarter our incremental ebitda margins were  with little or no pricing improvement the net loss for the first quarter was  million or  per share the quarter included special items on a pretax basis comprised of  million of foreign exchange losses and  million of transaction and other expenses the adjusted net loss excluding these items and the associated income taxes was  per share our free cash flow after net capital expenditures in the first quarter was negative  million throughout the downturn we successfully converted working capital for cash to continue to generate positive free cash flow in anticipation of the continuing recovery we are investing and our highest demand inventory items to respond to the rapid upturn in activity the increase in sales volumes are also translating in the corresponding increases and accounts receivable these investments resulted in the negative free cash flow in the quarter while we expect to use cash and operations for the first half of  as earnings continue to improve throughout the year with activity levels we should return to generating positive free cash flow in the second half of the year our growth capital expenditures in the first quarter were  million our budget for  capital expenditures is approximately  million which is sufficient for maintenance and select growth investments primarily in the middle east our balance sheet and financial position remains strong we ended the quarter with  million of cash on hand and with no banks that are outstanding we remain well positioned and ready to execute our acquisition strategy our weighted average dilutive share count for the first quarter was  million shares when we turn profitable on a net income basis the diluted share count will increase to approximately  million shares to once again include the impact of options net debt at the end of the first quarter was  million up  million bringing our net debt to total capitalization ratio to  interest expense was  million in the first quarter corporate expenses were  million and we expect corporate expenses to be around  million in the second quarter depreciation and amortization expense was  million for the quarter and should be similar in the second quarter our effective tax rate for the first quarter operating loss was  the higher effective tax rate benefit is attributable to the street items which occurred in the quarter we estimate our effective tax rate for the remainder of the year will be  for more information about our financial results please review the earnings release on our website now let me turn the call back over to cris cris gaut thanks james before we got to qa let me just note that this is my conference call as ceo having had the privilege to serve as ceo for instances infection seven years ago i will continue to be active as chairman and will participate in that role in future conference calls we brought party on for three years ago to create a more professional streamline and efficient organization that we will be among the leaders in the oil field manufacturing space since then prady has proven himself at every turn to be an excellent leader with strong business judgment i was pleased to recommend to board his move to ceo next month and i look forward to the continued growth and prosperity of the company under pradys leadership prady prady iyyanki thank you cris im honored to lead for him into his next chapter cris successfully said the direct performs business and financial strategy but the transition to bring a public company and built a foundation across with the investors and customers we established forum as a strong competitor within the oil field a different manufacturing sector and has proven to be an excellent mentor for me and many others i will ask cris to continue to assist in this leadership transition in his new position he will be actively involved with our large strategic matters as well as acquisition and capital markets of course i look forward to considering the strong partnership request we have a great team a season broad and a strong business model im excited to lead the next phase of significant profitable growth performed we thank you for your interest at this point we will open the line for questions operator please take the first question questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from david anderson with barclays your line is now open david anderson hi good morning so strong top line quarter overall and clearly you guys have leveraged to occur ph all the rate parts of the business i guess t part thats a little disappoint to us is just that the ebitda progression here you talked about kind of these additional costs that are in there and prady i think you said forecast absorption by second or third quarter can you help us to kind of understand what we should be thinking by in terms of incremental margins going forward or i guess maybe should we think about kind of fourth quarter should end up its just a little hard trying to figure out what the trajectory is right now on the ebitda path jim harris hey david yes i think that jim made the point as he was going through the explanation of the sga step change that we had that excluding that the impacts of the sga onetime effects here the incremental margins which were  in q without any pricing improvement i think the implication and the guidance that weve given is that the incremental margins in q will be a bit better than that and as we moved forward with the recovery here and what the incrementals are from there for the company as a whole will depend on a few things as you point out absorption getting to full absorption is a positive factor until you get to pull absorption and then you kind of use that one but what i havent ph kicked in yes is pricing david anderson right jim harris prady talked about some of the pricing opportunities that we are seeing we are getting to see and so incremental margins in the fourth quarter will depend upon what rate of improvement in pricing we have across our businesses by that point in time but i think the overall message is that we had good incremental margins excluding what  you know the welltelegraphed change in sga that we talked about last quarter and they should be better in the next quarter david anderson and so as we talk about pricing i guess one thing ive been kind of curious about is kind of lead times for some of your drilling and completion equipment some of the smaller operations has taken a bit longer to get flow and i would imagine there will be a precursor to kind of this long way inventory restocking cycle can you talk about those dynamics right now in terms of what you are seeing out there or is it little early to start seeing this stretching and kind of how you think this kind of walks forward in terms of inventory restocking and pricing and lead times and all that cris gaut yes yes i think specially the pressure pumping david we still have inventory in the outer rims ph and some of the other parts but some of the long lead items like where you need forging and castings we are already seeing extensions in the lead time which does give the opportunity to have discussions on pricing so those discussions have already started prady iyyanki but the demand for treating iron is high and we are ramping up our rate of production there as quickly as we can to address the rapid increase in demand and its basic economics demand and supply and when demand exceeds supply whats all we learned in economics class right cris gaut yes and if we look at our completion segment as a segment both bookings incrementals and also revenue were all very strong david anderson okay and enhance also why you need to increase the sga because you have more people working and they are going to be all working in there just a last question on that prady i think it would sense to me with a midstream and downstream opportunities in there and i noticed in the release you talked of valve orders how it is for  very strong this quarter can you quantify that valve order increase for us a bit just kind of curious how that lined up with the rate cut and maybe whats some of the primary drivers are behind that that part is maybe we talked about that too much valves in last few years just kind of curious how much is going to be a drive over the next couple of years prady iyyanki yes well i think a good question david but i think the valves numbers they gave out are i think the cooper acquisition has obviously helped but independent from the cooper acquisition if we look at our valve business we have presence and midstream downstream and upstream and we are saying activity in the upstream side which is driving some of the bookings in the valves and we had a pretty strong quarter from a booking standpoint as well cris gaut yes midstream and downstream good demand pretty steady the increase in demand for valves is on the upstream side as one would expect and in addition to that greater demand for the upstream valves is the addition of cooper which is probably levered to the power industry which we didnt really have exposure to before david anderson okay great thank you gentlemen cris gaut thanks david operator and our next question comes from jacob lundberg with credit suisse your line is now open jacob lundberg hi good morning guys thanks for taking the question cris gaut hi there jacob lundberg just wanted to drill down on the guidance for q a little more are you guys able to speak to what in your mind the guidance range on eps implies from and ebitda perspective looks like its maybe around  million to  million do you agree with that cris gaut yes obviously we didnt give ebitda guidance we gave revenue and eps and i mean you dont have your model but i think thats the parameters that we want to get back to you the reason weve given exclusive guidance this quarter for the first time in several quarters i think its a reflection of our growing confidence and visibility in the business that we havent had throughout this downturn but now with the growth in orders the several quarters have strong booktobill ratio and for us given a lot of book and ship business anything over  is very good and that we have those kind of booktobill ratios across the company so given the greater visibility our confidence yes we have the ability to look yes and say we are going to give guidance and so thats why we did that this quarter jacob lundberg okay great and then i guess looking for a sense of momentum in the completions business can you speak to how much compared with january from sort of a sequential growth perspective cris gaut yes i think there is a sequential growth or monthovermonth and right now they are trying to ramp up as fast as you can get people as fast as you can and we are seeing sequential improvement in fact we expect april to be stronger than in march jacob lundberg okay great and then last one if i could can you tell us how much cooper valves contributed in the first quarter from revenue perspective jim harris jacob we were having disclosures in our q  given the size its fairly limited and historically weve not provided that information other than what i would say already about the sga contribution jacob lundberg okay thanks harris jim harris thanks jacob operator and our next question comes from brad handler with jefferies your line is now open brad handler thanks good morning all i guess before i ask a question cris i know this doesnt sound like its a goodbye and i hope its not a goodbye but i just wanted to wish you very well in your  this next phase and just to sort of say how much ive enjoyed kind of faking being with you or following you guys through this process are you sort of coming to public with forum as well as sort of with such a clear vision and then watching so much of that come to collision thats been fun to watch and fun to ride along with you long cris gaut thank you brad brad handler okay a couple of questions i guess from me the  of orders obviously a nice big number there maybe a couple of questions around that do you have a sense for how much of that relates to new horsepower versus reactivating horsepower and then the second question is a little bit more specific to jmac is that you know is that new customer base or are you upgrading and rebuilding jmac power end themselves cris gaut yes ill take the second one first is the  if you look at our jmac or power end i mean the first quarter alone divided new customers which was not being a customer based in the past and one of the reasons why we secured that customer base is because of our proven reliability and the performance of the powers and the second question was the horsepower i think we are seeing both we are seeing some newer companies coming to the fast market and we are also seeing the refurbished power ends so we are seeing a combination of both in the  not only in the power business but the cost of board for our  for your pumping product line prady iyyanki i would add a little that a lot of the orders were for new equipment so that is an element there more than one might have thought three months ago in this space but there is also a healthy dose of replacing the power ends on existing fleet in sometimes and some cases moving from and other model pump to the newer model more efficient longer lasting pumps that jmac offers now you also asked about refurbishment so this would not include refurbishment if we are refurbishing a pump that goes into our service revenue but things are new power ends that we are talking about brad handler okay thanks for clarifying that and then just an nonrelated followup even if its a little openended i guess im curious about in the current market which has more than its fair share of uncertainty around the direction of crude despite the momentum in the us can you comment on what that does to ma conversations in other words you guys have spoken pretty clearly to the past about the need to find bottom before sellers kind of decided they are ready to sell and now presumption wise i think that there was a platform now on the basis now to see some more ma given kind of this constant sharing and perhaps to some degree a lower setting of oil prices and some people say does that lessen the ma potential in your mind as you think about the next six months or  months kind of some color on that would be appreciated prady iyyanki so i dont think it lessens it brad with this kind of recent dip hopefully it will take some of the cross off of expectation and i think another factor when you think about ma is the ipo market right sometimes people are thinking about whether i should sell a company or whether i can take it public clearly the ipo market the indiscernible has come off there and so yes i think  i dont think its had an  from our standpoint its a buyer it has not had a negative impact on the ma market and hopefully it hopes to bring things into line we will be active we are active and we are building our pipeline in the ma space cris gaut now brad probably the other thing ill add is i mean our priority is obviously the completion segment and the activity in the completion segment has picked up across the board as a result i think most of the companies are going from red to green which becomes easier not only to avoid valuations but more from a seller standpoint they dont have the impression to the selling of the  for the fall brad handler okay that will make sense thanks ill turn it back prady iyyanki thanks brad operator thank you and our next question comes from rob mackenzie with iberia capital your line is now open rob mackenzie thank you congratulations prady and thanks for all your service cris just wanted to shake that question for you again following up on the horsepower question just to ask when you look at whats the order so far obviously just a lead time to deliver those power ends and through that you would also sell what portion of the idle us frac equipment do you think has played so far to be refurbished and reactivated and versus how much do you think is left to make the prices orders for cris gaut yes now i think the  i think there is still room i think we are still in the early phase of the recovery in the frac side even though at the peak it was  million horsepower and today we are probably at  million horsepower or eight to  million horsepower but we do see opportunity and were at early phase of the recovery in the price side rob mackenzie any kind of way to put some numbers around that i mean just  horsepower that you guys won is there three times less that more four times two times what is left in terms of the revenue opportunity jim harris there was eight working and were trying to get to  million horsepower a lot of that increment requires a new power new pumps right and looking from here to get back to the  that we were at back in  that is a lot more pumps right there arent as from every incremental fleet that goes back to work is going to require more spending not less and that is why also people are working at gosh should i bring that older stuff back or does it make sense to kind of build new its like refurbishing that old house and so you know i think well continue to see fleets existing fleets brought back but were digging deeper and deeper into the stacked equipment cris gaut our thought for the utilization is still at  kind or range and as utilization goes to  and  that will also drive activity rob mackenzie right okay thank you and then i wanted to come back to switch gears to the production equipment side obviously didnt repeat the stellar quarter you had in the fourth quarter but with the pace of completions ramping up i would think that that orders there would look pretty bright the next couple of quarters can you give us some more color on how you see that trajectory playing out cris gaut now rob i think one thing we did share the last call rob was there was a  million of a chunky order that we got from one particular customer who was planning for  and that was a chunky order in fourth quarter of  so if you take that out i think production equipment guys had pretty good order but production equipment as the ducks start getting completed the activity in the production equipment will pick up and i think the completion side right now is lagging behind little bit on the drilling front it wouldnt from the number of ducts being increase in the permian and the other basins but as it starts completing the ducts there will be a need for production equipment now in the case of production equipment the lead times are little bit longer than a consumable item so we usually see the quarter ahead and thats one of the reasons why we saw that in the fourth quarter rob mackenzie okay great thank you guys i will turn it back operator and our next question comes from mart malloy with johnson rice your line is now open mart malloy good morning cris good luck with your future endeavors cris gaut thank you mart malloy just had a question maybe on the long items that we used to start to see the lead times stretch out can you give us a little more perspective on how long as were planning to stretching out and also when we should look for the impact of pricing increases starting to flow through to numbers that more of a third fourth quarter type of thing cris gaut i mean marty where we are seeing some lead time increases just not say cost of market is the portions whether its on the frac side where we do as the frac activity continues to gain momentum those lead times will increase as of now they have not increased significantly but what we are putting we are securing a supply chain for the rest of the year and the procurement team has done a pretty good job of securing the supply for the portions but thats where we are seeing it today but as the recovery continues i think we will see the increase in lead times across the board which at the same time gives the opportunity on the price side i would say we would stop seeing some minimal price increase starting in the second quarter marty but as the year progresses i think well start seeing more pricing opportunities and we will start seeing on the frac side first and then i think it will spread across the board mart malloy okay and if i could ask just on the international markets can you update us there what youre seeing particularly in the middle east cris gaut theyre all our operation in middle east is on track i think up in the second half we expect the operation to start producing from product more probably in the fourth quarter of this year i mean some of the capital equipment orders weve be talking about in middle east model yet i think that the saudi is already cancelled the which but the kuwait and nbc which were talk to you in the past i think youre moving to the right so the capital equipment i think is moving to the right but our presence in middle east is getting stronger and i think starting in the second half well start seeing some activity from our standpoint mart malloy great thank you cris gaut thank you jim harris thanks mike operator and our next question comes from indiscernible with wolf resources your line is now open unidentified analyst hey i just want to echo everyones sentiments congrats prady and cris whish you all the best and try to enjoy you know a bit more free time cris gaut thank you prady iyyanki okay chase ph unidentified analyst i guess the first question if we can kind of talk about the pace of orders throughout q and if they really accelerated as you got into march cris gaut on the frac side for sure yes we did see that moment the most in the completion segment with this march being stronger than january but ive also say part of that is contingent on i think the completions activity is lagging behind the building activity in our customers are trying to mobilize crew the equipment the logistics and whatnot right and i think theres a lag between those two so as this but completing the activity we do expect our completion segment to see more activity and thats what was evident in the first quarter at least march was january some of the other product lines ive got different dynamics i think the case of production equipment i will said the lead times a little longer so we saw a very strong q you we saw some  orders and we expect to be pretty constant on a move forward basis but i think the activity will increase if you look at our drilling product line i think the activity we are seeing is in three places right as the is the module a much greater module which is usually a one to two orders ahead so we started seeing that activity not third quarter of  q q and q we started almost three quarters we saw them a pump upgrade but where we see the increase in activity of the consumable side the opex part of the the drilling consumable our portfolio and now were seeing the activity on the on the drilling capital equipment side but more from a services standpoint where our customers are trying to upgrade or remanufacture some of the capital equipment like catwalks and rock mix ph unidentified analyst and this is very helpful its a great color appreciated i dont know if you could help us here when we think about drilling and then also think about completions how much of your revenues kind of come from services for each of these businesses and versus product cris gaut yes the services is not itself is not a big part of our revenue and its in its an aftermarket services is often a means to sell products so in our drilling business if we bring in one of our catwalks for a drawing contractor well rework it but were selling and sell a lot of parts there too and certainly on the pressure pumping side when they pump truck comes in for recertification whether its one of our yards or were doing it out in the field were going through theyre treating our in their manifold trailer and yes we certifying it but of course replacing any worn parts so in many cases the service is a means to an end to sell additional products which is where the margin is unidentified analyst okay great thats helpful last one ill turn it back over on pricing if we think about completion and kind of where pricing is today versus kind of where it peaked at you know on  could you kind of help us understand how much pricing has compressed on average for this segment cris gaut well ill give a range across the portfolio and then indiscernible across the portfolio probably you lost about  to  pricing across the portfolio at an average in the frac side we lost more and on the valve side we lost less unidentified analyst okay that is helpful all right appreciate it cris gaut but on the way up too its going to walk the same way i think will gain more pricing on the frac side and less on the valve side unidentified analyst okay thanks prady thanks cris cris gaut thanks operator and our next question comes from vaibhav vaishnav with cowen and company your line is now open vaibhav vaishnav hey good morning and congrats prady and cris good luck it is pleasure working with you cris gaut thanks vaibhav vaibhav vaishnav so if i think about inflate incremental about  in q what are the puts and takes of that actually declining as we look into second half or is that a case that they should be at least in line or better prady iyyanki i will say there are few elements for that i would say as cris mentioned there is operational efficiencies there is procurement costs and there is cost absorption on the operational side right and it is also pricing on the commercial side right so i think it depends on how we recovered the price i think the on the operational side the procurement staking the operational efficiencies and the cost absorption we expect to get those already done right we expect to get those but we also mentioned there is cost absorption starting in q some of the plants will be absorbed in the third quarter all plants where we are seeing the activities will be fully absorbed so the pricing is the element is how it recovers starting second quarter cris gaut okay and that procurement impact want to make sure as it works its way through our inventory cost that benefit vaibhav vaishnav thinking about drilling business at least the way i think is that onethird consumables one third handling tools and one third capital equipment can you help us think about what consumables obviously is progressing well can you help us think about if the capital equipment backlog driving from that backlog is near trough or early trough and also on the handling tools how thats progressing cris gaut yes on the capital equipment side i think our bottom of depleting the backlog was couple of quarters ago so consumables the drilling consumables is a big part of the drilling product line today however i think on the handling tools we expect to start seeing some activity probably in the fourth quarter at a very early stages of recovery there is still some destocking and cannibalization with indiscernible but we expect starting in fourth quarter with the handling tools i think the capital equipment piece is probably to be  piece but where we are seeing activity in the capital equipment already is what we talked about is on the services side where customers are trying to upgrade or refurbish the capital equipment and there are also some discussions very early stages with our customers is as they go to the mixed phase of getting to rigs the older rigs backed into work the amount of money they need to spend from the wallet from a capital standpoint will become little bigger than what theyve sent in the past that is more like one to five kind of range  to  million kind of range if that happens obviously we will participate in that growth tier vaibhav vaishnav okay that is helpful and last one im going to try my level best can we get to breakeven eps by the end of the fourth quarter and the path to getting there cris gaut so that as weve given weve given guidance on that the upcoming quarter that thats a big change for us we havent given guidance for some time and what happened in the fourth quarter really depends on what happens with oil prices and activity in the industry so i dont really want to comment that far out on and give guidance that far out jim harris it also depends on what so rig count point of the year was the horsepower on the on the frac side by the end of the year right when all those things will play all here vaibhav vaishnav fair enough and thanks for taking my questions operator our last question comes from john watson with simmons your line is now open john watson good morning cris gaut hi john john watson i wanted to dig back in on the  horsepower could you say how much of that was indiscernible power end and fluid end versus just power ends cris gaut yes i mean for us we sell them separately so we take orders for the power end and separately for the fluid end so sometimes theyre for the complete pump but in terms of how we track it internally we track them in a separate way so we saw a lot of fluid ends during the quarter and certainly there was a ramp up there but the power ends are bigger ticket items on an individual basis and you know thats why weve highlighted there that number and the fluid end since we do track that independently of course the bigger demand for fluid ends is the replacement market so i cant tell you exactly how many fluid ends we sold with the power end but the demand for both is strong john watson okay its helpful and then on the longer lead times for horsepower as mentioned in the press release does that imply that some of the orders that youve received in the  number that some of those might not be delivered until  or that too long lead time cris gaut i think load lead time i think its within  order i dont think lead times were grown past not being  at least from our standpoint because we can still deliver power ends within  and more importantly i think our lead times are off by month but not significantly not at this point john watson okay so if i wanted to buy the mac power end today i could get it by december  cris gaut yes we got your number jim harris we got your number john watson okay i will give a call thank you cris gaut but especially if you want december the pricing is significantly higher john watson perfect thanks guys cris gaut all right well thank you all and appreciate your attention and good questions and have a good weekend thanks bye

weighted to non oil and gas activityour operating margins continued to improve as we see the benefit of better manufacturing cost absorption operational efficiencies and lower procurement cost our operating margins will further expand as the pricing improves in the second half we continue to build our pipeline of ma targets with a primary focus on expanding our completions offering followed by midstream and downstream opportunitiesas we look ahead to the third quarter of  we expect demand for our completions and production  infrastructure segments to increase as activity continues in the us land marketour incrementals in second half in completions will be stronger than first half as pricing materializes and better absorption of rampup cost we expect our revenue to improve by around  to  and we expect a diluted loss per share to be in the range of  to let me ask jim to take you through our results and financial position jimjames whelan harris forum energy technologies inc  cfo and evp thank you prady and good morning everyone our second quarter revenue was  million an  increase sequentially this is the third increase in our quarterly revenue in a row and consolidated revenue is up  from the trough in the third quarter last yearour adjusted ebitda increased  million and our adjusted net loss per share was  excluding special items an improvement from the first quarter as the us land recovery continuedi will summarize our results on a sequential basis for the quarter and provide additional details on the second quarter resultsour drilling  subsea segment revenue of  million was up  primarily due to the improvement in sales on drilling equipment and products the completions segment revenue of  million increased  sequentially as customer spending improved on higher well construction and completions activity in north americaour production  infrastructure segment revenue of  million was up  due to improved sales at both our us land well site production equipment and our valve productsfor the quarter we had adjusted ebitda of  million importantly this was our first positive ebitda quarter since  our incremental operating margins were  on an adjusted basis with little to no pricing improvementincluding the additional subsea goodwill impairment charge the net loss for the second quarter was  million or  per share the quarter included special items on a pretax basis of  million for the goodwill impairment  million of foreign exchange losses and  million of restructuring and other expenses the adjusted net loss excluding these items and the associated income taxes was  per shareduring the quarter we evaluated the carrying value of the goodwill on our subsea product line which currently represents less than  of our revenues the review was triggered by the softening of oil prices and the developing consensus view that production from lowercost oil basins would be sufficient to meet anticipated demand for a longer period this has delayed the need for production from highercost basins like offshore as a result we determined that the carrying value of the remaining goodwill in our subsea product line was impairedour free cash flow after net capital expenditures in the second quarter was  million which included an irs tax refund of about  million with the accelerated receipt of this anticipated tax refund in the second quarter and our continued build in working capital due to increased revenue expectations in the second half of the year we now expect to be free cash flow positive no later than the first quarter of  as earnings continue to improveour net capital expenditures in the second quarter were  million our budget for  capital expenditures is approximately  million which includes the investment in our new production facility in saudi arabia expected to come online later this yearour balance sheet and financial position remain strong we ended the quarter with  million of cash on hand and with no bank debt outstanding we closed the multilift acquisition in early july for approximately  million using available cash we remain well positioned and ready to execute our acquisition strategyour weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter was  million shares when we turn profitable on a net income basis the diluted share count will increase to approximately  million shares at the current share price to once again include the impact of optionsnet debt at the end of the second quarter was  million down  million bringing our net debt to total capitalization ratio to interest expense was  million in the second quarter corporate expenses were  million and we now expect corporate expenses to be around  million in the third quarter depreciation and amortization expense was  million for the quarter and should be similar in the third quarterour effective tax rate on the second quarter adjusted operating loss was  we estimate our effective tax rate on normal operations for the remainder of the year will be approximately for more information about our financial results please review the earnings release on our website and with that let me turn the call back over to pradyprady iyyanki forum energy technologies inc  ceo president  director thanks jim forums team is capitalizing on opportunities to market this presenting currently in north america and expanding our operating margins even without any meaningful pricing improvement im pleased with the new marketleading products the team has developed you will see us continue to invest in organic growth initiatives and execute our ma strategy especially in completions and production  infrastructure segmentsthank you for your interest at this point well open the line for questions operator please take the first questionquestions and answersoperator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of george oleary with tph  cogeorge michael oleary tudor pickering holt  co securities inc research division  director oil service research i thought the results on the production  infrastructure segment were particularly interesting just given the magnitude of the move quarteronquarter i realize cooper is in there now so that had something to do with it i wonder if you could just parse out maybe going forward how we should think about the production side versus the infrastructure side are we starting to see some kind of underlying demand growth on the valve side of the business or is the growth going forward still really more production oriented ie kind of us onshore well count oriented how would you guys kind of break that outprady iyyanki forum energy technologies inc  ceo president  director yes thanks george i would say the pi had very strong bookings in revenue in the second quarter i mean let me talk about valves for a second even without the cooper valves contribution in the second quarter they still had the record level of bookings and thats primarily the upstream in north america is up and the midstream in us is either flattish or a little bit up but were gaining market share as theres an infrastructure buildout in basins for transportation gas terminals the liquid pipelines and on the international front both the midstream and downstream is pretty active and were trying to gain market share and thats one of the reasons george why were building this operation in saudi arabia focused on middle east and downstream and were also increasing our presence in the southeast asia to penetrate the midstream and downstream part of the market on the utilities side there are either pipelines being refurbished or there are new pipelines being built and we are maximizing on that so this is primarily a market share gain opportunity for us which were capitalizing on with the exception of riding the wave on the upstream side and on the production equipment side i think the demand is strong and we continue to ramp up on the production equipment sidegeorge michael oleary tudor pickering holt  co securities inc research division  director oil service research great thats very helpful color and then you guys have been a little bit more acquisitive and you talked about generally where youre looking to deploy incremental capital as bidask spreads have compressed i guess when i think about the completions side going forward are acquisitions going to be more focused you think on the downhole tool side of that business or more kind of flow equipment adding onto the pressure pumping offering you guys haveprady iyyanki forum energy technologies inc  ceo president  director yes a good question george i would say on the acquisition side i think our strategy remains intact our  area of focus is completions which includes the surface and also the downhole products and obviously the multilift acquisition we did is consistent with that strategy right on the artificial lift which plays a role both on the completions side and also on the production side and then the second priority is any opportunities we can get on the midstream downstream side would be the second priority but its also the cooper acquisition which we did in the earlier part of the year george so i think our ma strategy is intact i would also say the ma environment is probably friendly in the second half just because the value gap has come down which is primarily the ipo season is coming to an end and the expectations on pricing is getting more reasonable however it is very competitive but i think deals will get done in the second halfgeorge michael oleary tudor pickering holt  co securities inc research division  director oil service research great and then maybe if i could just sneak one more in prady the multilift acquisition is one that seems pretty intriguing to us as there does seem to be a growing trend of esps and esps being in wells over a longer duration than they historically were especially us onshore these kind of highpressure longerlateral horizontal wells given kind of the unique nature of that business to some degree it seems to me that that might be accretive to forums margins and i realize the transaction wasnt super large but would you call that kind of product line within the forum complex accretive to your marginsprady iyyanki forum energy technologies inc  ceo president  director listen we are really excited about multilift george i would say its accretive to the business probably the deal got done at the historic ranges which youve seen us do in the past itll be meaningful for the downhole product line in  its going to move the needle for those guys and again its an ipprotected product the sandguard which is a selfcleaning device without any flow disruptions and also the cyclone product and i think our differentiation in the cyclone product is  there are a lot of different configurations out there and in our case one size fits all and in the case of sandguard which is an ipprotected product the competitive landscape is very favorable to us and the customer saves significant amount of cost than when the pump has a failure because of the sand intrusion into the esp so were really excited about the multilift acquisition and consistent with our acquisition strategy of focused on completionsoperator our next question comes from the line of martin malloy with johnson ricemartin w malloy johnson rice  company llc research division  director of research i had a question on the drilling  subsea segment and maybe if you could talk a little bit more about whats going on there the revenues were relatively flat it looks like quarteroverquarter and the inbounds were down quite a bit and if you could maybe talk about that what youre seeing with the drilling rig land drilling rig upgrade cycle and particularly the mud pumps and how much longer that might lastprady iyyanki forum energy technologies inc  ceo president  director yes yes good question marty i would say on the  let me talk about the consumables and then also about the capital equipment and then ill also talk about the subsea piece on the consumable front our expectation is with the rig count stabilizing or maybe a little bit of a decline some of the active rigs will go into the maintenance mode but they will still need the opex part of the consumables but what we expect to see is less mud pump upgrades in second half compared to the first half however completionweighted products like the centrifugal pumps the inaudible and bearings we expect still good activity on that front but overall we expect the drilling product line to have a decline in the third quarter from a revenue standpoint now fourth quarter there are a few variables there but mostly on the capital equipment side is there are several discussions with customers on upgrading the lowerspec rigs to the higherspec rigs where the content for us could be anywhere from  million to  million and primarily where we come into play is rather than just doing the recertification we are upgrading our catwalks extending the reach and the height and the  psi upgrades and also in some cases the handling tools and the conditionbased monitoring could play a role theres a little bit of uncertainty there on when thats going to materialize but the pipeline on that in the us is pretty good and theres a little bit of uncertainty on the international front but the pipeline on the international front is a little stronger than what it was about  months ago primarily in the middle east and in india and also in north america but more in middle east and in india so on the capital equipment side theres a little bit of uncertainty but if some of that materializes our fourth quarter could be stronger than third quarter but we dont know at this point on the subsea front marty i would say this weve got a great franchise weve got a great team its a bad market on the oil and gas front but in our case its less than  of the portfolio and our target again for this year is ebitda flat at the product line level so it doesnt drag the mother ship down but we are exploring opportunities outside oil and gas and ill be disappointed if we dont announce any orders in the second half of  because there is a pipeline for us outside oil and gas but the oil and gas is pretty weak and the pipeline is pretty much nonexistent on the oil and gas side so we continue to streamline our operations on the subsea and make very selective investments to protect the franchise but again its less than  of the portfoliomartin w malloy johnson rice  company llc research division  director of research okay and then a second question could you talk about any specific product lines where youre seeing the lead time stretch out the most and where you think you have the opportunity to start to have pricing discussions with your customers about increasing pricingprady iyyanki forum energy technologies inc  ceo president  director yes  no great question marty i would say si or stimulation and intervention the pressure pumping part of the portfolio across the board i think i would say demand is very strong as evident from our bookings and also revenue in the last   quarters we are still ramping up fast and its still hand to mouth the lead times are extending and it is providing opportunities for us well from a pricing standpoint and i would say later part of second half at the tail end of second quarter the pricing started materializing not meaningful in second quarter but well start seeing that in the results in the third quarter and fourth quarter thats one of the reasons why we said our second half incrementals on completions will be stronger than what youve seen in the first half but the lead times are getting extended and we are getting pricing opportunities now the other point on the si side is with the significant amount of growth were seeing on the top line and bookings were adding significant amount of people our workforce has increased significantly and theres a little bit of productivity which will catch up in the second half of  right i mean the folks who come new dont get  are not productive right from day  it takes a couple of months for them to be productive so were not seeing the operational productivity yet in si but we do expect to see that in the second half and on top of it the material  the pricing which is materializing which is already in the backlog start materializing in the second half and then the other product line is production equipment it is pretty much hand to mouth and the lead times are extending weve got a very strong backlog going into third quarter and fourth quarter however the pricing on the production equipment is fourth quarter first quarter price right because as youll remember we got the chunky orders in fourth quarter and first quarter which are still flowing to the shop but i would say late fourth quarter well start seeing the pricing materialize through the  to the operations too jimjames whelan harris forum energy technologies inc  cfo and evp yes marty i would also just highlight that similar to production equipment we always talk about our stimulation and intervention business being a bookandship business but given the strength of the demand that weve had in orders weve actually built a backlog there so likewise weve taken orders in the first half of this year and some of those early in the years especially for the power ends that was at pricing that was very aggressive and while weve seen pricing increase until we deliver on the backlog that we now have at these lower prices once thats done well start seeing the benefit of these pricing increases that prady was describing but thats a little bit of a subtle change from what weve said in the past about si just given the level of backlog we have todayoperator and our next question comes from the line of scott gruber with citigroupscott andrew gruber citigroup inc research division  director and senior analyst prady the pickup in middle east demand that you highlighted earlier can you provide some color just across the product spectrum when youre looking at upstream midstream downstream is it primarily midstream and downstream at this point or is some of the upstream orders starting to pick up as wellprady iyyanki forum energy technologies inc  ceo president  director yes i think our initial focus the manufacturing facility were building in saudi arabia will be focused on the midstream and downstream part of the portfolio more particularly in valves and our customers are showing pretty good interest there and also the local content  we meet the local content requirements which also gives us a pricing premium and i think the operation will be active in the fourth quarter of  but fully operational in  but as we go through the process weve got to put other products too in the manufacturing location later part of  and  which would be focused on the completions side and also some of the other product lines on the  like for example some of the subproduct lines in drilling so i think the focus is across the spectrum but initially the focus of the manufacturing shop will be on the midstream and downstream more particularly in valves what i will also say we are gaining momentum we do have commercial presence now than what we had in the past and that commercial team is gaining traction on the completions side and some orders and revenue are already trickling down but the manufacturing location is still here in the usscott andrew gruber citigroup inc research division  director and senior analyst and then how do you think about expanding your capabilities on the rig equipment side do you wait to tie it to the big tenders in the middle east coming into the market have you tried to move ahead and any color you can provide on those bigger tenders and what youre seeing thereprady iyyanki forum energy technologies inc  ceo president  director sure i would say this in the pipeline in the middle east  in fact i would say thats the region which has the strongest pipeline on the capital equipment side whether its kuwait or whether its abu dhabi or its saudi aramco or its even qatar i mean the whole middle east is  the pipeline is pretty strong scott however things are moving to the right theres one middle eastern customer we just recently heard that maybe some tenders could happen in the fourth quarter and our view is probably theyre expecting  theyre waiting for the oil price to go past  and some of those tenders will come into fruition and now we have pretty good installed fleet in middle east from a forum standpoint in fact we have the biggest catwalk installed fleet in the middle east and a pretty good service team in the middle east so i think that part of the business will continue to be strong in the middle east were trying to build up the completions and the production  infrastructure part of the portfolio in the middle east as part of the manufacturing locationscott andrew gruber citigroup inc research division  director and senior analyst got it and if we just take a longerterm view you highlighted the expansion in southeast asia focusing on midstream and in downstream again what do you envision  where do you envision potentially going over the next  years im thinking about the expansion in shale activity in argentina and some of your competitors nov and schlumberger are forecasting a rig upgrade cycle in russia can you just provide some color on where else youre thinking about expanding internationally to take advantage of opportunities as shale goes global and opportunities to upgrade the land rig fleet internationallyprady iyyanki forum energy technologies inc  ceo president  director yes so i think on the pressure pumping side scott our main focus is north america i mean as we mentioned right now were hand to mouth and the demand is strong and we need to ramp up fast so right now i think all the resources and everything is focused in north america and then we can start penetrating canada too but right now our focus right now is in the us and in argentina and china and some of the other countries i mentioned they are still at an early phase i think if we just looked at it from an opportunity standpoint its still small and we are not fully penetrated yet in north america and canada and one of the things we do like is our products are gaining traction in north america some of the new products weve commercialized so theres a lot of market share opportunity for us in us and canada and then also on the international front some of our existing customers will take us there right i mean as they go on the international front some of those pressure pumpers they will take us  and the product will be  weve got to put some service locations there but right now our focus more is in us and north america and in the southeast asia right now with  when the offshore boom was good we had a pretty good installed fleet on onshore and offshore but right now the biggest opportunity we see in far east is on the infrastructure buildout side but its primarily the valves part of the business theres a big market where we dont participate and our supply chain or most of our supply chain is in that part of the world so i think its a lowhanging fruit which we want to take advantage of and as the revenues start coming and as the profitability starts coming from the southeast asia well start building the infrastructure for the rest of the segments toooperator and our next question comes from the line of rob mackenzie with iberia capitalrobert james mackenzie iberia capital partners llc research division  md of equity research i wanted to come back to the subsea product line for a minute in the wake of the technipfmc merger and their decision to standardize going forward on the schilling product line are there any specific legacy schilling customers that you think are ripe to pick off and convert to perry in the next upcycleprady iyyanki forum energy technologies inc  ceo president  director absolutely i think there is an opportunity there rob and i think the closer that tie becomes between the schilling and technip some of our customers will see them as competitors and that does give us the opportunity to penetrate the market on the oil and gas front but i will also say is one of the things we are pleased about our subsea team is we are diversifying outside oil and gas which  whether its the telecom or whether its the defense or whether its the marine research or whether its the wind farm and we think for the next couple of years when the market is down we can still pay the bills and protect the franchise and then once the oil and gas business comes starts from the top off right the base of this business which were going to have outside the oil and gas but absolutely to your point i think that will give us the opportunity to penetrate some of the other customers there are new customers who are also coming onboard and that will also give us the opportunity to penetrate those customersrobert james mackenzie iberia capital partners llc research division  md of equity research great and then on the completions side i guess i understand why pricing takes a while to occur there but im a bit surprised given the strong growth in revenue sequentially that incremental margins and absolute margins therefore werent higher than they were are there some other moving parts there that you can help us to understand thatprady iyyanki forum energy technologies inc  ceo president  director thats a great question well i would say if you look at our growth in the second quarter from a revenue standpoint i mean  segments drove that growth right one is the completions segment and the second one is the pi segment and i want to talk about  specific product lines there which will add more color here is the si and the production equipment growth were strong as part of the revenue growth contribution and si i think jim added some color is on one front we are ramping up significantly just not for the second quarter we were also ramping up for the third quarter and fourth quarter based on the backlog were building and the significant amount of orders we are seeing which is providing  which is causing some productivity issues in the shop because of all the new people coming onboard and also on the pricing front the service customers started getting pricing earlier than us and now were seeing less resistance from the service customers on the pricing discussions as a result we started seeing the price materialize in the tail end of second quarter which will start materializing into the results in third quarter and fourth quarter right and thats why we think our incrementals on the completions side will be much stronger in second half than first half the second point on the  from a color standpoint is production equipment and as you know historically it has been a lowmargin business and we took chunky orders in the fourth quarter and first quarter of last year and the pricing was fourth quarter and first quarter pretty much at the bottom or a little bit higher in the first quarter and that is still flowing through the shop because weve got a very strong backlog in the third quarter pretty much  weve got everything in the backlog for the third quarter right with little of opportunity that we can take on a little bit more work but in the fourth quarter tail end of fourth quarter is when well start realizing the prices which we started quoting in second and more importantly in the third quarter too so a factor of those  production equipment and si pricing materializing in the tail end of second quarter and the absorption productivity issues we had because of all the new peoplec christopher gaut forum energy technologies inc  executive chairman and just to highlight rob when the completions business is at a run rate thats almost doubling every  months with an extremely high growth rate like that and strong demand that we see in the runway in front of us weve got to build for that future demand we see that the markets there so we have been adding costs weve been adding people adding equipment so theres the rampup cost that were seeing here in the second quarter in anticipation of the strong market and the strong orders that were building and so those costs did affect our margins in q but i think youll see the benefit of not only the continued high rate of growth there but better margins later in the year but were just trying to accommodate such a fastgrowing market and thats a challengeprady iyyanki forum energy technologies inc  ceo president  director probably another data point rob we can talk about because one of the things we do feel about is the margin expansion which is happening is if you take our pi equipment out from an incremental standpoint our incrementals are  and without production equipment our incrementals are  right so we are seeing incrementals and as we start getting the price and the cost absorption which cris talked about i think incrementals will be stronger in the second halfrobert james mackenzie iberia capital partners llc research division  md of equity research great thats very helpful and then one final question if i can on the completions segment is there any way for you guys to pull out of that of your numbers in the growth in revenue how much of that is coming from the new oem equipment versus repairing or replacing wornout parts on active equipment in the field alreadyprady iyyanki forum energy technologies inc  ceo president  director yes  no i think its a great question i  to use power end as a data point being a capital equipment i would say probably  newbuilds and  refurbished or replacements and thats what were seeing on the power ends and then as you go down the chain the refurbishment becomes a bigger percentage and the capital equipment becomes a little smaller percentageoperator and our next question comes from the line of marc bianchi with cowenmarc gregory bianchi cowen and company llc research division  md so you talked a lot about the different segments in terms of what the nearterm outlook is and i was hoping we could just sort of review and make sure ive got it all down and im just going to run through this and maybe you can tell me where maybe if theres anything youd update or change it sounds like drilling possibly down a little bit in the third quarter subsea flattish completions growing pretty  at a pretty healthy pace and pi about flat would you agree with that or how would you change thatprady iyyanki forum energy technologies inc  ceo president  director ds i think youre right on in the third quarter completions yes strong growth pi strong growthc christopher gaut forum energy technologies inc  executive chairman yes good fundamentals there marc and as you can tell from the high booktobill rate there for bookandship businessprady iyyanki forum energy technologies inc  ceo president  director but the di  ds decline and then the completions and production  infrastructure significant growthmarc gregory bianchi cowen and company llc research division  md okay great and then in terms of the margin leverage there completions at the top and then how about between ds and piprady iyyanki forum energy technologies inc  ceo president  director i think in the case of ds since the revenue is going down right i think well manage the cost and streamlining the operations but i think whats going to move the incrementals for us is the completions and on the production  infrastructure side as we talked about is the production equipment has always been a lowmargin business so even though they will have margin expansion they cannot move the needle for usmarc gregory bianchi cowen and company llc research division  md okay and its nice to hear that youre getting some pricing traction in completions how much have you seen so far how much is kind of baked into the outlook for the third quarter im curious if you could provide some more colorprady iyyanki forum energy technologies inc  ceo president  director for competitive reasons obviously marc we dont want to share that however i can add some color to it is i would say by no means its a broadbased price recovery across all the segments where we are seeing price opportunities is in si the pressure pumping part of the portfolio and a little bit on the production equipment side right but were not seeing pricing opportunities on the downhole products however we are commercializing some new products for example on the  on our global tubing joint venture we have commercialized our new quencher product which is the inaudible and obviously thats much more reliable and durable and we would expect that the pricing to be better than the old coils but the new products are driving the pricing in the downhole front bottom line is i think its si and its the production equipment which is again a lowmargin businessoperator and our next question comes from the line of sean meakim with jpmorgansean christopher meakim jp morgan chase  co research division  senior equity research analyst i was hoping you could just drill on the valves a little bit you highlighted a good bit about the downstream opportunity particularly some middle east and asia pac it seems like theres tons of runway there but how about in the us weve seen so many of these petrochemical projects start to move forward it seems like theres a lot of opportunity here as well maybe you could size the  a little bit for us and maybe give us a little more of a sense of what the mix looks like for your us valves franchiseprady iyyanki forum energy technologies inc  ceo president  director yes well some of that marc sic sean is already reflected in the valves bookings and thats one of the reasons why we had a record quarter im not including cooper and i would say the infrastructure buildout continues to happen whether its for the basins for transportation or gas terminals or liquid pipelines the downstream in us is down the refineries in the petrochemical part of the product line  part of the segment is down in north america but not internationally internationally the downstream is pretty buoyant and so is the midstream part of the portfolio so again its a big market and we have a small market share so i would say the prospects for our valves business is back on growth track and were excited about our growth opportunities in valves and whether its midstream or downstream on the international front which is all upside for us or the market share opportunities in the us and were also riding the upstream being up in north americac christopher gaut forum energy technologies inc  executive chairman and thats positive in the valves business from a mix standpoint that that greater contribution from the upstream and some from the midstream relative to the downstream is positive for margins from a mix standpointprady iyyanki forum energy technologies inc  ceo president  director and probably another point which is worth mentioning is the cooper acquisition was a strategic acquisition and cooper is pretty much on the midstream and the downstream part of the portfolio and that exposes the power market and also the chemical  the petrochemical market which were talking about and a lot of opportunity there on the cooper side toooperator our last question comes from the line of john watson from simmons  companyjohn h watson simmons  company international research division  analyst research to follow up on an earlier question prady in drilling could you provide us any idea surrounding the number of  psi and third mud pump upgrades formally completed in the first half and maybe the potential number of rig upgrades moving forwardprady iyyanki forum energy technologies inc  ceo president  director yes probably there are some more moving elements still john but i think probably the guidance we can give is second half for sure starting third quarter we do see  from a run rate standpoint we do see a decline in the mud pump upgrades and more in the fourth quarter because we do have some in the backlog i think our opportunity would be on some of this capital equipment discussions we are having with the customers where they may also need  psi upgrades pretty much rare were already hearing in the marketplaces customers are trying to take a  horsepower rig and upgrade that to the latest greatest spec from a rig standpoint which gives us the opportunity to not only recertify our catwalk but also upgrade it to the latest spec and then it could provide opportunities in the handling tools and conditionbased monitoring and that could be a content anywhere from  million to  million so how much of that will offset the mud pump decline we dont know at this point of time but as we said if some of those things start materializing i think the fourth quarter could be a little stronger than q but we dont know at this point of timejohn h watson simmons  company international research division  analyst research right okay and then on the power end front as of the q call i think annualized orders were around  today its closer to  how much might that pace accelerate in the back half of the year could we be around  million horsepower for the full yearprady iyyanki forum energy technologies inc  ceo president  director i think the run rate is obviously  if you look at the run rate it feels like that but  and it also depends on how much more frac fleets will come into the marketplace between now and end of the year john i would say listen we had  million horsepower by the  i think last  when we had the last call and right now we have a  horsepower of power ends but the run rate is  looks  it feels like  million but it also depends how much more frac fleet theyre going to put in the marketplace our expectation is probably it will land somewhere between  million to  million horsepower if we read right the same things which you guys read but certainly we have a shot towards thatc christopher gaut forum energy technologies inc  executive chairman and john its probably fair to say at this point that the easy stuff to be put to work went to work a while ago and anything thats put out to work there now whether refurbished or obviously new will require a new power end so any additions from this point do require new power ends for those thingsprady iyyanki forum energy technologies inc  ceo president  director its a great point right once we go past the  million  million horsepower they will refurbishing more with new versus trying to repair themjohn h watson simmons  company international research division  analyst research well i think you all will get to  million for whatever thats worth and then one last unrelated followup jim on the free cash flow guidance it seems like theres been a bit of a change from positive in the back half to positive in early  can you provide any additional color surrounding that change and maybe color around commodity price or rig count thats incorporated into that guidancejames whelan harris forum energy technologies inc  cfo and evp sure so john one of the big changes is when we gave the guidance on the second half we were expecting that large tax refund to come in the second half and just through the hard work of our tax department and the other folks we were able to get it in june so that was a  million move into  thats why we were cashflow positive in the second quarter even though we had given guidance that we expected negative but as we look at the second half cris described as were growing these startup costs that were putting in place with labor and others as were ramping up the same is true for our inventories so we are continuing to purchase and invest in materials so that we can ramp up production to meet what we expect to be the demand and were still obviously at a low base of earnings and so the confluence of still low ebitda while investing in rapid growth is whats driving us into the negative cash flow and once we work through that even if growth continues well be able to do as we have historically grow positively with positive free cash flow and still cover those investments its just theres a bridge here in the second half that were hedging a little bitprady iyyanki forum energy technologies inc  ceo president  director thanks jim thanks for your interest  segments the completions segment and the production  infrastructure segments are  strong tailwinds for us going into second half and if we look at our bookings about  of the bookings came from those  segments and were excited about that and well talk more at the next investor call thanks for your interestoperator ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in todays
