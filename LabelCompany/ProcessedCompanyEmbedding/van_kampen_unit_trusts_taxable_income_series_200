each year divided by the unit price estimated long term return shows the estimated return over the estimated life of your trust these estimates are as of the opening of business on the date of deposit and will vary thereafter we base this estimate on an average of the bond yields over their estimated life this estimate also reflects the sales charge and estimated expenses we derive the average yield for your portfolio by weighting each bonds yield by its value and estimated life unlike estimated current return estimated long term return accounts for maturities discounts and premiums of the bonds these estimates show a comparison rather than a prediction of returns no return calculation can predict your actual return your actual return may vary from these estimates prospectus part i

kampen investments investment objective the trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital principal investment strategy the trust invests in a portfolio of longterm bonds insurance guaranteeing the timely payment when due of all principal and interest on the bonds in the trust has been obtained from a bond insurance company in selecting bonds for the trust the sponsor considered the following factors among others o the bonds must have a standard  poors rating of aaa or a moodys investors service inc rating of aaa o the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity o the current income provided by the bonds o the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer and o the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk the portfolio generally consists of bonds maturing approximately  to  years from the date of deposit principal risks as with all investments you can lose money by investing in the trust the trust also might not perform as well as you expect this can happen for reasons such as these o bond prices will fluctuate the value of your investment may fall over time o the value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates in general rise no one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future o a bond issuer or insurer may be unable to make interest andor principal payment in the future o the financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop resulting in a reduction in the value of your units this may occur at any point in time including during the primary offering period o a bond issuer might prepay or call a bond before its stated maturity if this happens the trust will distribute the principal to you but future interest distributions will fall a bonds call price could be less than the price the trust paid for the bond if enough bonds are called the trust could terminate earlier than expected o the trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer this makes the trust less diversified and subject to greater risk than a more diversified portfolio the types of bond in the portfolio are listed under portfolio diversification on the next page o the trust is considered to be concentrated in bonds of issuers located in california these issuers make up approximately  of the principal amount of the bonds the financial condition of california is affected by various national and local economic social and environmental policies and conditions and may have an effect on the value of units o we do not actively manage the portfolio except in limited circumstances the trust will hold the same bonds even if the market value declines summary of essential financial information as of

and to preserve capital by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of longterm bonds the objective of an intermediateterm trust is to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of intermediateterm bonds the objective of a laddered trust is to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital by investing

selecting bonds for each trust the sponsor considered the following factors among others a with respect to insured trusts the bonds must have a standard  poors rating of aaa or a moodys investor service inc moodys rating of aaa and with respect to all other trusts the bonds must have a standard  poors rating of at least bbb a moodys rating of at least baa or if not rated credit characteristics sufficiently similar to those of comparable bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by a trust in the opinion of the sponsor b the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity c the current income provided by the bonds d the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer e the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk after the date of deposit a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the date of deposit neither event requires elimination of a bond from a trust but may be considered in the sponsors determination as to whether or not to direct the trustee to dispose of the bond see trust administrationportfolio administration in particular the ratings of the bonds in a longterm investment grade trust or an investment grade trust could fall below investment grade ie below bbb or baa during the trusts life and the trust could continue to hold the bonds see the trustsrisk factors insurance guaranteeing the timely payment when due of all principal and interest on the bonds in an insured trust has been obtained from a bond insurance company for information relating to insurance on the bonds see insurance on the bonds in an insured trust neither the public offering price nor any evaluation of units for purposes of repurchases or redemptions reflects any element of value for the insurance obtained by an insured trust unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default see public offeringunit price in order for bonds to be eligible for insurance they must have credit characteristics which would qualify them for at least the standard  poors rating of bbb or at least the moodys investors service inc rating of baa which in brief represent the lowest ratings for securities of investment grade see description of ratings in the information supplement insurance is not a substitute for the basic credit of an issuer but supplements the existing credit and provides additional security if an issue is accepted for insurance a noncancelable policy for the prompt payment of interest and principal on the bonds when due is issued by the insurer a monthly premium is paid by a trust for the insurance obtained by it the trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance from a portfolio insurer in connection with the sale of a bond insured under the insurance policy obtained from the respective portfolio insurer by an insured trust upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from the proceeds of the sale of such bond accordingly any bond in an insured trust is eligible to be sold on an insured basis all bonds insured by a portfolio insurer or by a preinsured bond insurer receive a aaa rating by standard  poors standard  poors describes securities it rates aaa as having the highest rating assigned by standard  poors to a debt obligation capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong see insurance on the bonds in an insured trust risk factors all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of bonds in your trust you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the bonds falls the value of your units will also fall you can lose money by investing in a trust no one can guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period the information supplement which is available upon request contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price or below the par value market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a bonds issuer or insurer perceptions of the issuer or insurer or ratings on a bond even though the supervisor supervises your portfolio you should remember that no one manages your portfolio your trust will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest rates increase bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall bonds with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes credit risk is the risk that a bonds issuer or insurer is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or calls a bond before its stated maturity an issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original purpose if an issuer calls a bond your trust will distribute the principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall you might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield a bonds call price could be less than the price your trust paid for the bond and could be below the bonds par value this means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your units if enough bonds in your trust are called your trust could terminate early some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur such as certain changes in tax laws the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used and various other events the call provisions are described in general terms in prospectus part i additional discussion of call provisions appears in the information supplement bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating agency decreases the bonds rating bond concentration risk is the risk that your trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of bond when a certain type of bond makes up  or more of a trust the trust is considered to be concentrated in that bond type the different bond types are described in the following sections reduced diversification risk is the risk that your trust will become smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold are called or mature this could increase your risk of loss and increase your share of trust expenses liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in the bond is limited or absent no one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the

principal and interest revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority they are not supported by the issuers general power to levy taxes the risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the related project falters because that income is the only source of payment all of the following bonds are revenue bonds airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger offerings this reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities the types of financing projects that these obligations support vary certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease obligation lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these bonds these payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations for the lease payments a governmental body cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments but governments typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets if a government fails to budget for or make lease payments sufficient funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from hospitals and hospital systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels demand for services competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations the need to reduce costs government regulation costs of malpractice insurance and claims and government financial assistance such as medicare and medicaid higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges these issuers derive revenues from tuition dormitories grants and endowments these issuers face problems related to declines in the number of collegeage individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees uncertainty of continued federal grants state funding or donations and government legislation or regulation industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring building or improving industrial projects private corporations usually operate these projects the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project revenues generated by the project expenses of the project and environmental or other regulatory restrictions multifamily housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on multiple family residences retirement housing or housing projects for low to moderateincome families these bonds are generally prepayable at any time it is likely that their life will be less than their stated maturity the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on such factors as rental income occupancy levels operating expenses mortgage default rates taxes government regulations and appropriation of subsidies other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from mental health facilities nursing homes and intermediate care facilities these bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general risks public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring leasing building or improving public buildings such as offices recreation facilities convention centers police stations correctional institutions and parking garages the ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments on the facility user

make payments on these bonds depends primarily on ad valorem taxes these issuers may also face problems related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education financing retail electricgastelephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for these utilities competition government regulation and rate approvals overhead expenses and the cost of fuels single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on single family residences single family residences generally include one to fourfamily dwellings these bonds are similar to multifamily housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a municipality such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds these bonds are similar to general obligation bonds unlike general obligation bonds however the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay these bonds instead the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to pay these bonds if the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal a municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds an inability to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public transit systems ports highways turnpikes bridges and other transportation systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on variations in use the degree of government subsidization competition from other forms of transportation and increased costs port authorities derive revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities these fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air rail and truck transportation increased fuel costs alternative transportation modes and competition from tollfree bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers that operate bridges roads or tunnels waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from resource recovery facilities these facilities process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity these issuers face problems such as costs and delays due to environmental concerns effects of conservation and recycling destruction or condemnation of a project void or unenforceable contracts changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect operation of a project water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive

water supplies and nogrowth zoning ordinances these issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal issuers wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from selling electricity to other utilities the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for electric utilities competition overhead expenses and government regulation and rate approvals consumer product and retail issuers your trust may invest significantly in companies that manufacture or sell various consumer products general risks of these companies include the general state of the economy intense competition and consumer spending trends a decline in the economy which results in a reduction of consumers disposable income can negatively impact spending habits competitiveness in the retail industry will require large capital outlays for the installation of automated checkout equipment to control inventory track the sale of items and gauge the success of sales campaigns retailers who sell their products over the internet have the potential to access more consumers but will require sophisticated technology to remain competitive financial services companies your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by financial services companies any negative impact on this industry will have a greater impact on the value of units than on a portfolio diversified over several industries you should understand the risks of this industry before you invest banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates portfolio concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans and competition from new entrants in their fields of business in addition banks and their holding companies are extensively regulated at both the federal and state level and may be adversely affected by increased regulations banks will face increased competition from nontraditional lending sources as regulatory changes such as the recently enacted grammleachbliley financial services overhaul legislation permit new entrants to offer various financial products technological advances such as the internet allow these nontraditional lending sources to cut overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer data banks are already facing tremendous pressure from mutual funds brokerage firms and other financial service providers in the competition to furnish services that were traditionally offered by banks companies engaged in investment management and brokerdealer activities are subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceeds the volatility of the securities markets in general adverse changes in the direction of the securities markets investor confidence equity transaction volume the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability of these companies additionally competitive pressures including increased competition with new and existing competitors the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage industries companies involved in investment management and brokerdealer activities are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and selfregulatory organizations and changes in laws regulations or rules or in the interpretation of such laws regulations and rules could adversely affect such companies companies involved in the insurance reinsurance and risk management industry underwrite sell or distribute property casualty and business insurance many factors affect insurance reinsurance and risk management company profits including interest rate movements the imposition of premium rate caps a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings competition and pressure to compete globally weather catastrophes or other disasters and the effects of client mergers already extensively regulated insurance companies profits may be adversely affected by increased government regulations or tax law changes telecommunications companies your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by telecommunications companies these companies are subject to substantial governmental regulation for example the united states government and state governments regulate permitted rates of return and the kinds of services that a company may offer this industry has experienced substantial deregulation in recent years deregulation may lead to fierce competition for market share and can have a negative impact on certain companies recent federal legislation governing the united states telecommunications industry remains subject to judicial review and additional interpretation which may adversely affect the companies whose securities are held by your trust competitive pressures are intense and telecommunications stocks can experience rapid volatility certain telecommunications products may become outdated very rapidly a companys performance can be hurt if the company fails to keep pace with technological advances several recent highprofile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of telecommunications companies high debt loads that were accumulated during the industry growth spurt of the s are catching up to the industry causing debt and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment at the same time demand for some telecommunications services has fallen sharply as several key markets have become oversaturated some local customers have switched to substitute providers and technologies and corporate profits and the economy generally remain weak to meet increasing competition companies may have to commit substantial capital particularly in the formulation of new products and services using new technologies as a result many companies have been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce outsourcing consolidating andor closing existing facilities and divesting low selling product lines furthermore certain companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial results and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny due to these and other factors the risk level of owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased substantially and may continue to rise certain smaller companies in the portfolio may involve greater risk than larger established issuers smaller companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources their securities may trade in lower volumes than larger companies as a result the prices of these securities may fluctuate more than the prices of other issuers more about the bonds in addition to describing the purpose of the bonds other information about the bonds is also listed in the portfolio in prospectus part i this information relates to other characteristics of the bonds this section briefly describes some of these characteristics original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their face or par value these bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value in a stable interest rate environment the market value of these bonds tends to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach maturity the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond these bonds do not pay any current interest during their life if an investor owns this type of bond the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bonds par value at maturity the price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current interest payments the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value when as and if issued bonds are bonds that trade before they are actually issued this means that the sponsor can only deliver them to your trust when as and if the bonds are actually issued delivery of these bonds may be delayed or may not occur interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to your trust until the sponsor delivers the bond to the trust you may have to adjust your tax basis if the sponsor delivers any of these bonds after the expected delivery date any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued between the time you purchased your units and the delivery of the bonds to your trust this could lower your first year estimated current return you may experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase units even though your trust has not yet received them no fdic guarantee an investment in your trust is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency estimated current and longterm returns  the estimated current returns and the estimated longterm returns as of the date of deposit are set forth on the cover of prospectus part i estimated current return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price the estimated net annual interest income per unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of your trust and with the principal prepayment redemption maturity exchange or sale of bonds the public offering price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds accordingly there is no assurance that the present estimated current return will be realized in the future estimated longterm return is calculated using a formula which  takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values yields which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements of the bonds and  takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with units since the value and estimated retirements of the bonds and the expenses of your trust will change there is no assurance that the present estimated longterm return will be realized in the future the estimated current return and estimated longterm return are expected to differ because the calculation of estimated longterm return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while the estimated current return calculation includes only net annual interest income and public offering price in order to acquire certain bonds it may be necessary for the sponsor or trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the sponsor on the date of deposit this cash may exceed the interest which would accrue to the first settlement date the trustee has agreed to pay for any amounts necessary to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become available from interest payments on the related bonds public offering  general units are offered at the public offering price during the initial offering period the public offering price is based on the aggregate offering price of the bonds the sales charge described below cash if any in the principal account and accrued interest if any the sales charge for an intermediateterm trust is equal to  of the public offering price per unit  of the aggregate offering price of the bonds the sales charge for a laddered trust is equal to  of the public offering price per unit  of the aggregate offering price of the bonds and the sales charge for a longterm trust is equal to  of the public offering price per unit  of the aggregate offering price of the bonds after the initial public offering period the secondary market public offering price is based on the bid prices of the bonds the sales charge described below cash if any in the principal account and accrued interest if any the actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may differ slightly from the sales charges shown herein due to rounding that occurs in the calculation of the public offering price and in the number of units purchased the minimum purchase in the primary and secondary market is one unit certain brokerdealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing unit purchases the secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the following table based upon the estimated longterm return life eltr life of your trusts portfolio eltr life sales charge                                            to   the eltr life represents the

financial professionals responsibility to alert the sponsor of any discount when you purchase units before you purchase units you must also inform your brokerdealer of your qualification for any

levels you may combine purchases of units of a trust offered in this prospectus with purchases of units of any other van kampensponsored unit investment trust in the initial offering period including

for the purposes of calculating the applicable quantity discount level the reduced sales charge levels will also be applicable to a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing units for a single trust estate including multiple trusts created under a single estate or fiduciary account to be eligible for aggregation as described in this paragraph all purchases must be made on the same day through a single brokerdealer or selling agent you must inform your brokerdealer of any combined purchases before your purchase to be eligible for a reduced sales charge letter of intentfor purposes of

purchases will be held in escrow by the trustee pending completion of these purchases all distributions on units held in escrow will be credited to the unitholders account if total purchases prior to the expiration of the letter of intent period equal or exceed the amount specified in a unitholders letter of intent the units held in escrow will be transferred to the unitholders account a unitholder who purchases units during the letter of intent period in excess of the number of units specified in a unitholders letter of intent the amount of which would cause the unitholder to be eligible to receive an additional sales charge reduction will be allowed such additional sales charge reduction on the purchase of units which caused the unitholder to reach such new breakpoint level and on all additional purchases of units during the letter of intent period if the total purchases are less than the amount specified the unitholder involved must pay the sponsor an amount equal to the difference between the amounts paid for these purchases and the amounts which would have been paid if the higher sales charge had been applied the unitholder will however be entitled to any reduced sales charge qualified for by reaching any lower breakpoint level if the unitholder does not pay the additional amount within  days after request by the sponsor or the unitholders securities representative the sponsor will instruct the trustee to redeem an appropriate number of the escrowed units to meet the required payment by establishing a letter of intent a unitholder irrevocably appoints the sponsor as attorney to give instructions to redeem any or all of the unitholders escrowed units with full power of substitution in the premises a unitholder or his securities representative must notify the sponsor whenever the unitholder makes a purchase of units that he wishes to be counted towards the intended amount fee accounts a portion of the sales charge is waived for certain accounts described in this paragraph purchases by these accounts are subject only to the portion of the sales charge that is retained by the sponsor please refer to the section called fee

periodic fees for brokerage services financial planning investment advisory or asset management services or provide such services in connection with the establishment of an investment account for which a comprehensive wrap fee charge wrap fee is imposed fee accounts if the units are purchased for a fee account and the trust is subject to a wrap fee ie the trust is wrap fee eligible the sponsor

employees to participate in this employee discount program are eligible for the discounts unit price the public offering price of units will vary from the amounts stated under summary of essential financial information in prospectus part i in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds the price of units on the date of deposit was determined by adding the applicable sales charge to the aggregate offering price of the bonds and dividing the sum by the number of units outstanding this price determination was made on the basis of an evaluation of the bonds prepared by the evaluator during the initial offering period the evaluator will value the bonds as of the evaluation time on days the new york stock exchange is open for business and will adjust the public offering price of units accordingly the evaluation time is the close of trading on the new york stock exchange on each day that the exchange is open for trading provided however on the date of deposit the evaluation time will be the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange or the time the registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission becomes effective if later the secondary market public offering price per unit will be equal to the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the applicable secondary market sales charge and dividing the sum by the number of units outstanding for secondary market purposes this computation will be made by the evaluator as of the evaluation time for each day on which any unit is tendered for redemption and as necessary the offering price of bonds may be expected to average approximately  more than the bid price the public offering price per unit will be effective for all orders received prior to the evaluation time on each business day orders received by the sponsor prior to the evaluation time and orders received by authorized financial professionals prior to the evaluation time that are properly transmitted to the sponsor by the time designated by the sponsor are priced based on the date of receipt orders received by the sponsor after the evaluation time and orders received by authorized financial professionals after the evaluation time or orders received by such persons that are not transmitted to the sponsor until after the time designated by the sponsor are priced based on the date of the next determined public offering price per unit provided they are received timely by the sponsor on such date it is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to transmit orders received by them to the sponsor so they will be received in a timely manner the aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of bid prices or offering prices as is appropriate a on the basis of current market prices obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by your trust b if these prices are not available on the basis of current market prices for comparable bonds c by causing the value of the bonds to be determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluation quoting or appraising comparable bonds or d by any combination of the above market prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate with changes in market interest rates unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of default the evaluator will not attribute any value to the insurance obtained by your trust the evaluator will consider in its evaluation of bonds which are in default in payment of principal or interest or in the sponsors opinion in significant risk of default the defaulted bonds the value of any insurance guaranteeing interest and principal payments the value of the insurance will be equal to the difference between i the market value of defaulted bonds assuming the exercise of the right to obtain permanent insurance less the insurance premiums and related expenses attributable to the purchase of permanent insurance and ii the market value of defaulted bonds not covered by permanent insurance in addition the evaluator will consider the ability of a portfolio insurer to meet its commitments under any insurance policy including commitments to issue permanent insurance no value has been ascribed to insurance obtained by your trust if any as of the date of this prospectus a person will become the owner of units on the date of settlement provided payment has been received cash if any made available to the sponsor prior to the date of settlement for the purchase of units may be used in the sponsors business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the sponsor subject to the limitations of the securities exchange act of  accrued interest accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on securities which generally is paid semiannually although your trust accrues interest daily because of this your trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee for this reason with respect to sales settling after the first settlement date the proportionate share of accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the public offering price of units unitholders will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on their units on the next distribution date in an effort to reduce the accrued interest which would have to be paid by unitholders the trustee will advance the amount of accrued interest to the sponsor as the unitholder of record as of the first settlement date consequently the accrued interest added to the public offering price of units will include only accrued interest from the first settlement date to the date of settlement less any distributions from the interest account after the first settlement date because of the varying interest payment dates of the bonds accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest actually received by your trust and distributed to unitholders if a unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his units he will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the accrued interest from the purchaser of his units unit distribution units will be distributed to the public by underwriters brokerdealers and others at the public offering price plus accrued interest the sponsor intends to qualify units for sale in a number of states during the

this section summarizes some of the main us federal income tax consequences of owning units of a trust this section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust this may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor trust status the trust intends to qualify as a regulated investment company under the federal tax laws if the trust qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law the trust generally will not pay federal income taxes distributions trust distributions are generally taxable after the end of each year you will receive a tax statement that separates your trusts distributions into two categories ordinary income distributions and capital gains dividends ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your shares to determine your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends you must calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of your other taxable transactions as described below in addition the trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you the tax status of your distributions from your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional shares or receive them in cash the income from your trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge if any the tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year dividends received deduction a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to dividends received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies sale or redemption of units if you sell or redeem your units you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you receive in the transaction your tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units capital gains and losses if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  generally  for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets these capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years beginning before january   for later periods if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally   for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets the  rate is reduced to  and the  rate is reduced to  for longterm capital gains from most property acquired after december   with a holding period of more than five years net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your unit at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be recharacterized as longterm capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations exchanges if you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over into a future series of the trust the exchange would generally be considered a sale for federal income tax purposes inkind distributions under certain circumstances as described in this prospectus you may receive an inkind distribution of trust assets when you redeem your units this distribution will be treated as a sale for federal income tax purposes and you will generally recognize gain or loss generally based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash received the internal revenue service could however assert that a loss could not be currently deducted deductibility of trust expenses expenses incurred and deducted by your trust will generally not be treated as income taxable to you in some cases however you may be required to treat your portion of these trust expenses as income in these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted gross income expenses  general the trustee will periodically deduct from the interest account and to the extent funds are not sufficient therein from the principal account amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the trusts the trustee also may withdraw from these accounts such amounts if any as it deems necessary to establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out

sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any of the bonds consumer product and retail issuers the trust may invest significantly in issuers that manufacture or sell consumer products the profitability of these companies will be affected by various factors including the general state of the economy and consumer spending trends in the past there have been major changes in the retail environment due to the declaration of bankruptcy by some of the major corporations involved in the retail industry particularly the department store segment the continued viability of the retail industry will depend on the industrys ability to adapt and to compete in changing economic and social conditions to attract and retain capable management and to finance expansion weakness in the banking or real estate industry a recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in employment growth less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real disposable personal income growth could result in significant pressure on both consumer wealth and consumer confidence adversely affecting consumer spending habits in addition competitiveness of the retail industry will require large capital outlays for investment in the installation of automated checkout equipment to control inventory to track the sale of individual items and to gauge the success of sales campaigns increasing employee and retiree benefit costs may also have an adverse effect on the industry in many sectors of the retail industry competition may be fierce due to market saturation converging consumer tastes and other factors because of these factors and the recent increase in trade opportunities with other countries american retailers are now entering global markets which entail added risks such as sudden weakening of foreign economies difficulty in adapting to local conditions and constraints and added research costs financial services companies the trust may invest in issuers within the bank and financial services sector in general banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates portfolio concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans and competition from new entrants in their fields of business banks are highly dependent on net interest margin recently bank profits have come under pressure as net interest margins have contracted but volume gains have been strong in both commercial and consumer products there is no certainty that such conditions will continue banks had received significant consumer mortgage fee income as a result of activity in mortgage and refinance markets as initial home purchasing and refinancing activity subsided as a result of increasing interest rates and other factors this income diminished economic conditions in the real estate markets which have been weak in the past can have a substantial effect upon banks because they generally have a portion of their assets invested in loans secured by real estate banks and their holding companies are subject to extensive federal regulation and when such institutions are statechartered to state regulation as well such regulations impose strict capital requirements and limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks may pursue furthermore bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and may substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular institution if deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such institution or the safety of the federal deposit insurance fund regulatory actions such as increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to banks and increases in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic can negatively impact earnings and the ability of a company to pay dividends neither federal insurance of deposits nor governmental regulations however insures the solvency or profitability of banks or their holding companies or insures against any risk of investment in the securities issued by such institutions the statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of banks and their holding companies have increased significantly and have undergone substantial change in recent years to a great extent these changes are embodied in the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act enacted in august  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  and the regulations promulgated under these laws many of the regulations promulgated pursuant to these laws have only recently been finalized and their impact on the business financial condition and prospects of the securities in the trusts portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty the recently enacted grammleachbliley financialservices overhaul legislation will allow banks securities firms and insurance companies to form onestop financial conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to investors this legislation will likely result in increased merger activity and heightened competition among existing and new participants in the field legislation to liberalize interstate banking has recently been signed into law under the legislation banks will be able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in any state one year after the legislations enactment since mid banks have been allowed to turn existing banks into branches consolidation is likely to continue the securities and exchange commission and the financial accounting standards board require the expanded use of market value accounting by banks and have imposed rules requiring market accounting for investment securities held in trading accounts or available for sale adoption of additional such rules may result in increased volatility in the reported health of the industry and mandated regulatory intervention to correct such problems additional legislative and regulatory changes may be forthcoming for example the bank regulatory authorities have proposed substantial changes to the community reinvestment act and fair lending laws rules and regulations and there can be no certainty as to the effect if any that such changes would have on the bonds in the trusts portfolio in addition from time to time the deposit insurance system is reviewed by congress and federal regulators and proposed reforms of that system could among other things further restrict the ways in which deposited moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount or number of deposits insured for any depositor such reforms could reduce profitability as investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited and as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits banks face significant competition from other financial institutions such as mutual funds credit unions mortgage banking companies and insurance companies and increased competition may result from legislative broadening of regional and national interstate banking powers among other benefits such legislation allows banks and bank holding companies to acquire across previously prohibited state lines and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into one unit neither the sponsor nor any underwriter makes any prediction as to what if any manner of bank regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or what ultimate effect such actions might have on the trusts portfolio the federal bank holding company act of  generally prohibits a bank holding company from  acquiring directly or indirectly more than  of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company  acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company  acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank or  merging or consolidating with another bank holding company without first obtaining federal reserve board frb approval in considering an application with respect to any such transaction the frb is required to consider a variety of factors including the potential anticompetitive effects of the transaction the financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting institutions the managerial resources of the resulting institution the convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve the record of performance of each combining organization under the community reinvestment act and the equal credit opportunity act and the prospective availability to the frb of information appropriate to determine ongoing regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws in addition the federal change in bank control act and various state laws impose limitations on the ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks or bank holding companies the frb has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies in the policy statement the frb expressed its view that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that would weaken its financial health such as by borrowing the frb also may impose limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of certain applications including applications for approval of mergers and acquisitions neither the sponsor nor any underwriter makes any prediction as to the effect if any such laws will have on the bonds or whether such approvals if necessary will be obtained companies engaged in the investment management industry are subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates and competition from new entrants in their fields of business adverse changes in the direction of the stock market investor confidence equity transaction volume the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability as well as the stock prices of these companies additionally competitive pressures including increased competition with new and existing competitors the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage industries companies involved in the investment management industry are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and selfregulatory organizations and changes in laws regulations or rules or in the interpretation of such laws regulations and rules could adversely affect such companies companies involved in the insurance reinsurance and risk management industry underwrite sell or distribute property casualty and business insurance many factors affect insurance reinsurance and risk management company profits including but not limited to interest rate movements the imposition of premium rate caps a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings competition and pressure to compete globally weather catastrophes or other disasters and the effects of client mergers individual companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the inability to collect from reinsurance carriers insurance companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation including the imposition of maximum rate levels which may not be adequate for some lines of business proposed or potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies policy sales tax obligations and profitability in addition to the foregoing profit margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of traditional businesses new competitors capital expenditures on new technology and the pressure to compete globally in addition to the normal risks of business companies involved in the insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors including those applicable to regulated insurance companies such as o the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves and the fact that ultimate losses could materially exceed established loss reserves which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition o the fact that insurance companies have experienced and can be expected in the future to experience catastrophic losses which could have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions results of operations and cash flow o the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment patterns caused by new claim settlement practices o the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus particularly in light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state insurance regulatory authorities and in order to maintain acceptable financial strength or claimspaying ability ratings o the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies are subject and various regulatory and other legal actions o the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the value of an insurance companys investment portfolio and on the attractiveness of certain of its products and o the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance and the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables the state insurance regulatory framework has during recent years come under increased federal scrutiny and certain state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that alter and in many cases increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company systems further the national association of insurance commissioners naic and state insurance regulators are reexamining existing laws and regulations specifically focusing on insurance companies interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws in addition congress and certain federal agencies have investigated the condition of the insurance industry in the united states to determine whether to promulgate additional federal regulation the sponsor is unable to predict whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the nature or scope of regulation of the insurance industry or what effect if any such legislation would have on the industry all insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain investment categories failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause nonconforming investments to be treated as nonadmitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and in some instances would require divestiture telecommunications issuers because your trust may be concentrated in bonds issued by telecommunications companies the value of the units may be susceptible to factors affecting the telecommunications industry the telecommunications industry is subject to governmental regulation and the products and services of telecommunications companies may be subject to rapid obsolescence these factors could affect the value of units telephone companies in the united states for example are subject to both state and federal regulations affecting permitted rates of returns and the kinds of services that may be offered certain types of companies represented in a portfolio are engaged in fierce competition for a share of the market of their products as a result competitive pressures are intense and the stocks are subject to rapid price volatility several recent highprofile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of telecommunications companies high debt loads that were accumulated during the industry growth spurt of the s are catching up to the industry causing debt and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment at the same time demand for some telecommunications services has fallen sharply as several key markets have become oversaturated some local customers have switched to substitute providers and technologies and corporate profits and the economy generally remain weak to meet increasing competition companies may have to commit substantial capital particularly in the formulation of new products and services using new technologies as a result many companies have been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce outsourcing consolidating andor closing existing facilities and divesting low selling product lines furthermore certain companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial results and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny due to these and other factors the risk level of owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased substantially and may continue to rise while a portfolio may concentrate on the securities of established suppliers of traditional telecommunication products and services a trust may also invest in bonds of smaller telecommunications companies which may benefit from the development of new products and services these smaller companies may present greater opportunities for capital appreciation and may also involve greater risk than large established issuers such smaller companies may have limited product lines market or financial resources and their securities may trade less frequently and in limited volume than the securities of larger more established companies as a result the prices of the securities of such smaller companies may fluctuate to a greater degree than the prices of securities of other issuers in addition recent federal legislation governing the united states telecommunications industry remains subject to judicial review and additional interpretation which may adversely affect the companies whose securities are held by a trust taxable municipal issues certain bonds in a trust may consist of taxable obligations of municipal issuers obligations of municipal issuers can be either general obligations of a government entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity or revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuers power to levy taxes general obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the issuer the issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith credit and unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority they are not supported by the issuers general power to levy taxes the risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the related project falters because that income is the only source of payment all of the following bonds are revenue bonds airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger offerings this reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities the types of financing projects that these obligations support vary certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease obligation lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these bonds these payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations for the lease payments a governmental body cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments but governments typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets if a government fails to budget for or make lease payments sufficient funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from hospitals and hospital systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels demand for services competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations the need to reduce costs government regulation costs of malpractice insurance and claims and government financial assistance such as medicare and medicaid higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges these issuers derive revenues from tuition dormitories grants and endowments these issuers face problems related to declines in the number of collegeage individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees uncertainty of continued federal grants state funding or donations and government legislation or regulation industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring building or improving industrial projects private corporations usually operate these projects the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project revenues generated by the project expenses of the project and environmental or other regulatory restrictions multifamily housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on multiple family residences retirement housing or housing projects for low to moderateincome families these bonds are generally prepayable at any time it is likely that their life will be less than their stated maturity the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on such factors as rental income occupancy levels operating expenses mortgage default rates taxes government regulations and appropriation of subsidies other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from mental health facilities nursing homes and intermediate care facilities these bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general risks public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring leasing building or improving public buildings such as offices recreation facilities convention centers police stations correctional institutions and parking garages the ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments on the facility user fees or rents costs of maintenance and decreases in use of the facility public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and secondary schools the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends primarily on ad valorem taxes these issuers may also face problems related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education financing retail electricgastelephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for these utilities competition government regulation and rate approvals overhead expenses and the cost of fuels single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on single family residences single family residences generally include one to fourfamily dwellings these bonds are similar to multifamily housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a municipality such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds these bonds are similar to general obligation bonds unlike general obligation bonds however the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay these bonds instead the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to pay these bonds if the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal a municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds an inability to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public transit systems ports highways turnpikes bridges and other transportation systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on variations in use the degree of government subsidization competition from other forms of transportation and increased costs port authorities derive revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities these fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air rail and truck transportation increased fuel costs alternative transportation modes and competition from tollfree bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers that operate bridges roads or tunnels waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from resource recovery facilities these facilities process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity these issuers face problems such as costs and delays due to environmental concerns effects of conservation and recycling destruction or condemnation of a project void or unenforceable contracts changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect operation of a project water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services these issuers face problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases population declines difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and nogrowth zoning ordinances these issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal issuers wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from selling electricity to other utilities the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for electric utilities competition overhead expenses and government regulation and rate approvals zero coupon bonds certain of the bonds in a trust may be zero coupon bonds zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not receive any periodic interest payments the effect of owning deep discount bonds which do not make current interest payments such as the zero coupon bonds is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also in effect on all discount earned during the life of such income on the bond at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount bond but at the same time eliminates the holders ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future for this reason zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which pay interest insurance on the bonds in an insured trust insurance has been obtained by each insured trust by the issuer of bonds in each insured trust by a prior owner of such bonds or by the sponsor prior the deposit of such bonds guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and principal when due in respect of the bonds in such insured trust see the trustsobjective and bond selection in the prospectus each insurance policy obtained by an insured trust is noncancelable and will continue in force so long as such insured trust is in existence the respective portfolio insurer is still in business and the bonds described in such policy continue to be held by such insured trust see portfolio for the trust in the prospectus part i nonpayment of premiums on a policy obtained by an insured trust will not result in the cancellation of insurance but will force the insurer to take action against the trustee to recover premium payments due it the trustee in turn will be entitled to recover such payments from such insured trust premium rates for each issue of bonds protected by the policy obtained by an insured trust are fixed for the life of an insured trust the premium for any insurance policy or policies obtained by an issuer of bonds has been paid by such issuer and any such policy or policies are noncancelable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the portfolio insurer remains in business if the provider of an original issuance insurance policy is unable to meet its obligations under such policy or if the rating assigned to the claimspaying ability of any such insurer deteriorates the portfolio insurers have no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected by either of the above described events the aforementioned trust insurance guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on the bonds as they fall due for the purposes of the portfolio insurance when due generally means the stated maturity date for the payment of principal and interest however in the event a an issuer of a bond defaults in the payment of principal or interest on such bond b such issuer enters into a bankruptcy proceeding or c the maturity of such bond is accelerated the portfolio insurer involved has the option in its sole discretion for a limited period of time after receiving notice of the earliest to occur of such a default bankruptcy proceeding or acceleration to pay the outstanding principal amount of such bond plus accrued interest to the date of such payment and thereby retire the bond from an insured trust prior to such bonds stated maturity date the insurance does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the units insurance obtained by an insured trust is only effective as to bonds owned by and held in such insured trust in the event of a sale of any such bond by the trustee such insurance terminates as to such bond on the date of sale pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of the portfolio insurers the trustee upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy obtained by an insured trust has the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to such bond ie insurance to maturity of the bonds regardless of the identity of the holder thereof the permanent insurance upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium and any expenses related thereto from the proceeds of the sale of such bond accordingly any bond in an insured trust is eligible to be sold on an insured basis it is expected that the trustee would exercise the right to obtain permanent insurance only if upon such exercise an insured trust would receive net proceeds sale of bond proceeds less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the permanent insurance from such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such bonds were sold on an uninsured basisthe insurance premium with respect to each bond eligible for permanent insurance would be determined based upon the insurability of each bond as of the date of deposit and would not be increased or decreased for any change in the creditworthiness of each bond the sponsor believes that the permanent insurance option provides an advantage to an insured trust in that each bond insured by an insured trust insurance policy may be sold out of the insured trust with the benefits of the insurance attaching thereto thus the value of the insurance if any at the time of sale can be realized in the market value of the bond so sold which is not the case in connection with any value attributable to such insured trusts portfolio insurance see public offeringoffering price in the prospectus part ii because any such insurance value may be realized in the market value of the bond upon the sale thereof upon exercise of the permanent insurance option the sponsor anticipates that a in the event an insured trust were to be comprised of a substantial percentage of bonds in default or significant risk of default it is much less likely that the insured trust would need at some point in time to seek a suspension of redemptions of units than if the insured trust were to have no such option see rights of unitholdersredemption of units in the prospectus part ii and b at the time of termination of an insured trust if the insured trust were holding defaulted bonds or bonds in significant risk of default the insured trust would not need to hold such bonds until their respective maturities in order to realize the benefits of the insured trusts portfolio insurance see trust administrationtermination of trust agreement in the prospectus part ii except as indicated below insurance obtained by an insured trust has no effect on the price or redemption value of units it is the present intention of the evaluator to attribute a value for such insurance including the right to obtain permanent insurance for the purpose of computing the price or redemption value of units if the bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default the value of the insurance will be equal to the difference between i the market value of a bond which is in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default assuming the exercise of the right to obtain permanent insurance less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the purchase of permanent insurance and ii the market value of such bond not covered by permanent insurance see public offeringoffering price in the prospectus part ii for a more complete description of an insured trusts method of valuing defaulted bonds which have a significant risk of default ambac assurance corporation ambac assurance effective july   ambac indemnity corporation changed its name to ambac assurance corporation the insurance policy of ambac assurance obtained by an insured trust is noncancelable and will continue in force for so long as the bonds described in the insurance policy are held by an insured trust a monthly premium is paid by an insured trust for the insurance policy obtained by it the trustee will pay when due successively the full amount of each installment of the insurance premium pursuant to a binding agreement with ambac assurance in the event of a sale of a bond covered by the ambac assurance insurance policy the trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance for such bond upon payment of a single predetermined premium from the proceeds of the sale of such bond under the terms of the insurance policy ambac assurance agrees to pay to the trustee that portion of the principal of and interest on the bonds insured by ambac assurance which shall become due for payment but shall be unpaid by reason of nonpayment by the issuer of the bonds the term due for payment means when referring to the principal of a bond so insured its stated maturity date or the date on which it shall have been called for mandatory sinking fund redemption and does not refer to any earlier date on which payment is due by reason of call for redemption other than by mandatory sinking fund redemption acceleration or other advancement of maturity and means when referring to interest on a bond the stated date for payment of interest ambac assurance will make payment to the trustee not later than thirty days after notice from the trustee is received by ambac assurance that a nonpayment of principal or of interest on a bond has occurred but not earlier that the date on which the bonds are due for payment ambac assurance will disburse to the trustee the face amount of principal and interest which is then due for payment but is unpaid by reason of nonpayment by the issuer in exchange for delivery of bonds not less in face amount than the amount of the payment in bearer form free and clear of all liens and encumbrances and uncancelled in cases where bonds are issuable only in a form whereby principal is payable to registered holders or their assigns ambac assurance shall pay principal only upon presentation and surrender of the unpaid bonds uncancelled and free of any adverse claim together with an instrument of assignment in satisfactory form so as to

financial information credit ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information or based on other circumstances the longterm debt obligation credit ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations i likelihood of paymentcapacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the obligation ii nature of and provisions of the obligation iii protection afforded by and relative position of the obligation in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangement under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights the credit rating definitions are expressed in terms of default risk as such they pertain to senior obligations of an entity junior obligations are typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in bankruptcy as noted above such differentiation applies when an entity has both senior and subordinate obligations secured and unsecured obligations or operating company and holding company obligations accordingly in the case of junior debt the rating may not conform exactly

attached to the ratings of instruments with significant noncredit risks it highlights risks to principal or volatility of expected returns which are not addressed in the credit rating nrthis indicates

value of the securities  on the basis of current bid prices of the securities obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in securities comparable to those held by the trust  on the basis of bid prices for comparable securities  by determining the value of the securities by appraisal or  by any combination of the above security cost  the original cost to the trust investment grade trust was based on the determination by jj kenny co of the offering prices of the securities on the date of deposit december   since the valuation is based upon the bid prices the trust investment grade trust recognized a downward adjustment of  on the date of deposit resulting from the difference between the bid and offering prices this downward adjustment was included in the aggregate amount of unrealized depreciation reported in the financial statements for the trust for the period ended october   unit valuation  the redemption price per unit is the pro rata share of each unit in the trust based upon  the cash on hand in the trust or monies in the process of being collected  the securities in the trust based on the value determined by the evaluator and  interest accrued thereon less accrued expenses of the trust if any federal income taxes  the trust is not a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes each unitholder is considered to be the owner of a pro rata portion of the trust and accordingly no provision has been made for federal income taxes other  the financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting any realized gains or losses from securities transactions are reported on an identified cost basis note   portfolio ratings  the source of all ratings exclusive of those designated nr or  is standard  poors a division of the mcgrawhill companies standard  poors ratings marked  are by moodys investors service inc moodys as these securities are not rated by standard  poors nr indicates that the security is not rated by standard  poors or moodys the ratings shown represent the latest published ratings of the securities for a brief description of rating symbols and their related meanings see description of securities ratings in the information supplement redemption feature  there is shown under this heading the year in which each issue of the securities is initially or currently callable and the call price for that year each issue of securities continues to be callable at declining prices thereafter but not below par value except for original issue discount securities which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus if applicable some premium the amount of which will decline in subsequent years in addition even if no year is shown in the table the security may have a make whole call option and be redeemable in whole or in part at any time at the option of the issuer at a redemption price that is generally equal to the sum of the principal amount of the securities a make whole amount and any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption the make whole amount will generally be equal to the excess if any of i the aggregate present value as of the date of redemption of principal being redeemed and the amount of interest exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption that would have been payable if redemption had not been made determined by discounting the remaining principal and interest at a specified rate which varies from security to security and is generally equal to an average of yields on us treasury obligations with maturities corresponding to the remaining life of the security plus a premium rate from the dates on which the principal amount of the securities being redeemed in addition the securities may also be subject to redemption without premium at any time pursuant to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur sf indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of securities pr indicates a security has been prerefunded redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may occur at times when the redeemed securities have an offering side evaluation which represents a premium over par to the extent that the securities were deposited in the trust at a price higher than the price at which they are redeemed this will represent a loss of capital when compared with the original public offering price of the units conversely to the extent that the securities were acquired at a price lower than the redemption price this will represent an increase in capital when compared with the original public offering price of the units distributions will generally be reduced by the amount of the income which would otherwise have been paid with respect to redeemed securities and there will be distributed to unitholders the principal amount in excess of  per unit semiannually and any premium received on such redemption however should the amount available for distribution in the principal account exceed  per unit the trustee will make a special distribution from the principal account on the next succeeding monthly distribution date to holders of record on the related monthly record date the estimated current return in this event may be affected by such redemptions for the federal tax effect on unitholders of such redemptions and resultant distributions see federal tax status in prospectus part ii note   portfolio continued unrealized appreciation and depreciation  an analysis of net unrealized appreciation depreciation at october   is as follows unrealized appreciation   unrealized depreciation      note   other marketability  although it is not obligated to do so the sponsor intends to maintain a market for units and to continuously offer to purchase units at prices subject to change at any time based upon the aggregate bid price of the securities in the portfolio of the trust plus interest accrued to the date of settlement if the supply of units exceeds demand or for other business reasons the sponsor may discontinue purchases of units at such prices in the event that a market is not maintained for the units a unitholder desiring to dispose of his units may be able to do so only by tendering such units to the trustee for redemption at the redemption price cost to investors  the cost to original investors was based on the evaluators determination of the aggregate offering price of the bonds per unit on the date of an investors purchase plus a sales charge of  of the public offering price which is equivalent to  of the aggregate offering price of the bonds for an insured income trust or a longterm investment grade trust and a sales charge of  of the public offering price which is equivalent to  of the aggregate offering price of the bonds for an investment grade trust the secondary market cost to investors is based on the evaluators determination of the aggregate bid price of the bonds per unit on the date of an investors purchase plus a sales charge based upon the estimated longterm return life of the bonds in the trust the sales charge ranges from  of the public offering price  of the aggregate bid price of the bonds for a trust with an estimated longterm return life with less than two years to  of the public offering price  of the aggregate bid price of the bonds for a trust with a portfolio with an estimated longterm return life of twentyone or more years compensation of evaluator and supervisor  the

taxable income series van kampen merritt insured income trust van kampen american capital insured income trust van kampen insured income trust or van kampen focus portfolios insured income trust your trust was created under the laws of the state of new york pursuant to a trust indenture and agreement the trust agreement dated the date of deposit among van kampen funds inc as sponsor standard  poors securities evaluations inc as evaluator van kampen asset management as supervisor and the bank of new york as trustee or their predecessors the trust may be an appropriate medium for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of taxable fixed income securities issued after july   with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually diversification of the trusts assets will not eliminate the risk of loss always inherent in the ownership of bonds for a breakdown of the portfolio see portfolio in prospectus part i in addition bonds of the type initially deposited in the portfolio of the trust are often not available in small amounts and may in the case of any privately placed bonds be available only to institutional investors on the date of deposit the sponsor deposited the bonds with the trustee the bonds initially consisted of delivery statements relating to contracts for their purchase and cash cash equivalents andor irrevocable letters of credit issued by a financial institution thereafter the trustee in exchange for the bonds delivered to the sponsor evidence of ownership of the units a trust that holds primarily longterm bonds as described on the cover of prospectus part i is referred to herein as a longterm trust a trust that holds primarily intermediateterm bonds as described on the cover of prospectus part i is referred to

that holds only insured bonds are referred to herein as insured trusts unless otherwise terminated as provided herein the trust agreement will terminate at the end of the calender year prior to the fiftieth anniversary of its execution in the case of a longterm trust or a laddered trust and at the end of the calender year prior to the twentieth anniversary of its execution in the case of an intermediateterm trust each unit initially offered represents a fractional undivided interest in the principal and net income of the trust to the extent that any units are redeemed by the trustee the fractional undivided interest in the trust represented by each unit will increase although the actual interest in the trust will remain unchanged units will remain outstanding until redeemed by unitholders or until the termination of the trust agreement objective and bond selection the objective of a longterm trust is to provide income and conservation of capital by investing in a professionally selected portfolio primarily consisting of longterm bonds the objective of an intermediateterm trust is to provide income and conservation of capital by investing in a professionally selected portfolio primarily consisting of intermediateterm bonds the objective of a laddered trust is to provide income and conservation of capital by investing in a professionally selected portfolio consisting of bonds with laddered maturities of approximately     and  years from the date of deposit there is of course no guarantee that a trust will achieve its objective your trust may be an appropriate investment vehicle for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of fixed income bonds with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually in selecting bonds for each trust the sponsor considered the following factors among others a either the standard  poors rating of the bonds was not less than bbb or the moodys investors service inc moodys rating of the bonds was not less than baa including provisional or conditional ratings respectively or if not rated the bonds had credit characteristics sufficiently similar to the credit characteristics of interestbearing bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by a trust in the opinion of the sponsor b the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity c the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer and d with respect to the insured trusts the availability and cost of insurance after the date of deposit a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the date of deposit neither event requires elimination of a bond from a trust but may be considered in the sponsors determination as to whether or not to direct the trustee to dispose of the bond see trust administrationportfolio administration in particular the ratings of the bonds in an investment grade trust or a longterm investment grade trust could fall below investment grade ie below bbb or baa during the trusts life and the trust could continue to hold the bonds see the trustsrisk factors insurance guaranteeing the timely payment when due of all principal and interest on the bonds in the trust has been obtained from a bond insurance company for information relating to insurance on the bonds see insurance on the bonds in an insured trust neither the public offering price nor any evaluation of units for purposes of repurchases or redemptions reflects any element of value for the insurance obtained by the trust unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default see public offeringoffering price in addition these bonds are often not available in small amounts in order for bonds to be eligible for insurance they must have credit characteristics which would qualify them for at least the standard  poors rating of bbb or at least the moodys investors service inc rating of baa which in brief represent the lowest ratings for securities of investment grade see description of ratings in the information supplement insurance is not a substitute for the basic credit of an issuer but supplements the existing credit and provides additional security if an issue is accepted for insurance a noncancelable policy for the prompt payment of interest and principal on the bonds when due is issued by the insurer a monthly premium is paid by the trust for the insurance obtained by it the trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance from a portfolio insurer in connection with the sale of a bond insured under the insurance policy obtained from the respective portfolio insurer by a trust upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from the proceeds of the sale of such bond accordingly any bond in a trust is eligible to be sold on an insured basis all bonds insured by a portfolio insurer or by a preinsured bond insurer receive a aaa rating by standard  poors standard  poors describes securities it rates aaa as having the highest rating assigned by standard  poors the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong see insurance on the bonds in an insured trust taxable municipal bonds your trust may invest in taxable municipal bonds states municipalities and public authorities issue these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes in selecting bonds the sponsor seeks to diversify your portfolio by bond purpose this section briefly describes different bond types to help you better understand your investment the types of bonds in your portfolio are listed in prospectus part i these bonds are also described in greater detail in the information supplement general obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the issuer the issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith credit and unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority they are not supported by the issuers general power to levy taxes the risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the related project falters because that income is the only source of payment all of the following bonds are revenue bonds airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports the ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease obligation lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these bonds these payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations for the lease payments a governmental body cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments but governments typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets if a government fails to budget for or make lease payments sufficient funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from hospitals and hospital systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels demand for services competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations the need to reduce costs government regulation cost of malpractice insurance and claims and government financial assistance such as medicare and medicaid public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring leasing building or improving public buildings such as offices recreation facilities convention centers police stations correctional institutions and parking garages the ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments on the facility user fees or rents costs of maintenance and decreases in use of the facility tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a municipality such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds these bonds are similar to general obligation bonds unlike general obligation bonds however the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to pay these bonds if the tax cannot support payment or interest and principal a municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds an inability to raise the tax could have an adverse affect on these bonds transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public transit systems ports highways turnpikes bridges and other transportation systems the ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on variations in use the degree of government subsidization competition from other forms of transportation and increased costs port authorities derive revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities these fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air rail and truck transportation increased fuel costs alternative transportation modes and competition from tollfree bridges and roads will impact revenues of issuers that operate bridges roads or tunnels consumer product and retail issuers your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by companies that manufacture or sell various consumer products general risks of these companies include the general state of the economy intense competition and consumer spending trends a decline in the economy which results in a reduction of consumers disposable income can negatively impact spending habits competitiveness in the retail industry will require large capital outlays for the installation of automated checkout equipment to control inventory track the sale of items and gauge the success of sales campaigns retailers who sell their products over the internet have the potential to access more consumers but will require sophisticated technology to remain competitive financial services companies your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by financial services companies any negative impact on this industry will have a greater impact on the value of units than on a portfolio diversified over several industries you should understand the risks of this industry before you invest banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates portfolio concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans and competition from new entrants in their fields of business in addition banks and their holding companies are extensively regulated at both the federal and state level and may be adversely affected by increased regulations banks will face increased competition from nontraditional lending sources as regulatory changes such as the recently enacted grammleachbliley financial services overhaul legislation permit new entrants to offer various financial products technological advances such as the internet allow these nontraditional lending sources to cut overhead and permit the more efficient use of customer data banks are already facing tremendous pressure from mutual funds brokerage firms and other financial service providers in the competition to furnish services that were traditionally offered by banks companies engaged in investment management and brokerdealer activities are subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceeds the volatility of the securities markets in general adverse changes in the direction of the securities markets investor confidence equity transaction volume the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability of these companies additionally competitive pressures including increased competition with new and existing competitors the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage industries companies involved in investment management and brokerdealer activities are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and selfregulatory organizations and changes in laws regulations or rules or in the interpretation of such laws regulations and rules could adversely affect such companies companies involved in the insurance reinsurance and risk management industry underwrite sell or distribute property casualty and business insurance many factors affect insurance reinsurance and risk management company profits including interest rate movements the imposition of premium rate caps a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings competition and pressure to compete globally weather catastrophes or other disasters and the effects of client mergers already extensively regulated insurance companies profits may be adversely affected by increased government regulations or tax law changes telecommunications companies your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by telecommunications companies these companies are subject to substantial governmental regulation for example the united states government and state governments regulate permitted rates of return and the kinds of services that a company may offer this industry has experienced substantial deregulation in recent years deregulation may lead to fierce competition for market share and can have a negative impact on certain companies recent federal legislation governing the united states telecommunications industry remains subject to judicial review and additional interpretation which may adversely affect the companies whose securities are held by your trust competitive pressures are intense and telecommunications stocks can experience rapid volatility certain telecommunications products may become outdated very rapidly a companys performance can be hurt if the company fails to keep pace with technological advances several recent highprofile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of telecommunications companies high debt loads that were accumulated during the industry growth spurt of the s are catching up to the industry causing debt and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment at the same time demand for some telecommunications services has fallen sharply as several key markets have become oversaturated some local customers have switched to substitute providers and technologies and corporate profits and the economy generally remain weak to meet increasing competition companies may have to commit substantial capital particularly in the formulation of new products and services using new technologies as a result many companies have been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce outsourcing consolidating andor closing existing facilities and divesting low selling product lines furthermore certain companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial results and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny due to these and other factors the risk level of owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased substantially and may continue to rise certain smaller companies in the portfolio may involve greater risk than larger established issuers smaller companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources their securities may trade in lower volumes than larger companies as a result the prices of these securities may fluctuate more than the prices of other issuers utility and energy issuers your trust may invest significantly in bonds issued by utility and energy companies or in companies related to the utility or energy industries many utility and energy companies especially electric and gas and other energy related utility companies are subject to various uncertainties including o risks of increases in fuel and other operating costs o restrictions on operations and increased costs and delays as a result of environmental nuclear safety and other regulations o regulatory restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale costs along to the retail and business customer o coping with the general effects of energy conservation o technological innovations which may render existing plants equipment or products obsolete o the effects of local weather maturing markets and difficulty in expanding to new markets due to regulatory and other factors o the potential impact of natural or manmade disasters o difficulty obtaining adequate returns on invested capital even if frequent rate increases are approved by public service commissions o the high cost of obtaining financing during periods of inflation o difficulties of the capital markets in absorbing utility debt and equity securities and o increased competition any of these factors or a combination of these factors could affect the supply of or demand for electricity natural gas water or other energy which could adversely affect the profitability of the issuers of the securities and the performance of the your trust utility and energy companies are subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels in the united states at the federal level the federal energy regulatory commission the ferc the federal trade commission the ftc the securities and exchange commission the sec and the nuclear regulatory commission the nrc have authority to oversee electric and combination electric and gas utilities the value of utility and energy company stocks may decline because governmental regulation controlling these industries can change this regulation may prevent or delay the company from passing along cost increases to its customers which could hinder the companys ability to meet its obligations to its suppliers and could lead to the taking of measures including the acceleration of obligations or the institution of involuntary bankruptcy proceedings by its creditors against such company recently two california public utilities were threatened with such action by their wholesale suppliers and one of these utilities has filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter  of the us bankruptcy code of  furthermore regulatory authorities which may be subject to political and other pressures may not grant future rate increases or may impose accounting or operational policies any of which could adversely affect a companys profitability and its stock price mergers in the these industries may require approval from several federal and state regulatory agencies including ferc the ftc and the sec these regulatory authorities could as a matter of policy reverse the trend toward deregulation and make consolidation more difficult or cause delay in the merger process any of which could cause the prices of these stocks to fall more about the bonds in addition to describing the purpose of the bonds other information about the bonds is also listed in the portfolio in prospectus part i this information relates to other characteristics of the bonds this section briefly describes some of these characteristics original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their face or par value these bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value in a stable interest rate environment the market value of these bonds tends to increase more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach maturity the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond these bonds do not pay any current interest during their life if an investor own this type of bond the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bonds par value at maturity the price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current interest payments the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value when as and if issued bonds are bonds that trade before they are actually issued this means that the sponsor can only deliver them to your trust when as and if the bonds are actually issued delivery of these bonds may be delayed or may not occur interest on these bonds does not begin accruing to your trust until the sponsor delivers the bond to the trust you may have to adjust your tax basis if the sponsor delivers any of these bonds after the expected delivery date any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued between the time you purchased your units and the delivery of the bonds to your trust this could lower your first year estimated current return you may experience gains or losses on these bonds from the time you purchase units even though your trust has not yet received them risk factors all investments involve risk this section describes the main risks that can impact the value of bonds in your trust you should understand these risks before you invest if the value of the bonds falls the value of your units will also fall you can lose money by investing in a trust no one can guarantee that your trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period the information supplement contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your trust will fluctuate this could cause the value of your units to fall below your original purchase price or below the par value market value fluctuates in response to various factors these can include changes in interest rates inflation the financial condition of a bonds issuer or insurer perceptions of the issuer or insurer or ratings on a bond even though the supervisor supervises your portfolio you should remember that no one manages your portfolio your trust will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest rates increase bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall bonds with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes credit risk is the risk that a bonds issuer or insurer is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or calls a bond before its stated maturity an issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original purpose if an issuer calls a bond your trust will distribute the principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall you might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield a bonds call price could be less than the price your trust paid for the bond and could be below the bonds par value this means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your units if enough bonds in your trust are called your trust could terminate early the first date that the issuer can call each bond is listed in the portfolio in prospectus part i along with the price the issuer would have to pay bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating agency decreases the bonds rating bond concentration risk is the risk that your trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of bond when a certain type of bond makes up  or more of a trust the trust is considered to be concentrated in that bond type the different bond types are described under the bonds reduced diversification risk is the risk that your trust will become smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold are called or mature this could increase your risk of loss and increase your share of trust expenses liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in the bond is limited or absent no one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the overthecounter market they are not listed on a securities exchange litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or legislation could affect the value of your trust litigation could challenge an issuers authority to issue or make payments on bonds no fdic guarantee an investment in your trust is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency estimated current and longterm returns the estimated current returns and the estimated longterm returns are set forth in the prospectus part i estimated current return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price the estimated net annual interest income per unit will vary with changes in fees and expenses of the trust and with the principal prepayment redemption maturity exchange or sale of bonds the public offering price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds accordingly there is no assurance that the present estimated current return will be realized in the future estimated longterm return is calculated using a formula which  takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values yields which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements of the bonds and  takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with units since the value and estimated retirements of the bonds and the expenses of a trust will change there is no assurance that the present estimated longterm return will be realized in the future the estimated current return and estimated longterm return are expected to differ because the calculation of estimated longterm return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while the estimated current return calculation includes only net annual interest income and public offering price in order to acquire certain bonds it may be necessary for the sponsor or trustee to pay amounts covering accrued interest on the bonds which exceed the amounts which will be made available through cash furnished by the sponsor on the date of deposit this cash may exceed the interest which would accrue to the first settlement date the trustee has agreed to pay for any amounts necessary to cover any excess and will be reimbursed when funds become available from interest payments on the related bonds public offering general units are offered at the public offering price the secondary market public offering price is based on the bid prices of the bonds the sales charge described below cash if any in the principal account plus accrued interest if any the minimum purchase is one unit the minimum purchase is the number of units stated in the contract between the sponsor and the related broker or agent certain brokerdealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing unit purchased the secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the following table based upon the estimated longterm return life of the trusts portfolio estimated longterm return life sales charge                                            to   for purposes of computation of the estimated longterm return life bonds will be deemed to mature on their expressed maturity dates unless a the bonds have been called for redemption or are subject to redemption at an earlier call date in which case this call date will be deemed to be the maturity date or b the bonds are subject to a mandatory tender in which case the mandatory tender will be deemed to be the maturity date the sales charges in the above table are expressed as a percentage of the aggregate bid prices of the bonds expressed as a percent of the public offering price the sales charge on the trust consisting entirely of bonds with in estimated longterm return life of  years would

the sponsor of this discount when you purchase units before you purchase units you must also inform your brokerdealer of your qualification for this discount to be eligible for the reduced sales charge reducing your sales charge the sponsor offers a variety of ways for you to reduce the sales charge that you pay it is your financial professionals responsibility to alert the sponsor of any discount when you purchase units before you purchase units you must also inform your brokerdealer of your qualification for any discount or of any combined purchases to be eligible for a reduced sales charge fee accounts a portion of the sales charge is waived for certain accounts described in this paragraph purchases by these accounts are subject only to the portion of the sales charge that is retained by the sponsor please refer to the section called fee accounts for additional information on these purchases units may be purchased in the primary or secondary market at the public offering price less the concession the sponsor typically allows to brokers and dealers for purchases by investors who purchase units through registered investment advisers certified financial planners and registered brokerdealers who in each case either charge periodic fees for brokerage services financial planning investment advisory or asset management services or provide such services in connection with the establishment of an investment account for which a comprehensive wrap fee charge is imposed fee accounts the sponsor reserves the right to limit or deny purchases of units described in this paragraph by investors or selling firms whose frequent trading activity is determined to be detrimental to a trust employees employees officers and directors including their spouses and children under  living in the same household and trustees custodians or fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons of van kampen funds inc and its affiliates and dealers and their affiliates may purchase units at the public offering price less the applicable dealer concession offering price the public offering price of units will vary from the amounts stated under summary of essential financial information in prospectus part i in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds the price of units on the date of deposit was determined by adding the applicable sales charge to the aggregate offering price of the bonds and dividing the sum by the number of units outstanding the evaluator will value the bonds as of the evaluation time on days the new york stock exchange is open for business and will adjust the public offering price of units accordingly this public offering price will be effective for all orders received at or prior to the evaluation time on each such day the evaluation time is the close of regular trading on the new york stock exchange on each day that the exchange is open for trading orders received by the trustee or sponsor for purchases sales or redemptions after that time or on a day when the new york stock exchange is closed will be held until the next determination of price the secondary market public offering price per unit will be equal to the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the applicable secondary market sales charge and dividing the sum by the number of units outstanding for secondary market purposes this computation will be made by the evaluator as of the evaluation time for each day on which any unit is tendered for redemption and as necessary the offering price of bonds may be expected to average approximately  more than the bid price the aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of bid prices or offering prices as is appropriate a on the basis of current market prices obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by the trust b if these prices are not available on the basis of current market prices for comparable bonds c by causing the value of the bonds to be determined by others engaged in the practice of evaluation quoting or appraising comparable bonds or d by any combination of the above market prices of the bonds will generally fluctuate with changes in market interest rates unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of default the evaluator will not attribute any value to the insurance obtained by the trust the evaluator will consider in its evaluation of bonds which are in default in payment of principal or interest or in the sponsors opinion in significant risk of default the defaulted bonds the value of any insurance guaranteeing interest and principal payments the value of the insurance will be equal to the difference between i the market value of defaulted bonds assuming the exercise of the right to obtain permanent insurance less the insurance premiums and related expenses attributable to the purchase of permanent insurance and ii the market value of defaulted bonds not covered by permanent insurance in addition the evaluator will consider the ability of a portfolio insurer to meet its commitments under any insurance policy including commitments to issue permanent insurance no value has been ascribed to insurance obtained by an insured trust if any as of the date of this prospectus a person will become the owner of units on the date of settlement provided payment has been received cash if any made available to the sponsor prior to the date of settlement for the purchase of units may be used in the sponsors business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the sponsor subject to the limitations of the securities exchange act of  accrued interest accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on securities which generally is paid semiannually although the trust accrues interest daily because of this the trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee for this reason with respect to sales settling after the first settlement date the proportionate share of accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the public offering price of units of series other than those described in the following two sections unitholders will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on their units on the next distribution date in an effort to reduce the accrued interest which would have to be paid by unitholders the trustee will advance the amount of accrued interest to the sponsor as the unitholder of record as of the first settlement date consequently the accrued interest added to the public offering price of units will include only accrued interest from the first settlement date to the date of settlement less any distributions from the interest account after the first settlement date because of the varying interest payment dates of the bonds accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest actually received by the trust and distributed to unitholders if a unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his units he will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the accrued interest from the purchaser of his units accrued interest accrued interest to carry added to the public offering price of units for insured income trust series  and prior series is accrued interest to carry accrued interest to carry consists of two elements the first element arises as a result of accrued interest which is the accumulation of unpaid interest on a bond from the last day on which interest thereon was paid interest on bonds in the trust is actually paid either monthly or semiannually to the trust however interest on the bonds in the trust is accounted for daily on an accrual basis because of this the trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee because of coupons that are not yet due for this reason the public offering price of units will have added to it the proportionate share of accrued and undistributed interest to the date of settlement the second element of accrued interest to carry arises because of the structure of the interest account the trustee has no cash for distribution to unitholders until it receives interest payments on the bonds in the trust the trustee is obligated to provide its own funds at times in order to advance interest distributions the trustee will recover these advancements when such interest is received interest account balances are established so that it will not be necessary on a regular basis for the trustee to advance its own funds in connection with such interest distributions the interest account balances are also structured so that there will generally be positive cash balances and since the funds held by the trustee will be used by it to earn interest thereon it benefits thereby if the unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his units or if the bonds in the trust are sold or otherwise removed or if the trust is liquidated he will receive at that time his proportionate share of the accrued interest to carry computed to the settlement date in the case of sale or liquidation and to the date of tender in the case of redemption purchased and accrued interest added to the public offering price of units for insured income trust series  is purchased interest and accrued interest as described below purchased interest purchased interest is a portion of the unpaid interest that has accrued on the bonds from the later of the last payment date on the bonds or the date of issuance thereof through the first settlement date and is included in the calculation of the public offering price purchased interest will be distributed to unitholders as units are redeemed or bonds mature or are called see summary of essential financial information in prospectus part i for the amount of purchased interest per unit for each trust purchased interest is an element of the price unitholders will receive in connection with the sale or redemption of units prior to the termination of the trust accrued interest accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on securities which generally is paid semiannually although a trust accrues such interest daily because of this a trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee for this reason the public offering price of units will have added to it the proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of settlement unitholders will receive on the next distribution date of a trust the amount if any of accrued interest paid on their units as indicated in purchased interest accrued interest as of the first settlement date includes purchased interest in an effort to reduce the amount of purchased interest which would otherwise have to be paid by unitholders the trustee may advance a portion of such accrued interest to the sponsor as the unitholder of record as of the first settlement date consequently the amount of accrued interest to be added to the public offering price of units will include only accrued interest from the first settlement date to the date of settlement other than the purchased interest already included therein less any distributions from the interest account subsequent to the first settlement date see rights of unitholdersdistributions of interest and principal because of the varying interest payment dates of the bonds accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest actually received by a trust and distributed to unitholders if a unitholder sells or redeems all or a portion of his units he will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the purchased interest and accrued interest from the purchaser of his units since the trustee has the use of the funds including purchased interest held in the interest account for distributions to unitholders and since such account is noninterestbearing to unitholders the trustee benefits thereby unit distribution units will be distributed to the public by brokerdealers and others at the public offering price plus accrued interest the sponsor intends to qualify units for sale in a number of states brokerdealers or others will be allowed a concession or agency commission in connection with the distribution of units equal to  of the applicable sales charge certain commercial banks may be making units available to their customers on an agency basis a portion of the sales charge paid by these customers equal to the agency commission referred to above is retained by or remitted to the banks any discount provided to investors will be borne by the selling dealer or agent the sponsor reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any order for the purchase of units and to change the amount of the concession or agency commission to dealers and others from time to time sponsor compensation brokerdealers will receive a gross sales commission equal to the sales charge applicable to the transaction involved see public offeringgeneral the sponsor will receive from the brokerdealers the excess of this gross sales commission over the amounts set forth in the previous section in addition the sponsor may have realized a profit or loss as a result of the difference between the price paid for the bonds by the sponsor and the cost of the bonds to the trust the sponsor or its affiliates may also have realized profits or losses with respect to bonds which were acquired by the sponsor from underwriting syndicates of which they were members the sponsor has not participated as sole underwriter or as manager or as a member of the underwriting syndicates from which the bonds in the trust were acquired the sponsor may further realize profit or loss as a result of possible fluctuations in the market value of the bonds since all proceeds received from purchasers of units excluding dealer concessions or agency commissions allowed if any will be retained by the sponsor the sponsor will also realize profits or losses in the amount of any difference between the price at which units are purchased and the price at which units are resold in connection with maintaining a secondary market for units and will also realize profits or losses resulting from a redemption of repurchased units at a price above or below the purchase price brokerdealers of the trust banks andor others are eligible to participate in a program in which such firms receive from the sponsor a nominal award for each of their representatives who have sold a minimum number of units of unit investment trusts created by the sponsor during a specified time period in addition at various times the sponsor may implement other programs under which the sales forces of such firms may be eligible to win other nominal awards for certain sales efforts or under which the sponsor will reallow to any such firms that sponsor sales contests or recognition programs conforming to criteria established by the sponsor or participate in sales programs sponsored by the sponsor an amount not exceeding the total applicable sales charges on the sales generated by such persons at the public offering price during such programs also the sponsor in its discretion may from time to time pursuant to objective criteria established by the sponsor pay fees to qualifying firms for certain services or activities which are primarily intended to result in sales of units of the trust such payments are made by the sponsor out of its own assets and not out of the assets of the trust these programs will not change the price unitholders pay for their units or the amount that the trust will receive from the units sold approximately every eighteen months the sponsor holds a business seminar which is open to underwriters that sell units of trusts it sponsors the sponsor pays substantially all costs associated with the seminar excluding underwriter travel costs each underwriter is invited to send a certain number of representatives based on the gross number of units such firm underwrites during a designated time period market for units although not obligated to do so the sponsor intends to maintain a market for units and offer to purchase units at prices subject to change at any time based upon the aggregate bid prices of the bonds plus accrued interest and any principal cash on hand less any amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges payable out of the trust and less any accrued trust expenses if the supply of units exceeds demand or if some other business reason warrants it the sponsor may either discontinue all purchases of units or discontinue purchases of units at these prices if a market is not maintained and the unitholder cannot find another purchaser a unitholder will be able to dispose of units by tendering them to the trustee for redemption at the redemption price see rights of unitholdersredemption of units a unitholder who wishes to dispose of his units should inquire of his broker as to current market prices in order to determine whether there is in any price in excess of the redemption price and if so the amount thereof the trustee will notify the sponsor of any tender of units for redemption if the sponsors bid in the secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the redemption price per unit it may purchase the units not later than the day on which the units would otherwise have been redeemed by the trustee rights of unitholders distributions of interest and principal interest received by the trust pro rated on an annual basis will be distributed monthly unless a unitholder elects to receive quarterly or semiannual distributions certain trusts do not offer all distribution options please refer to prospectus part i the plan of distribution selected by a unitholder will remain in effect until changed unitholders who purchase units in the secondary market will receive distributions in accordance with the election of the prior owner unitholders may change their distribution plan by indicating the change on a card which may be obtained from the trustee and return the card to the trustee with their certificates and other documentation required by the trustee certificates should be sent by registered or certified mail to avoid their being lost or stolen if the card and certificate are properly presented to the trustee the change will become effective on the first day after the next semiannual record date and will remain effective until changed interest received by the trust including that part of the proceeds of any disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest is credited by the trustee to the interest account other receipts are credited to the principal account after deduction of amounts sufficient to reimburse the trustee without interest for any amounts advanced and paid to the sponsor as the unitholder of record as of the first settlement date interest received will be distributed on each distribution date to unitholders of record as of the preceding record date all distributions will be net of estimated expenses funds in the principal account will be distributed on each semiannual distribution date to unitholders of record as of the preceding semiannual record date the trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the principal or interest account but may itself earn interest thereon and therefore benefits from the use of these funds nor to make a distribution from the principal account unless the amount available for distribution therein shall equal at least  per unit however should the amount available for distribution in the principal account equal or exceed  per unit the trustee will make a special distribution from the principal account on the next monthly distribution date to unitholders of record on the related monthly record date because interest payments are not received by the trust at a constant rate throughout the year interest distributions may be more or less than the amount credited to the interest account as of the record date for the purpose of minimizing fluctuations in interest distributions the trustee is authorized to advance amounts necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately equal amounts the trustee is reimbursed for these advances from funds in the interest account on the next record date persons who purchase units between a record date and a distribution date will receive their first distribution on the second distribution date after the purchase under the applicable plan of distribution reinvestment option unitholders may elect to have distributions on their units automatically reinvested in shares of certain van kampen mutual funds which are registered in the unitholders state of residence the reinvestment funds each reinvestment fund has investment objectives that differ from those of the trust the prospectus relating to each reinvestment fund describes its investment policies and the procedures to follow to begin reinvestment a unitholder may obtain a prospectus for the reinvestment funds from van kampen funds inc at  parkview plaza po box  oakbrook terrace illinois  after becoming a participant in a reinvestment plan each trust distribution will automatically be applied on the applicable distribution date to purchase shares of the applicable reinvestment fund at a net asset value computed on such date unitholders with an existing planned reinvestment option pro program account whereby a sales charge is imposed on distribution reinvestments may transfer their existing account into a new pro account which allows purchases of reinvestment fund shares at net asset value confirmations of all reinvestments will be mailed to the unitholder by the reinvestment

tender to the trustee at its unit investment trust division  barclay street th floor new york new york  of the certificates representing the units to be redeemed duly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer with signature guaranteed or by providing satisfactory indemnity such as in connection with lost stolen or destroyed certificates and by payment of applicable governmental charges if any redemption of units cannot occur until certificates representing the units or satisfactory indemnity have been received by the trustee no later than seven calendar days following satisfactory tender the unitholder will receive an amount for each unit equal to the redemption price per unit next computed after receipt by the trustee of the tender of units the date of tender is deemed to be the date on which units are received by the trustee except that as regards units received after the evaluation time on days of trading on the new york stock exchange the date of tender is the next day on which that exchange is open and the units will be deemed to have been tendered to the trustee on that day for redemption at the redemption price certain brokerdealers or selling firms may charge an order handling fee for processing redemption requests units redeemed directly through the trustee are not subject to such fees under internal revenue service regulations the trustee is required to withhold a specified percentage of a unit redemption if the trustee has not received the unitholders tax identification number as required by such regulations any amount withheld is transmitted to the internal revenue service and may be recovered by the unitholder only when filing a return under normal circumstances the trustee obtains the unitholders tax identification number from the selling broker however at any time a unitholder elects to tender units for redemption the unitholder should provide a tax identification number to the trustee in order to avoid this possible backup withholding the redemption price per unit as well as the secondary market public offering price will be determined on the basis of the bid price of the bonds as of the evaluation time on days of trading on the new york stock exchange on the date any such determination is made the evaluator determines the redemption price per unit on days units are tendered for redemption the redemption price per unit is the pro rata share of each unit on the basis of i the cash on hand in the trust or moneys in the process of being collected ii the value of the bonds based on the bid prices of the bonds except for cases in which the value of insurance has been included iii accrued interest less a amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges and b the accrued trust expenses the evaluator may determine the value of the bonds by employing any of the methods set forth in public offeringoffering price in determining the redemption price per unit no value will be assigned to the portfolio insurance maintained on the bonds in the trust unless the bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of default for a description of the situations in which the evaluator may value the insurance obtained by the trust see public offeringoffering price accrued interest paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the interest account or if the balance therein is insufficient from the principal account all other amounts will be withdrawn from the principal account units so redeemed shall be cancelled the price at which units may be redeemed could be

trust this section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state or foreign taxes as with any investment you should consult your own tax professional about your particular consequences in addition the internal revenue service issued new withholding and reporting regulations effective january   foreign investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of these regulations assets of a trust each trust will hold various debt obligations the debt obligations all of the assets held by a trust constitute the trust assets for purposes of this federal tax discussion it is assumed that the debt obligations constitute debt the interest on which is includible in gross income for federal income tax purposes trust status a trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax purposes as a unit owner you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of the assets of your trust and as such you will be considered to have received a pro rata share of income eg interest accruals of original issue discount and capital gains if any from the trust assets when such income would be considered to be received by you if you directly owned the trust assets this is true even if you elect to have your distributions automatically reinvested into additional units in addition the income from the trust assets which you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay trust expenses including the deferred sales charge if any your tax basis and income or loss upon disposition if your trust disposes of trust assets you will generally recognize gain or loss if you dispose of your units or redeem your units for cash you will also generally recognize gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in the related trust assets from your share of the total amount received in the transaction you can generally determine your initial tax basis in each trust asset by apportioning the cost of your units generally including sales charges among each trust asset ratably according to their value on the date you purchase your units in certain circumstances however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units for example in the case of accruals of original issue discount market discount premium and accrued interest as discussed below under the recently enacted jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of  the tax act if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  generally  for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets these new capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years ending on or after may   and beginning before january   however special effective date provisions are set forth in the tax act for example there are special transaction rules provided with respect to gain properly taken into account for the portion of the taxable year before may   for periods not covered by these reduced rates under the tax act if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally   for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets the  rate is reduced to  and the  rate is reduced to  for longterm gains from most property acquired after december   with a holding period of more than five years net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine the holding period of your units the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code however treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations discount accrued interest and premium on debt obligations some debt obligations may have been sold with original issue discount this generally means that the debt obligations were originally issued at a price below their face or par value original issue discount accrues on a daily basis and generally is treated as interest income for federal income tax purposes your basis of each debt obligation which was issued with original issue discount must be increased as original issue discount accrues some debt obligations may have been purchased by you or your trust at a market discount market discount is generally the excess of the stated redemption price at maturity for the debt obligation over the purchase price of the debt obligation market discount can arise based on the price a trust pays for a debt obligation or on the price you pay for your units market discount is taxed as ordinary income you will recognize this income when your trust receives principal payments on the debt obligation when the debt obligation is disposed of or redeemed or when you sell or redeem your units alternatively you may elect to include market discount in taxable income as it accrues whether or not you make this election will affect how you calculate your basis and the timing of certain interest expense deductions stripped us treasury obligations are subject to the original issue discount rules rather than being treated as having market discount alternatively some debt obligations may have been purchased by you or your trust at a premium generally if the tax basis of your pro rata portion of any debt obligation generally including sales charges exceeds the amount payable at maturity such excess is considered premium you may elect to amortize premium if you make this election you may reduce your interest income received on the debt obligation by the amount of the premium that is amortized and your tax basis will be reduced if the price of your units includes accrued interest on a debt obligation you must include the accrued interest in your tax basis in that debt obligation when your trust receives this accrued interest you must treat it as a return of capital and reduce your tax basis in the debt obligation this discussion provides only the general rules with respect to the tax treatment of original issue discount market discount and premium the rules however are complex and special rules apply in certain circumstances for example the accrual of market discount or premium may differ from the discussion set forth above in the case of debt obligations that were issued with original issue discount if you elect to reinvest amounts received from the trust into a future trust it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain and any loss will be treated as a capital loss however any loss you incur in connection with the exchange of your units of your trust for units of a future trust will generally be disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and subsequent deemed repurchase to the extent the two trusts have substantially identical assets under the wash sale provisions of the internal revenue code limitations on the deductibility of trust expenses generally for federal income tax purposes you must take into account your full pro rata share of your trusts income even if some of that income is used to pay trust expenses you may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by the trust to the same extent as if you directly paid the expense you may however be required to treat some or all of the expenses of your trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions to the extent they exceed  of adjusted gross income foreign state and local taxes some distributions by your trust may be subject to foreign withholding taxes any interest withheld will nevertheless be treated as income to you however because you are deemed to have paid directly your share of foreign taxes that have been paid or accrued by your trust you may be entitled to a foreign tax credit or deduction for us tax purposes with respect to such taxes if you are a foreign investor ie an investor other than a us citizen or resident or a us corporation partnership estate or trust you will not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes on some of the income from your trust or on gain from the sale or redemption of your units provided that certain conditions are met you should consult your tax advisor with respect to the conditions you must meet in order to be exempt for us tax purposes in the opinion of special counsel to the trusts for new york tax matters the trusts are not associations taxable as corporations and the income of the trusts will be treated as the income of the unitholders under the existing income tax laws of the state and city of new york expenses general the trustee will periodically deduct from the interest account and to the extent funds are not sufficient therein from the principal account amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the trusts the trustee also may withdraw from these accounts such amounts if any as it deems necessary to establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of the trusts amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a trusts assets until such time as the trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the appropriate accounts all costs and expenses incurred in creating and establishing the trusts including the cost of the initial preparation printing and execution of the trust agreement and the certificates legal and accounting expenses advertising and selling expenses expenses of the trustee initial evaluation fees and other outofpocket

year and as of the close of business on january  for each year thereafter insurance premiums for any portfolio insurance are obligations of each trust and are payable monthly by the trustee on behalf

bonds consumer product and retail issuers certain trusts may invest significantly in bonds of issuers that manufacture or sell consumer products the profitability of these companies will be affected by various factors including the general state of the economy and consumer spending trends in the past there have been major changes in the retail environment due to the declaration of bankruptcy by some of the major corporations involved in the retail industry particularly the department store segment the continued viability of the retail industry will depend on the industrys ability to adapt and to compete in changing economic and social conditions to attract and retain capable management and to finance expansion weakness in the banking or real estate industry a recessionary economic climate with the consequent slowdown in employment growth less favorable trends in unemployment or a marked deceleration in real disposable personal income growth could result in significant pressure on both consumer wealth and consumer confidence adversely affecting consumer spending habits in addition competitiveness of the retail industry will require large capital outlays for investment in the installation of automated checkout equipment to control inventory to track the sale of individual items and to gauge the success of sales campaigns increasing employee and retiree benefit costs may also have an adverse effect on the industry in many sectors of the retail industry competition may be fierce due to market saturation converging consumer tastes and other factors because of these factors and the recent increase in trade opportunities with other countries american retailers are now entering global markets which entail added risks such as sudden weakening of foreign economies difficulty in adapting to local conditions and constraints and added research costs financial services companies an investment in your trust should be made with an understanding of the problems and risks inherent in the bank and financial services sector in general banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse effects of economic recession volatile interest rates portfolio concentrations in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans and competition from new entrants in their fields of business banks are highly dependent on net interest margin recently bank profits have come under pressure as net interest margins have contracted but volume gains have been strong in both commercial and consumer products there is no certainty that such conditions will continue banks had received significant consumer mortgage fee income as a result of activity in mortgage and refinance markets as initial home purchasing and refinancing activity subsided as a result of increasing interest rates and other factors this income diminished economic conditions in the real estate markets which have been weak in the past can have a substantial effect upon banks because they generally have a portion of their assets invested in loans secured by real estate banks and their holding companies are subject to extensive federal regulation and when such institutions are statechartered to state regulation as well such regulations impose strict capital requirements and limitations on the nature and extent of business activities that banks may pursue furthermore bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement authority and may substantially restrict the permissible activities of a particular institution if deemed to pose significant risks to the soundness of such institution or the safety of the federal deposit insurance fund regulatory actions such as increases in the minimum capital requirements applicable to banks and increases in deposit insurance premiums required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic can negatively impact earnings and the ability of a company to pay dividends neither federal insurance of deposits nor governmental regulations however insures the solvency or profitability of banks or their holding companies or insures against any risk of investment in the securities issued by such institutions the statutory requirements applicable to and regulatory supervision of banks and their holding companies have increased significantly and have undergone substantial change in recent years to a great extent these changes are embodied in the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act enacted in august  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  and the regulations promulgated under these laws many of the regulations promulgated pursuant to these laws have only recently been finalized and their impact on the business financial condition and prospects of the securities in the trusts portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty the recently enacted grammleachbliley financialservices overhaul legislation will allow banks securities firms and insurance companies to form onestop financial conglomerates marketing a wide range of financial service products to investors this legislation will likely result in increased merger activity and heightened competition among existing and new participants in the field legislation to liberalize interstate banking has recently been signed into law under the legislation banks will be able to purchase or establish subsidiary banks in any state one year after the legislations enactment since mid banks have been allowed to turn existing banks into branches consolidation is likely to continue the securities and exchange commission and the financial accounting standards board require the expanded use of market value accounting by banks and have imposed rules requiring market accounting for investment securities held in trading accounts or available for sale adoption of additional such rules may result in increased volatility in the reported health of the industry and mandated regulatory intervention to correct such problems additional legislative and regulatory changes may be forthcoming for example the bank regulatory authorities have proposed substantial changes to the community reinvestment act and fair lending laws rules and regulations and there can be no certainty as to the effect if any that such changes would have on the bonds in the trusts portfolio in addition from time to time the deposit insurance system is reviewed by congress and federal regulators and proposed reforms of that system could among other things further restrict the ways in which deposited moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount or number of deposits insured for any depositor such reforms could reduce profitability as investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited and as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits banks face significant competition from other financial institutions such as mutual funds credit unions mortgage banking companies and insurance companies and increased competition may result from legislative broadening of regional and national interstate banking powers among other benefits such legislation allows banks and bank holding companies to acquire across previously prohibited state lines and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into one unit neither the sponsor nor any underwriter makes any prediction as to what if any manner of bank regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or what ultimate effect such actions might have on the trusts portfolio the federal bank holding company act of  generally prohibits a bank holding company from  acquiring directly or indirectly more than  of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company  acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company  acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank or  merging or consolidating with another bank holding company without first obtaining federal reserve board frb approval in considering an application with respect to any such transaction the frb is required to consider a variety of factors including the potential anticompetitive effects of the transaction the financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting institutions the managerial resources of the resulting institution the convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve the record of performance of each combining organization under the community reinvestment act and the equal credit opportunity act and the prospective availability to the frb of information appropriate to determine ongoing regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws in addition the federal change in bank control act and various state laws impose limitations on the ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks or bank holding companies the frb has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies in the policy statement the frb expressed its view that a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that would weaken its financial health such as by borrowing the frb also may impose limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of certain applications including applications for approval of mergers and acquisitions neither the sponsor nor any underwriter makes any prediction as to the effect if any such laws will have on the bonds or whether such approvals if necessary will be obtained

adverse changes in the direction of the stock market investor confidence equity transaction volume the level and direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial stability as well as the stock prices of these companies additionally competitive pressures including increased competition with new and existing competitors the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage industries companies involved in the investment management industry are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and selfregulatory organizations and changes in laws regulations or rules or in the interpretation of such laws regulations and rules could adversely affect such companies companies involved in the insurance reinsurance and risk management industry underwrite sell or distribute property casualty and business insurance many factors affect insurance reinsurance and risk management company profits including but not limited to interest rate movements the imposition of premium rate caps a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings competition and pressure to compete globally weather catastrophes or other disasters and the effects of client mergers individual companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve inadequacy and the inability to collect from reinsurance carriers insurance companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation including the imposition of maximum rate levels which may not be adequate for some lines of business proposed or potential tax law changes may also adversely affect insurance companies policy sales tax obligations and profitability in addition to the foregoing profit margins of these companies continue to shrink due to the commoditization of traditional businesses new competitors capital expenditures on new technology and the pressure to compete globally in addition to the normal risks of business companies involved in the insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors including those applicable to regulated insurance companies such as o the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves and the fact that ultimate losses could materially exceed established loss reserves which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition o the fact that insurance companies have experienced and can be expected in the future to experience catastrophic losses which could have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions results of operations and cash flow o the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing propertyliability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment patterns caused by new claim settlement practices o the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus particularly in light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state insurance regulatory authorities and in order to maintain acceptable financial strength or claimspaying ability ratings o the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies are subject and various regulatory and other legal actions o the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the value of an insurance companys investment portfolio and on the attractiveness of certain of its products and o the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance and the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables the state insurance regulatory framework has during recent years come under increased federal scrutiny and certain state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that alter and in many cases increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company systems further the national association of insurance commissioners naic and state insurance regulators are reexamining existing laws and regulations specifically focusing on insurance companies interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws in addition congress and certain federal agencies have investigated the condition of the insurance industry in the united states to determine whether to promulgate additional federal regulation the sponsor is unable to predict whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the nature or scope of regulation of the insurance industry or what effect if any such legislation would have on the industry all insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain investment categories failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause nonconforming investments to be treated as nonadmitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and in some instances would require divestiture telecommunications issuers because certain trusts are concentrated in bonds issued by telecommunications companies the value of the units may be susceptible to factors affecting the telecommunications industry the telecommunications industry is subject to governmental regulation and the products and services of telecommunications companies may be subject to rapid obsolescence these factors could affect the value of units telephone companies in the united states for example are subject to both state and federal regulations affecting permitted rates of returns and the kinds of services that may be offered certain types of companies represented in a portfolio are engaged in fierce competition for a share of the market of their products as a result competitive pressures are intense and the stocks are subject to rapid price volatility several recent highprofile bankruptcies of large telecommunications companies have illustrated the potentially unstable condition of telecommunications companies high debt loads that were accumulated during the industry growth spurt of the s are catching up to the industry causing debt and stock prices to trade at distressed levels for many telecommunications companies and increasing the cost of capital for needed additional investment at the same time demand for some telecommunications services has fallen sharply as several key markets have become oversaturated some local customers have switched to substitute providers and technologies and corporate profits and the economy generally remain weak to meet increasing competition companies may have to commit substantial capital particularly in the formulation of new products and services using new technologies as a result many companies have been compelled to cut costs by reducing their workforce outsourcing consolidating andor closing existing facilities and divesting low selling product lines furthermore certain companies involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial results and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny due to these and other factors the risk level of owning the securities of telecommunications companies has increased substantially and may continue to rise while a portfolio may concentrate on the securities of established suppliers of traditional telecommunication products and services a trust may also invest in bonds of smaller telecommunications companies which may benefit from the development of new products and services these smaller companies may present greater opportunities for capital appreciation and may also involve greater risk than large established issuers such smaller companies may have limited product lines market or financial resources and their securities may trade less frequently and in limited volume than the securities of larger more established companies as a result the prices of the securities of such smaller companies may fluctuate to a greater degree than the prices of securities of other issuers in addition recent federal legislation governing the united states telecommunications industry remains subject to judicial review and additional interpretation which may adversely affect the companies whose securities are held by a trust utility and energy issuers an investment in units of certain trusts should be made with an understanding of the characteristics of the public utility and energy industries and the risks which such an investment may entail general problems of the public utility and energy industries include the difficulty in obtaining an adequate return on invested capital despite frequent increases in rates which have been granted by the public service commissions having jurisdiction the difficulty in financing large construction programs during an inflationary period the restrictions on operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental nuclear safety and other regulatory considerations the difficulty of the capital markets absorbing utility debt and equity securities the difficulty in obtaining fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices regulatory restrictions on the ability to pass increasing wholesale costs along to the retail and business customer and the effects of energy conservation there is no assurance that public service commissions will grant rate increases in the future or that any such increases will be timely or adequate to cover operating and other expenses and debt service requirements all of the public utilities which are issuers of the securities have been experiencing many of these problems in varying degrees furthermore utility and energy stocks are particularly susceptible to interest rate risk generally exhibiting an inverse relationship to interest rates as a result electric utility stock prices may be adversely affected as interest rates rise similarly the success of certain companies is tied to a relatively small concentration of products or technologies with intense competition between companies there can be no assurance that these customers will place additional orders or that an issuer of securities will obtain orders of similar magnitude as past orders from other customers accordingly a decline in demand of such products technologies or from such customers could have a material adverse impact on issuers of the securities utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation by state utility commissions which for example establish the rates which may be charged and the appropriate rate of return on an approved asset base which must be approved by the state commissions certain utilities have had difficulty from time to time in persuading regulators who are subject to political pressures to grant rate increases necessary to maintain an adequate return on investment any unexpected limitations could negatively affect the profitability of utilities whose budgets are planned far in advance in addition gas pipeline and distribution companies have had difficulties in adjusting to short and surplus energy supplies enforcing or being required to comply with longterm contracts and avoiding litigation with their customers on the one hand or suppliers on the other recently two california public electric utilities claimed inability to meet their obligations to their suppliers in the deregulated wholesale market for electricity due to regulatory restrictions on their ability to pass increasing costs along to their customers in the retail market these defaults led their wholesale suppliers to threaten to institute involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against the utility companies subsequently one of the utility companies filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter  of the usbankruptcy code of  certain of the issuers of the securities may own or operate nuclear generating facilities governmental authorities may from time to time review existing and impose additional requirements governing the licensing construction and operation of nuclear power plants nuclear generating projects in the electric utility industry have experienced substantial cost increases construction delays and licensing difficulties these have been caused by various factors including inflation high financing costs required design changes and rework allegedly faulty construction objections by groups and governmental officials limits on the ability to finance reduced forecasts of energy requirements and economic conditions this experience indicates that the risk of significant cost increases delays and licensing difficulties remain present until completion and achievement of commercial operation of any nuclear project also nuclear generating units in service have experienced unplanned outages or extensions of scheduled outages due to equipment problems or new regulatory requirements sometimes followed by a significant delay in obtaining regulatory approval to return to service a major accident at a nuclear plant anywhere could cause the imposition of limits or prohibitions on the operation construction or licensing of nuclear units in view of the uncertainties discussed above there can be no assurance that any utility companys share of the full cost of nuclear units under construction ultimately will be recovered in rates or the extent to which a company could earn an adequate return on its investment in such units the likelihood of a significantly adverse event occurring in any of the areas of concern described above varies as does the potential severity of any adverse impact it should be recognized however that one or more of such adverse events could occur and individually or collectively could have a material adverse impact on a companys financial condition the results of its operations its ability to make interest and principal payments on its outstanding debt or to pay dividends other general problems of the electric gas and water utility industries including state and local joint action power agencies include rising costs of rail transportation to transport fossil fuels the uncertainty of transmission service costs for both interstate and intrastate transactions changes in tax laws which adversely affect a utilitys ability to operate profitably increased competition in service costs recent reductions in estimates of future demand for electricity and gas in certain areas of the country restrictions on operations and increased cost and delays attributable to environmental considerations uncertain availability and increased cost of capital unavailability of fuel for electric generation at reasonable prices including the steady rise in fuel costs and the costs associated with conversion to alternate fuel sources such as coal availability and cost of natural gas for resale technical and cost factors and other problems associated with construction licensing regulation and operation of nuclear facilities for electric generation including among other considerations the problems associated with the use of radioactive materials and the disposal of radioactive wastes and the effects of energy and environmental conservation efforts each of the problems referred to could adversely affect the ability of the issuers of any securities to make dividend payments and the value of such securities on redemption of your units taxable municipal issues the trusts may include certain types of bonds described below accordingly an investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds the types of bonds included in each trust are described under portfolio diversification in the summary of essential financial information of the related prospectus part i neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any of the bonds certain of the bonds may be general obligations of a governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity all other bonds in the trusts are revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuers power to levy taxes general obligation bonds are secured by the issuers pledge of its faith credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds on the other hand are payable only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or in some cases from the proceeds of a special excise tax or other specific revenue source there are of course variations in the security of the different bonds in a trust both within a particular classification and between classifications depending on numerous factors certain of the bonds may be obligations which derive their payments from mortgage loans certain of such housing bonds may be fha insured or may be single family mortgage revenue bonds issued for the purpose of acquiring from originating financial institutions notes secured by mortgages on residences located within the issuers boundaries and owned by persons of low or moderate income mortgage loans are generally partially or completely prepaid prior to their final maturities as a result of events such as sale of the mortgaged premises default condemnation or casualty loss because these bonds are subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole or in part from such prepayments of mortgage loans a substantial portion of such bonds will probably be redeemed prior to their scheduled maturities or even prior to their ordinary call dates extraordinary mandatory redemption without premium could also result from the failure of the originating financial institutions to make mortgage loans in sufficient amounts within a specified time period additionally unusually high rates of default on the underlying mortgage loans may reduce revenues available for the payment of principal of or interest on such mortgage revenue bonds these bonds were issued under section a of the internal revenue code which section contains certain requirements relating to the use of the proceeds of such bonds in order for the interest on such bonds to retain its taxexempt status in each case the issuer of the bonds has covenanted to comply with applicable requirements and bond counsel to such issuer has issued an opinion that the interest on the bonds is exempt from federal income tax under existing laws and regulations certain issuers of housing bonds have considered various ways to redeem bonds they have issued prior to the stated first redemption dates for such bonds in connection with the housing bonds held by a trust the sponsor at the date of deposit is not aware that any of the respective issuers of such bonds are actively considering the redemption of such bonds prior to their respective stated initial call dates certain of the bonds may be health care revenue bonds ratings of bonds issued for health care facilities are often based on feasibility studies that contain projections of occupancy levels revenues and expenses a facilitys gross receipts and net income available for debt service may be affected by future events and conditions including among other things demand for services and the ability of the facility to provide the services required physicians confidence in the facility management capabilities competition with other health care facilities efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates legislation establishing state ratesetting agencies expenses the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance the funding of medicare medicaid and other similar third party pay or programs government regulation and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance including that associated with medicare medicaid and other similar third party pay or programs certain of the bonds may be obligations of public utility issuers including those selling wholesale and retail electric power and gas general problems of such issuers would include the difficulty in financing large construction programs in an inflationary period the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation in addition federal state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to time review existing and impose additional regulations governing the licensing construction and operation of nuclear power plants which may adversely affect the ability of the issuers of certain of the bonds to make payments of principal andor interest on such bonds certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the sale of water andor sewerage services such bonds are generally payable from user fees the problems of such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases population decline resulting in decreased user fees the difficulty of financing large construction programs the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the increasing difficulty of obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water the effect of conservation programs and the impact of nogrowth zoning ordinances certain of the bonds may be industrial revenue bonds irbs irbs have generally been issued under bond resolutions pursuant to which the revenues and receipts payable under the arrangements with the operator of a particular project have been assigned and pledged to purchasers in some cases a mortgage on the underlying project may have been granted as security for the irbs regardless of the structure payment of irbs is solely dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or corporate guarantor corporate operators or guarantors may be affected by many factors which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular company or industry these include cyclicality of revenues and earnings regulatory and environmental restrictions litigation resulting from accidents or environmentallycaused illnesses extensive competition and financial deterioration resulting from a corporate restructuring pursuant to a leveraged buyout takeover or otherwise such a restructuring may result in the operator of a project becoming highly leveraged which may impact on such operators creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating andor market value of such bonds further the possibility of such a restructuring may have an adverse impact on the market for and consequently the value of such bonds even though no actual takeover or other action is ever contemplated or effected certain of the bonds may be obligations that are secured by lease payments of a governmental entity hereinafter called lease obligations lease obligations are often in the form of certificates of participation although the lease obligations do not constitute general obligations of the municipality for which the municipalitys taxing power is pledged a lease obligation is ordinarily backed by the municipalitys covenant to appropriate for and make the payments due under the lease obligation however certain lease obligations contain nonappropriation clauses which provide that the municipality has no obligation to make lease payments in future years unless money is appropriated for such purpose on a yearly basis a governmental entity that enters into such a lease agreement cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for and make lease payments but covenants to take such action as is necessary to include any lease payments due in its budgets and to make the appropriations therefor a governmental entitys failure to appropriate for and to make payments under its lease obligation could result in insufficient funds available for payment of the obligations secured thereby although nonappropriation lease obligations are secured by the leased property disposition of the property in the event of foreclosure might prove difficult certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers which are or which govern the operation of schools colleges and universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem taxes or for higher education systems from tuition dormitory revenues grants and endowments general problems relating to school bonds include litigation contesting the state constitutionality of financing public education in part from ad valorem taxes thereby creating a disparity in educational funds available to schools in wealthy areas and schools in poor areas litigation or legislation on this issue may affect the sources of funds available for the payment of school bonds in the trusts general problems relating to college and university obligations include the prospect of a declining percentage of the population consisting of college age individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased operating costs the uncertainty of continued receipt of federal grants and state funding and government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or costs of such issuers certain of the bonds in certain of the trusts may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of facilities such as airports bridges turnpikes port authorities convention centers and arenas the major portion of an airports gross operating income is generally derived from fees received from signatory airlines pursuant to use agreements which consist of annual payments for leases occupancy of certain terminal space and service fees airport operating income may therefore be affected by the ability of the airlines to meet their obligations under the use agreements from time to time the air transport industry has experienced significant variations in earnings and traffic due to increased competition excess capacity increased costs deregulation traffic constraints and other factors and several airlines have experienced severe financial difficulties similarly payment on bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues from the projects such as user fees from ports tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings therefore payment may be adversely affected by reduction in revenues due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance decreased use of a facility lower cost of alternative modes of transportation scarcity of fuel and reduction or loss of rents certain of the bonds may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource recovery facilities resource recovery facilities are designed to process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity resource recovery bonds may be subject to extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain circumstances including but not limited to destruction or condemnation of a project contracts relating to a project becoming void unenforceable or impossible to perform changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation of a project or technological or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the operation of a project and administrative or judicial actions which render contracts relating to the projects void unenforceable or impossible to perform or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities the sponsor cannot predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of resource recovery bonds in a trust prior to the stated maturity of the bonds zero coupon bonds certain of the bonds in the trust may be zero coupon bonds zero coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not receive any periodic interest payments the effect of owning deep discount bonds which do not make current interest payments such as the zero coupon bonds is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also in effect on all discount earned during the life of such income on the bond at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the discount bond but at the same time eliminates the holders ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future for this reason zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than are securities of comparable quality which pay interest insurance on the bonds insurance has been obtained by the trust by the issuer of bonds in the trust by a prior owner of such bonds or by the sponsor prior the deposit of such bonds guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and principal when due in respect of the bonds in such trust see the trustobjective and bond selection in prospectus part ii each insurance policy obtained by the trust is noncancelable and will continue in force so long as such trust is in existence the respective portfolio insurer is still in business and the bonds described in such policy continue to be held by such trust nonpayment of premiums on a policy obtained by the trust will not result in the cancellation of insurance but will force the insurer to take action against the trustee to recover premium payments due it the trustee in turn will be entitled to recover such payments from such trust premium rates for each issue of bonds protected by the policy obtained by the trust are fixed for the life of the trust the premium for any insurance policy or policies obtained by an issuer of bonds has been paid by such issuer and any such policy or policies are noncancelable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the portfolio insurer remains in business if the provider of an original issuance insurance policy is unable to meet its obligations under such policy or if the rating assigned to the claimspaying ability of any such insurer deteriorates the portfolio insurers have no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected by either of the above described events the aforementioned trust insurance guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on the bonds as they fall due for the purposes of the portfolio insurance when due generally means the stated maturity date for the payment of principal and interest however in the event a an issuer of an a bond defaults in the payment of principal or interest on such bond b such issuer enters into a bankruptcy proceeding or c the maturity of such bond is accelerated the portfolio insurer involved has the option in its sole discretion for a limited period of time after receiving notice of the earliest to occur of such a default bankruptcy proceeding or acceleration to pay the outstanding principal amount of such bond plus accrued interest to the date of such payment and thereby retire the bond from the trust prior to such bonds stated maturity date the insurance does not guarantee the market value of the bonds or the value of the units insurance obtained by a trust is only effective as to bonds owned by and held in such trust in the event of a sale of any such bond by the trustee such insurance terminates as to such bond on the date of sale pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of the portfolio insurers the trustee upon the sale of a bond covered under a portfolio insurance policy obtained by the trust has the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to such bond ie insurance to maturity of the bonds regardless of the identity of the holder thereof the permanent insurance upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium and any expenses related thereto from the proceeds of the sale of such bond accordingly any bond in the trust is eligible to be sold on an insured basis it is expected that the trustee would exercise the right to obtain permanent insurance only if upon such exercise the trust would receive net proceeds sale of bond proceeds less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the permanent insurance from such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such bonds were sold on an uninsured basisthe insurance premium with respect to each bond eligible for permanent insurance would be determined based upon the insurability of each bond as of the date of deposit and would not be increased or decreased for any change in the creditworthiness of each bond the sponsor believes that the permanent insurance option provides an advantage to the trust in that each bond insured by a trust insurance policy may be sold out of the trust with the benefits of the insurance attaching thereto thus the value of the insurance if any at the time of sale can be realized in the market value of the bond so sold which is not the case in connection with any value attributable to such trusts portfolio insurance see public offeringoffering price in prospectus part ii because any such insurance value may be realized in the market value of the bond upon the sale thereof upon exercise of the permanent insurance option the sponsor anticipates that a in the event the trust were to be comprised of a substantial percentage of bonds in default or significant risk of default it is much less likely that the trust would need at some point in time to seek a suspension of redemptions of units than if the trust were to have no such option see rights of unitholdersredemption of units in prospectus part ii and b at the time of termination of the trust if the trust were holding defaulted bonds or bonds in significant risk of default the trust would not need to hold such bonds until their respective maturities in order to realize the benefits of the trusts portfolio insurance see trust administrationtermination of trust agreement in prospectus part ii except as indicated below insurance obtained by the trust has no effect on the price or redemption value of units it is the present intention of the evaluator to attribute a value for such insurance including the right to obtain permanent insurance for the purpose of computing the price or redemption value of units if the bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default the value of the insurance will be equal to the difference between i the market value of a bond which is in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default assuming the exercise of the right to obtain permanent insurance less the insurance premium and related expenses attributable to the purchase of permanent insurance

insured trust bonds must be insured by one of the preinsured bond insurers or be eligible for the insurance being obtained by such trust in determining eligibility for insurance the preinsured bond insurers and the portfolio insurers have applied their own standards which correspond generally to the standards they normally use in establishing the insurability of new issues of municipal bonds and which are not necessarily the criteria used in the selection of bonds by the sponsor to the extent the standards of the preinsured bond insurers and the portfolio insurers are more restrictive than those of the sponsor the previously stated trust investment criteria have been limited with respect to the bonds this decision is made prior to the date of deposit as debt obligations not eligible for insurance are not deposited in an insured trust thus all of the bonds in the portfolios of the insured trusts in the fund are insured either by the respective trust or by the issuer of the bonds by a prior owner of such bonds or by the sponsor prior to the deposit of such bonds in a trust an objective of portfolio insurance obtained by the trust is to obtain a higher yield on the trust portfolio than would be available if all the bonds in such portfolio had standard  poors aaa rating and yet at the same time to have the protection of insurance of prompt payment of interest and principal when due as more fully described above on the bonds there is of course no certainty that this result will be achieved in the event of nonpayment of interest or principal when due as more fully described above in respect of a bond the appropriate insurer shall make such payment within  days after it has been notified that such nonpayment has occurred the appropriate insurer as regards any payment it may make will succeed to the rights of the trustee in respect thereof the information relating to the insurers has been furnished by the respective insurers the financial information with respect to the insurers appears in reports filed with state insurance regulatory authorities and is subject to audit and review by such authorities no representation is made herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information or as to the absence of material adverse changes in such information subsequent to the dates thereof portfolio administration the trustee is empowered to sell for the purpose of redeeming units tendered by any unitholder and for the payment of expenses for which funds may not be available such of the bonds designated by the evaluator as the trustee in its sole discretion may deem necessary the evaluator in designating such bonds will consider a variety of factors including a interest rates b market value and c marketability to the extent that bonds are sold which are current in payment of principal and interest in order to meet redemption requests and defaulted bonds are retained in the portfolio in order to preserve the related insurance protection applicable to said bonds the overall quality of the bonds remaining in the trusts portfolio will tend to diminish the sponsor is empowered but not obligated to direct the trustee to dispose of bonds in the event of an advanced refunding the sponsor is required to instruct the trustee to reject any offer made by an issuer of any of the bonds to issue new bonds in exchange or substitution for any bond pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan except that the sponsor may instruct the trustee to accept or reject such an offer or to take any other action with respect thereto as the sponsor may deem proper if  the issuer is in default with respect to such bond or  in the written opinion of the sponsor the issuer will probably default with respect to such bond in the reasonably foreseeable future any bond so received in exchange or substitution will be held by the trustee subject to the terms and conditions of the trust agreement to the same extent as bonds originally deposited thereunder within five days after the deposit of obligations in exchange or substitution for underlying bonds the trustee is required to give notice thereof to each unitholder identifying the bonds eliminated and the bonds substituted therefor except as stated herein and under trust administrationreplacement bonds in prospectus part ii regarding the substitution of replacement bonds for failed bonds the acquisition by the trust of any bonds other than the bonds initially deposited is not permitted if any default in the payment of principal or interest on any bond occurs and no provision for payment is made therefor either pursuant to the portfolio insurance or otherwise within  days the trustee is required to notify the sponsor thereof if the sponsor fails to instruct the trustee to sell or to hold such bonds within  days after notification by the trustee to the sponsor of such default the trustee may in its discretion sell the defaulted bond and not be liable for any depreciation or loss thereby incurred

creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt bond this assessment of creditworthiness may take into consideration obligors such as guarantors insurers or lessees the bond rating is not a recommendation to purchase or sell a security inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price the ratings are based on current information furnished to standard  poors by the issuer and obtained by standard  poors from other sources it considers reliable the ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information the ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations i likelihood of paymentcapacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the obligation ii nature of and provisions of the obligation iii protection afforded by and relative position of the bond in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangements under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights aaathis is the highest rating assigned by standard  poors the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong aaan obligation rated aa differs from the highestrated obligations only in small degree the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong aan obligation rated a is somewhat more susceptible to adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higherrated categories however the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still strong bbban obligation rated bbb exhibits adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation plus  or minus  the ratings from aa to bbb may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories provisional ratings a provisional rating p assumes the successful completion of the project financed by the debt being rated and indicates that payment of debt service requirements is largely or entirely dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the project this rating however while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion of the project makes no comment on the likelihood of or the risk of default upon failure of such completion the investor should exercise his own judgement with respect to such likelihood and risk moodys investors service inc a brief description of the applicable moodys rating symbols and their meanings follows aaabonds which are rated aaa are judged to be the best quality they carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as gilt edge interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure while the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues aabonds which are rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa securities or fluctuations of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the longterm risks appear somewhat larger than in aaa securities abonds which are rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future baabonds which are rated baa are considered as medium grade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payment and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well moodysr applies numerical modifiers   and  in each generic rating classification from aa through b in its corporate bond rating system the modifier  indicates that the security ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category the modifier  indicates a midrange ranking and the modifier  indicates that the issue ranks in the lower end of its generic rating category contents of posteffective amendment to registration
