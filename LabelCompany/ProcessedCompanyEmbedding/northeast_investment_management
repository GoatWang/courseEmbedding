“fund” has sought to help shareholders build and preserve wealth the fund has survived market fluctuations wide economic swings and a myriad of domestic and foreign political upheavals our mission has always been to consider first and foremost the longterm interest of our shareholders in keeping with this mission on may   the board of trustees of the fund the “board” approved the involuntary redemption of all the fund’s shares outstanding as of june   the board also approved the subsequent liquidation and dissolution of the fund for some time the fund’s investment advisor northeast management and research co inc the “advisor” and the board have been monitoring the fund’s size and have taken many steps to reduce the fund’s expenses the death of billy oates the sole owner of the advisor and president of the fund accelerated this discussion the board approved an interim contract allowing the advisor to continue managing the fund through july   however in order to continue managing the fund after that date a meeting of the shareholders and subsequent vote to approve a new investment advisory agreement is required the estimated cost of this effort would be high relative to the size of the fund and such cost would be borne by the fund’s shareholders the advisor and the board considered alternatives to the fund’s liquidation including the possibility of the advisor’s acquisition and the fund’s combination with another mutual fund but the board determined that the fund’s liquidation was in the best interests of the shareholders additionally as you the shareholder know the fund is not part of a larger fund complex it is a standalone fund that does not afford investors different investment opportunities making it less attractive to new investors finally increasing regulatory burdens and associated costs of operating mutual funds have made it very difficult for the fund to compete with larger funds that have the scale to manage these costs after careful consideration the advisor recommended liquidation to the board and the board concluded that liquidation was in the best interest of the shareholders prior to june   shareholders may continue to redeem their shares at their net asset value in accordance with the procedures set forth in the fund’s prospectus all shareholders will receive a package in the mail which will include this letter and a transaction request form with instructions on how to redeem their shares ira owners will receive this letter and an ira distribution form plus additional information regarding their redemption options all shares that are not redeemed prior to june   will be involuntarily redeemed at their net asset value on that date without any approval or action of shareholders we thank you for the time
