fibrosis and ion channel research research summary michael welshs research focuses on cystic fibrosis and airway epithelia and on asic channels and acidosis in neuronal function his laboratory performs fundamental investigation and carries the work to humans cystic fibrosis and airway epithelia cystic fibrosis cf is a common lethal genetic disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cf transmembrane conductance regulator cftr cftr is an anion channel located in the apical membrane of epithelia where it mediates transepithelial salt transport our lab is interested in the mechanisms that control cftr gating how mutations disrupt cftr function the pathophysiology of airway disease and the development of new therapies cftr cftr belongs to the atpbinding cassette abc transporter family and contains its defining features including two nucleotidebinding domains like other abc transporters cftr can hydrolyze atp we discovered however that cftr also has intrinsic adenylate kinase activity atp  amp — adp  adp that regulates channel gating at physiologic nucleotide concentrations this is the predominant enzymatic reaction we are investigating basic mechanisms that control cftr gating and exploring potential new therapeutic targets figure  pancreatic duct from a cft–– pig image shows mucous cell hyperplasia in the epithelium and a lumen occluded by mucus and zymogen material from rogers cs et al  science 7–   american association for the advancement of science figure  bitter taste receptor on cilia emerging from airway epithelia threedimensional surface view of airway epithelia nuclei are blue cilia are green and the bitter taste receptor tr is red from shah as et al  science –   american association for the advancement of science     cftr dysfunction the most common cfassociated mutation is deletion of phenylalanine at residue  cftrδf this mutation causes cftr retention in the endoplasmic reticulum er and subsequent degradation and it decreases the rate of channel opening our discovery that a reduced incubation temperature allows some cftr∆f to escape the er and reach the cell surface where it retains partial activity sparked efforts to understand the responsible mechanisms and target the defect pharmacologically we are using biochemical and electrophysiological methods to understand how altered cftrδf structure disrupts processing and gating pathogenesis of cf airway infection bacterial airway infections cause most cf morbidity and mortality in earlier work we discovered that a soup of antimicrobials in airway surface liquid defends the lung when this defense is breached bacteria develop into biofilms which makes them resistant to antibiotics and prevents their eradication our lab is pursuing a basic understanding of the mechanisms of pulmonary host defense interactions between bacteria and the host and novel strategies to prevent and treat airway infection a porcine model of cf the initiation and evolution of disease in cf organs remain poorly understood unfortunately mice with targeted cftr gene alterations fail to develop disease typically found in humans to generate a new cf model we chose pigs because when compared to mice their anatomy biochemistry and physiology are more similar to those of humans using homologous recombination we disrupted the cftr gene in primary fibroblasts and collaborated with randall prather university of missouri for somatic cell nuclear transfer to generate cftr–– pigs these animals exhibit defective cl– transport and develop meconium ileus an intestinal obstruction exocrine pancreatic destruction and focal biliary cirrhosis replicating abnormalities seen in cf babies figure  like the lungs of humans with cf their lungs appeared normal at birth we also introduced the ∆f mutation into the porcine cftr gene except for mice these are the first genetargeted mammals produced to model a human disease they offer an exciting opportunity to test for the first time key hypotheses about pathogenesis to study the common cf mutation and to develop new therapeutic strategies we are pursuing several key questions about pathogenesis including the role of defective electrolyte transport and abnormal airway surface liquid and the chicken and egg conundrum about whether inflammation or infection comes first in cf lungs our data also suggest that the structure of mucus is abnormal in cf and we are focusing on the responsible mechanisms although we can treat meconium ileus with surgery we are using transgenic and outcrossed pigs to take several novel approaches to circumvent the obstruction the results should inform us about the pathogenesis of meconium ileus and help us identify genetic modifiers that affect disease severity andor processing of ∆f protein we will also ask whether cftr expression in utero prevents disease in newborns and whether expressing cftr will treat established airway disease the answers will guide therapeutic strategies airway epithelia airway epithelia are covered by motile cilia which propel mucus from the lung in contrast to motile cilia primary cilia are sensory organelles containing a variety of receptors because motile and primary cilia share some molecular features and because our data indicate that they share diseaseassociated features we asked whether classic motile cilia also function as sensory organelles we found that airway epithelial cells express bitter taste receptors that are localized on motile cilia figure  bitter compounds increase intracellular ca concentration and stimulate ciliary beating thus airway epithelia contain a cellautonomous system in which motile cilia both sense noxious substances and initiate a defensive mechanical mechanism to eliminate the offending compound hence like primary cilia classical motile cilia contain sensors to detect the external environment we are pursuing the biochemical and physiological consequences of these structures and are testing the implications for airway disease in mice and humans asics and their regulation by extracellular ph acidsensing ion channels asics are nonvoltagegated cation channels formed from homo and heterotrimers of asic subunits they are activated by a reduced extracellular ph in peripheral neurons they contribute to mechanosensation and nociception in central neurons they and their associated proteins localize in dendritic spines and contribute to synaptic plasticity contribution of asics to diseasethe association between central nervous system cns disease and acidosis led to collaborations to study mouse models of ischemia and multiple sclerosis these diseases produce cns acidosis increasing asica activity disease severity in both models was reduced by disrupting the asica gene or inhibiting asica suggesting exciting therapeutic strategies although most seizures stop spontaneously the molecular mechanisms that stop them remain unknown however seizures are known to reduce brain ph and acidosis has been suggested to inhibit seizures because asica is exquisitely sensitive to extracellular ph we hypothesized that acidosis might activate asica to terminate seizures we found that asica does not affect seizure threshold or onset but it shortens seizure duration and prevents progression co inhalation long known to lower brain ph and inhibit seizures also requires asica to interrupt seizures acidosis activates inhibitory interneurons through asica suggesting that asica might limit seizures by increasing inhibitory tone these findings provide some of the first insights into the mechanisms terminating seizures asica chemosensory function in the amygdala asica is particularly abundant in fear circuit structures especially the lateral amygdala and is required for normal fear behavior which suggested that the amygdala might detect a reduced phwe found that inhaling co reduced mouse brain ph and evoked fear behavior eliminating or inhibiting asica impaired this activity and localized asica expression in the amygdala rescued the coinduced fear deficit of asicanull animals reducing amygdala ph reproduced the effect of cothese data identify the amygdala as an important chemosensor that detects hypercarbia and acidosis and initiates behavioral responses they also give a molecular and anatomical explanation for how rising co concentrations elicit intense fear and provide a foundation for dissecting the bases of anxiety and panic disorders we are investigating three important questions first what is the role of asics in determining the response to ph second how does cns ph change with neural activity third what are the neuropsychiatric consequences of variations in human asic or other genes involved in ph control and response answering these and related questions will provide a better understanding of phdependent signaling in the brain and its contribution to anxiety panic disorder and other neuropsychiatric conditions this research is also
