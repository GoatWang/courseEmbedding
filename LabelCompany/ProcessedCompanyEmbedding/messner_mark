see the company expand exponentially over the years he became leader of the us subsidiary in september  and helps keep his team at the forefront of innovation creativity and productivity three questions with mark  how does your team generate new ideas our team is made up of really passionate people who strive to do things better the folks that work for me are very critical of ideas the products in the marketplace and we all have a desire to make the consumer happy this generates many passionate discussions amongst team members that ultimately make everyone vested in project vision and direction take car seats for example the installation of them can be one of the most threatening tasks on the to do list and parents can become easily overwhelmed you’ve got to make that experience as easy as possible for mom and dad when it comes down to installation of car seats we have one of the easiest installations on the market plus our convertible car seat adjusts to the baby’s growth so when families buy our products they’re making a great investment for the safety of their kids we use an innovative technology the supercinch™ which is a force multiplier that connects to the vehicle latch lower anchors and tethers for children to get the car seat installed rock solid this helps to optimize performance of the car seat  how do you identify trends what resources does your team use to spot trends and consumer insights we buy a lot of competitive products and we actually do qualitative and quantitative research on those products to see what the features are that make the consumers chose a winning product we mix our products into those studies to make sure we’re going to win this ambitious attitude gives us confidence we do extensive research and fashion is a huge component we like to play off our italian heritage we go to shows in europe to explore how fashion can translate into baby gear what’s worked for us is to cluster our products into fashion collections to make buying easier consumers like things that match or come in a collection our customer research has shown us how big a role fashion plays in all other areas of the industry a baby carrier for instance is an extension of your personality it needs to be a fashion forward item that looks cool and hip we also appeal to male marketing as dads are becoming more of a part in baby caretaking we want to encourage them  looking to the future how is chicco usa artsana going to be a leader in innovation innovation is expensive we invest heavily in it as well as product development within the next year we plan to add more people to our staff to help peak innovation – it’s the lifeblood of our company we believe that the product is king and we’re poised for great growth in the future there are lots of categories for us to get into we’re gear oriented but we participate in other areas too we’ve recently launched feeding and soothing bottles pacifiers and accessories and we’ve had a really positive reaction to our new clothing line at the end of the day it comes down to the need to be good storytellers our marketing team does a great job with the materials they’ve put out and the story they’re telling for us references artsana and linkedin featured cosmetic play modern fashionistas crave a more playful take on  more nutritional rearing weary of sedentary lifestyles

call over to mark messner mark mark messner thanks chris and good morning everyone we appreciate you joining our first quarter conference call ill start by giving an overview of recent developments after which bill will go through our financial results in detail weve had a busy start to  and are generally pleased with how the year is shaping up revenue in the first quarter was  million an improvement over q but was down slightly yearoveryear due to general weakness across brick and mortar space with offsetting strength across our ecommerce channels as ill review in a moment we saw slower sales across some product lines in particular which we are currently working to reinvigorate that said we posted strong gross margins of  so improving demand trends as the quarter progressed and posted earnings of a penny per share which makes us feel cautiously optimistic about the rest of  now let me review what weve been doing to bolster the companys goforward growth plan first were taking steps to reorganize how we operate both internally and externally with regards to the latter i discussed last quarter how summer infant was taking more proactive strategic approach to its customer relationships in terms of building the companys brands and strengthening their appeal across the various points of sale we served were looking at ways to connect with our channel partners in a more productive fashion so that our brands are a winwin for both us and our customers which should result in higher demand and increased margins going forward this involves reducing the number of third party wholesalers and taking consumer research more seriously along with revamping how we approach product development meaning the internal side of this equation weve regrouped internal functions to position us for growth including realigning product development marketing and sales to streamline our gotomarket strategy this has meant letting certain people go even as we invest in specific new hires and processes in essence were moving away from a business category structure and reorganize along functional lines of expertise the goal of these internal changes are multifaceted we intend to speed the process of bringing new concepts to market provide the right products to the right customers and hold our client managers accountable throughout the world we expect these actions will result in an organization that is both more nimble and customerfocused and this is just the beginning the reality is that a company like us must constantly evolve not only to meet the product needs of the market but also the market changes themselves by which i mean the significant shift currently playing out in terms of purchase behavior there have been numerous articles written recently about the accelerating move for online purchasing with resulting negative impact hitting brick and mortar stores hard some analysts even see this as an implosion of the retail experience a sea change that is causing a cascading number of store closures around the globe we understand this and are not sitting still we know our customers well and we know how to adapt to the challenges going forward each of our brick and mortar partners has different issues they are facing as well as various strategies being undertaken to address them so while were certainly putting more emphasis on ecommerce platforms were also working with our retail customers to ensure our products bettermatch the demographics they serve were looking to broaden our brands and strengthen them by using various product styles and derivatives suited solely to certain channels and specific retail companies this reduces product overlap and price sensitivity builds loyalty with our customers and provides flexibility to address market dynamics we have already started making some of these changes and our retail partners have responded well to this innovative strategy so im excited about the rest of  as i said earlier were taking action both internally to structure our organization and externally in how we approach our channel partners and marketing initiatives the end result should be a company thats better aligned with its customers and adapt more rapidly to changes and consumer demand and has strong differentiated brands all resulting in higher top line growth and margins from a product development perspective were investing in areas that offer the greatest opportunity for additional market penetration this includes our tried and true monitor business as well as gear safety and swaddle areas and well be rolling out product derivatives as i mentioned earlier that are focused on specific channels and retail partners we serve i think were off to a good start and ive seen a pickup in demand during the latter part of the first quarter which we hope is a sign of things to come while its clearly too early to predict how the year will play out were cautiously optimistic that we should see sequential sales growth going forward along with continued strong margins higher top line results will still be closely tied to online sales as well as international expansion were adding resources to expand overseas with a particular emphasis on europe and asia and expect our shipments to increase this year overall we are taking nothing for granted given the everchanging demand dynamics in the retail industry well continue to make summer infant a more responsive customerfocused organization and im pleased with what weve already accomplished as well as the outlook going forward we will constantly evolve to meet the challenges of tomorrow with the neverending goal of improving the brand with our consumers and returns for our shareholders with that ill turn it over to bill for our financial results in detail bill bill mote thanks mark and good morning everyone our q and related press release were issued last night in addition to listening to this call i encourage you to review our filings net sales for the first quarter were  million versus  million in the prioryear period revenue was down yearoveryear primarily due to lowerthanexpected sales of our feeding nursery and monitor products partially offset by increased safety and gear sales revenue was negatively impacted by a slowdown in brick and mortar demand as mark just reviewed and we are taking proactive steps to address this in our general strategy going forward gross profit the first quarter of  was  million compared with  million for the first quarter of  and gross margin was  in  versus  in the prior year period the three months ended april   included  in temporary demurrage charges and  in foreign exchange losses with no similar items in the current fiscal year period we continue to work on improving margins across the company selling expenses were at  million in the first quarter of  essentially flat compared with the first quarter of  general and administrative expenses were  million in fiscal  versus  million in fiscal  and general and administrative as a percent of sales declined to  from  in the prioryear period which included  million of litigation costs the associated litigation was settled in december  interest expense was  in the first quarter  versus  last year while depreciation and amortization declined to  million from  million last year the company reported net income of  or  per share in the first quarter of  compared with a net loss of  or  per share in the first quarter of  the current quarter was the third period of positive net income in the past  months our best performance in many years and a sign of improving fundamentals adjusted ebitda for the first quarter was  million versus  million for the first quarter of  adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of  includes  in bank permitted addback charges compared with  million in the prioryear period as defined in our february  amended credit facility turning to the balance sheet as of march   summer infant had approximately  of cash and  million of debt compared with  million of cash and  million of debt on december   inventory as of april   was  million compared with  million as of december   we continue to manage inventory while still having the highest quality merchandise available for sale trade receivables at the end of the first quarter were  million compared with  million as of december   accounts payable and accrued expenses were  million as of april   compared with  million at the beginning of the fiscal year regarding cash flow we used  of cash in operations this quarter versus  million of cash generation in the prior year period working capital remains in check and is down over  from the end of  and we expect cash flow improvement in the quarters to come even as we invest in the product development initiatives mark discussed with that ill turn over the call to the operator and open it up for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions the first question comes from eric beder of wunderlich please go ahead eric beder good morning congratulations on a solid start of the year when you look going forward  first of all what was the split now between online and brick and mortar and where do you see it going forward mark messner well i mean im not going to talk specifically about the split but i mean weve had serious doubledigit growth over  in ecommerce and obviously brick and mortar some of the baby brick and mortar in particular have had a really slow start to the year so we will leverage our ecommerce sales and ship some our marketing programs to leverage sales through that channel eric eric beder okay and in terms of product mix i know youve talked before about the car seat business and thats toward next year is that still a major focus for you in terms of  and beyond mark messner yes we hope to make  i mean car seats arent a short lead time type item but youll definitely see this become more active in gear i mean you know weve been in high chairs and playards and such in the past and maybe havent put as much attention to those but i think there is some opportunities there in the innovation pipeline that were seeing eric beder right and last question when you look how should we be thinking about you put up a lot talk about how you are going to be more innovative and more responsive how should we be thinking about that in terms of product mix going forward looking longer term how should be we seeing will we be seeing less product categories or more product categories how should we be thinking about that mark messner yes i dont see necessarily more product categories but the categories we participate in we have a derivatives strategy that you hadnt seen from summer in the past where we typically bring out a hero item at one price point and sell it into all the different channels at that price point and they do get out online to see who can go the lowest with a new derivative strategy if you have a product with meaningful separation between price points and lets say you have a superseded   and maybe  you can probably have a  one thats appropriate for an entry level partner and a  one for the premium so i think a deeper thought process on our derivative strategy will help us become stronger in the categories we participate in operator operator instructions the next question comes from dave king of roth capital please go ahead dave king thanks good morning guys i had to jump on late so forgive me if you already answered some of these but can you talk a little a bit about what drove the margin expansion in the period and then bill how are you thinking about it shaking out for the rest of the year and what are sort of the key drivers there bill mote yes so margin expansion just compared to last year last year we were facing some currency headwinds so thats a part of it the other part of it is that we have a change in mix of products more to some of our safety items that tend to have in some cases a little bit higher margin we also had a couple of small headwinds this quarter in the margins that drove a little bit of decline so its actually we sold off a little more closeout inventory than we expected it took the margins down by about  more than we had anticipated so overall even with that hit we feel real good about the  and the continue to work on our supply chain to get cost out so that we can get to that at least that  level this year that weve been speaking about for some time so good progress not all the way there yet but were making good progress towards the  dave king okay thats good color and then maybe on the revenue side encouraging that it was up sequentially is it still reasonable to assume growth on a yearonyear basis in the back half and then what are the drivers of that so i think mark maybe we talked in the past about additional shelf space obviously there is new products and then should we still be assuming further exiting of sort of lowprofit accounts i guess what are sort of puts and takes and how are you thinking about the top line shaping up thanks mark messner yes i think were seeing some good positivity here starting the second quarter and some of our initiatives internationally are certainly going to help with top line revenue growth yes i mean were getting incrementality in placement at some of our key retail partners so i think thats a very positive sign as well yes i mean customers like kmart sears with the consolidation of our customer base theres puts and takes there but it feels like youre squeezing sales from one channel right into the bigger channel so i feel good with how that consolidation is going so feeling pretty positive dave king okay thats great fantastic and then maybe just one more for me maybe for bill then on free cash flow i think maybe weve talked about how we should be thinking about cash flow from operations at least what are the sort of thoughts on how that should come in for the year and what are the  i think i saw debt was down a little bit in the quarter i guess what are the updated sort of debt pay down plans as we move forward bill mote debts actually up a little bit its about  million up from q of last year im sorry q of last year but were still targeting midsingledigit operating cash flow and use that cash flow to pay down debt and we kind of had the same path last year but we ended up creating a little more cash flow there again at the end of the year so right now what weve said publically and what i still believe is that well be in that midsingledigit operating cash flow and well use any excess cash to continue to pay down debt im targeting debt paydown somewhere in that midsingledigit range as well for the year dave king okay so midsingledigits in dollar terms right bill mote yes dave king okay fantastic great start to the year good luck with the rest and thanks for taking the question operator operator instructions this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mark messner for any closing remarks mark messner all right thank you everybody for
