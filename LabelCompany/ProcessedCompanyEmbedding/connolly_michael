publication dates httpwwwgoodreadscomauthorshow0annebennett stacon toby neal’s “lei crime” series mel k why no listing for colin cotterill brandon there’s no reason why we don’t have any author on the

and new authors to read wish i had this years ago it is sometimes hard to remember who wrote which character  just great to get on here and surf for hours i am a voracious reader  books a week sometimes so always looking for new to me authors to read my favorite is alex cross michael bennett series i don’t normally read books with coauthors with the exception of lee child and douglas preston so i am glad i tried michael bennett series… otherwise james patterson is my favorite when he writes alone mc beaton’s hamish mc beth diana gabaldan  only historical books i have read  jan karon andrew greely both kellerman’s ian rankin robert parker could go on for hours like all kinds of books except western sci fi and histerical romances if a book makes me laugh so much better my favorite is mystery novels  but i like series where characters come alive  learn new things about new places places i will never visit but can visualize through books  bob buchanan would like sean black to your list most of his novels are  star eamon love the site opened up a whole new world thank you very much danna cogburn love this wish could have found it sooner patsy laurendine ferrara very helpful site gillian roberts’ amanda pepper series isn’t represented though you may want to consider adding thanks brandon i didn’t see this post until now but gillian is now up and amanda will soon follow cynthia is there a way to search out authors who write action suspense on your site brandon besides writing it in a search box not really unfortunately i’m not sure i’ve ever used that term for a genre but you can look up an author in that genre and maybe there will be others listed with it under “if you like…” adding a genre section to the site is one of my goals but to properly index them would take a long time eamon craig russell should be in there gentlemen carole would like the “midwife” books by sam thomas listed his third one is coming out in january disqusvvchbozzx kathryn le veque i’d love to see her books listed here she has written so many historical medieval romantic adventures max ivan doig writes superb novels but is not in your authors list billr very

thanks to your request sorry for the delay in response bev could you please add cassie laurent brandon added her to our “to do” list thanks and sorry for the delay in response kathi harris what a useful site and tool now on my favorites list jeffrey j parker is there a reason that author john wayne falbey’s series sleeping dogs and endangered species are not listed i just discovered them and at first found it difficult to figure out the sequencing of the various series due to similar titles thus i came to oob for guidance only to find out they are not listed that was disappointing otherwise i love this site although it has made me a bit lazy brandon the only reason would be not enough people have requested him as you just have thanks nancy i’d like to see kristina ludwig’s series of amish fiction novels i think the first one is amish baby i’d like to see her novels on this site thank you brandon thanks nancy mark great site i go to it often can you list jess walter thanks brandon thanks for the suggestion a dogster member i can’t believe i’m the first to say this and i’m sorry to feel the need because i really do appreciate all you’ve done on this site for those who love serial books this is awesome but when your listing authors or books alphabetically it would make a whole lot of sense to give us a – z links to jump nearer to what we are searching for than simply giving us a numerical page list and making us guess as to how far in our author or book might be thereby having to wade through pages and pages of stuff to get there like the example below brandon sorry to say but you’re not the first person to say that 🙂 we’d love to add a system like this in the future a dogster member looking forward to that day it’s really isn’t difficult to do just requires a bit of time some shifting and renaming of pages a dogster member now that said i can’t find sax rohmer real name henry ward a prolific english novelist he is best remembered for his series of novels featuring the master criminal dr fu manchu but he wrote others too i’ve looked under both sax henry and dr if i’ve overlooked it somehow would you please steer me to it brandon we’d love to have every author ever available on this site but unfortunately we can only do one at a time if we’re expected to have any sort of quality whatsoever your request has been acknowledged and sax has been moved closer to the top of our “to do” list a dogster member thank you brandon robeb love your site please add author john mortimer and his horace rumpole books thanks bluesilver just discovered
