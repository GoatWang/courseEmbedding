companys website at wwwdaktronicscom operator instructions i would now like to turn the conference over to our host for today ms sheila anderson chief financial officer for daktronics for introductory remarks please go ahead maam sheila mae anderson thank you operator good morning everyone thank you for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call i would like to review our disclosures cautioning investors and participants that in addition to statements of historical facts we will be discussing forwardlooking statements reflecting our expectation and plans about our future financial performance and future business opportunities all forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may be out of our control and may cause actual results to differ materially such risks include changes in economic condition changes in the competitive and market landscape management of growth timing and magnitude of future contracts fluctuations of margins the introduction of new products and technology and other important factors as noted in our 0k and 0q sec filings at this time i would like to introduce reece kurtenbach our president and ceo for a few comments reece kurtenbach thanks you sheila good morning everyone we had a positive third quarter with quarteroverquarter increases in both orders and revenues it was nice to see the continued upward trend in our top line but we were really pleased to see the strong order performance this backlog will set us up for a positive q and we believe modest growth for the fiscal year overall with this said our gross profit is lower this fiscal year mainly due to project mix as much as this year has been with large video projects which tend to have lower margins we continue to focus on reducing our cost to fulfill on our project and standard order work through ongoing investments in reliability quality and process improvement through the entire value stream our business is cyclical with our q typically being our weakest quarter for sales influenced by the holiday season in most of our markets as well as natural variations in our different businesses we are positioned for a strong q as our backlog is almost 0 million or about  increase over last year our orders in q were mainly from our large sports businesses as well as our thirdparty advertising business sometimes referred to as outofhome many of these orders are from existing customers and we receive repeat business when these customers have a positive experience with our people our products and individual interactions which accumulate over time i would like to thank the entire daktronics team for their hard work over the years which put us in a position for these recent successes we continue to see strong activity in our different market segments in north america as well as other regions of the world the strongest segments are our large sports venues thirdparty advertising and spectaculars our new stadium construction is down from five years ago the equipment in many existing facilities was installed about 0 years ago which is a typical point when our customers choose to upgrade their systems as an example the three nfl orders in q were from the cleveland browns carolina panthers and jacksonville jaguars all upgrades of existing systems this replacement trend also exists in our billboard business with continued orders for new locations as well as increasingly refurbishment or replacement of existing digital displays while these are the strongest segments we continue to have a positive outlook for our transportation on premise and sports businesses overall markets are still very dynamic and competitive we believe we will need to keep a strong focus on both product development and process improvement to be successful over the longterm in product development we remained focus on leveraging our investments through the creation of product platforms for both display and control systems on the process side we continue to follow lean principles of continuous improvement for both our production and business processes we believe is important to prioritize our activities on the highest value areas through knowledge and understanding of our markets and careful planning between our teams as an example with the order activity and strong backlog we are making targeted investments in factory capacity and flexibility to put us in a position to be successful in our fiscal year 0 with that i will turn it back to sheila for some detail financial comments sheila mae anderson during the quarter we converted  million dollars of sales from some of the third quarter orders and from the  million backlog going into the quarter this equated to a sales increase of about  for the third quarter of fiscal 0 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 0 international commercial and live events sales all increased primarily due to the increase in large video project orders we were able to secure build and deliver transportation and schools and theaters sales decreased as compared to the same quarter last year transportation sales reduction is a result of approximately 0 million of revenue realized last year as we were building and starting the installation of the los angeles airport project we have discussed in the past a great project for us in the business unit but difficult to find a repeat order in the transportation market schools and theaters sales declined as some large video display projects continued to move out or be delayed into calendar 0 the sales also have been concentrated on smaller projects as compared to last year and therefore lower average sales price per order were realized during the quarter our order volume for the third quarter is the highest daktronics has reached in the same quarter the third quarter overall order volume yeartodate is up by  as reece mentioned the order increase was driven by our multimillion dollar orders in three nfl stadiums an increase in order volume in our thirdparty advertising segment and increased orders on our spectacular project in the commercial unit this order volume will help us finish the year with modest sales growth rate overall for fiscal 0 while our second half of the fiscal year has historically been lower in sales and profitability than the first half of the year because of the sports and construction seasonality in our business we were able to increase our operating margin in the third quarter of fiscal 0 as compared to last year by  million with the increase in backlog as compared to last year and the current production and delivery schedules we estimate revenues to be higher than last years fourth quarter of  million we continue to see strong interest from our customers in large projects in the marketplace in the business units of live events international and commercial and transportation schools and theaters demand appears to be flat despite increases gross profit in the third quarter was  compared to  in the third quarter of last year the increase was primarily due to increased manufacturing utilization and sales mix in the fourth quarter we anticipate gross profit to increase a couple of margin points as compared to last years fourth quarter because of volume sales mix and a warranty issue that occurred in last years fourth quarter we do not expect to recur this year larger multimillion dollar contracts generally have lower margins than standard video displays and scoring systems due to the competitive environment as well as the amount of installation contracted work included in these types of projects this will be offset by manufacturing utilization as we are able to produce more through our plants cost infrastructure over the coming quarters warranty expense yeartodate as a percentage of sales was  which is slightly higher than same period last year at  we continue to focus on lowering warranty issues by investing in quality initiatives including manufacturing process improvements supply chain management and robust product design efforts operating expenses were  of sales during the quarter compared to  of sales in the third quarter of fiscal 0 in dollars operating expenses decreased slightly from last years the same quarter primarily due to the timing of thirdparty commissions paid last year on an international order we from time to time use thirdparty on various locations around the world to expand sales opportunities for fiscal 0 we predict a slight increase in operating expense dollars to support business growth but are working to hold these expenses flat or down as a percentage of total sales for the year we continue to work internally on all fronts to improve operating profitability company initiatives include continued focus on reducing warranty expenses by investing in supplier quality program volume reliability equipment and manufacturing process control techniques in addition we continue to work on operational efficiencies throughout all areas of the business to reduce costs and improve services to our customers our tax rate for the quarter was  compared to a benefit last year of  last year we received the benefit during the third quarter for a retroactive restatement of the research and development credit and for a tax protection for a special dividend paid during last years third quarter during the third quarter of fiscal 0 we received benefits from stock option deductions and return to provision trueups we are forecasting our effective tax rate for fiscal 0 to be in the  to  range overall however that rate can fluctuate depending on the tax jurisdiction sales realized in around the world we continue to invest in manufacturing equipment for new product introductions and efficiency improvements we invested in our it infrastructure to maintain our system and we invest in demo equipment for our sales initiatives as the news release stated we are committed to expand manufacturing facility by 00 square feet and estimate the expansion to cost approximately  million most of this capital will be part of our fiscal 0 capital expenditures for fiscal 0 we estimate about  million in capital expenditures to support our business growth and initiatives reece you have further comments reece kurtenbach looking forward we are seeing increased activity in our major segments of sports commercial and transportation businesses worldwide and are optimistic on our future business maybe some comments about these specific segments our commercial business we have seen orders in billboard pick up as we move through calendar year 0 and we feel this will continue through calendar 0 we also have a strong pipeline in the large projects area of our commercial business and see this is a continued growth area as we move into next fiscal year overall we are expecting modest yearoveryear growth in commercial in fy 0 in live events we continue to see ongoing interest from venues at all levels to increase the size and capability of their display systems these customers tend to upgrade after about 0 years and the trend is to install larger systems capable of highdefinition video as well as dynamic digital advertising the largest systems are for the major league stadiums and arenas in the us but this drives interest in video through all other areas of sports and entertainment both in the us and internationally this holds true in our high school sports business as well even though we saw order and revenue decline for this specific market in our current fiscal year we believe this is due to the timing of large video systems and not a longterm trend our thirdparty advertising business continues to be strong internationally we see an increasing shift to digital as prices have come down the expansion of our product line through the acquisition in belgium that we completed in q of 0 has increased our ability to deliver a complete solution to these customers and we continue to win orders and install projects worldwide in general we believe there is a lot of growth potential in our international business our transportation business is still strong and we see the core business continue to grow even though the yearoveryear comparison is down due to the lax projects sheila mentioned earlier overall we are optimistic about the future we continue to focus on our internal goals of improving operating margin we are the world leader in many of our markets we have great products and great people and we continue to make progress in reducing cost through eliminating waste and process improvement and this work is still ongoing we feel we are positioned well to continue to achieve some topline growth and we will maintain our focus on cost reduction and bottomline performance as we go forward and with that i would ask the operator to open up the line for any questions questionandanswer session operator yes sir operator instructions it looks like our first phone question will come from the line of jim ricchiuti with needham  company please go ahead your line is open jim ricchiuti  needham  company hi good morning first question just with respect to the nfl projects my understanding is that the nfl the league has some sort of a capex plan called g which i guess supports upgrades of video and audio projects and i am just wondering are you seeing any activity associated with hits process with the cleveland browns project how do you see that going forward reece kurtenbach well we see that each one of these venues tends to be different so in some venues a government agency is the owner of the facility while the team is a lessor of the facility and sometimes that relationship is different its a blend of venue owner money that goes into these projects versus team money can be different based on the project and the location so i dont believe there is a hard rule of whether its the nfl capex money that goes into these projects or not and most of this work is a blend of display upgrade as well as further stadium improvements so i dont believe there are many instances of finances drawn or financing done just for the display system jim ricchiuti  needham  company got it and just maybe staying on topic on live events can you talk a little bit of the activity you are seeing for the upcoming mlb season in terms of the activity reece kurtenbach most of the activity we saw at major league has been in the nfl and mlb has been a little quieter this year even though the same trends exist when they go to replay really upgrading the overall features and capacity of their system jim ricchiuti  needham  company okay and maybe one final question i will jump back in the queue if we think about q and the kind of sequential increase we might see in revenues would it be more in line with what we saw last year low doubledigit is there any color you can provide on that sheila mae anderson we are estimating a low doubledigit increase over the  million we had last year similar to the fy  year jim ricchiuti  needham  company got it thanks very much operator thank you and our next question will come from morris ajzenman with griffin securities please go ahead your line is now open morris ajzenman  griffin securities can you give us a little color on digital billboards during this quarter as far as the revenue number versus last year will what you put on the there i have ordered numbers available for the year i am just wondering what else you can spin that you can put on that sheila mae anderson so i have order numbers available for the year we are up in digital billboard we are at about  million of orders compared to  million last year at the same time morris ajzenman  griffin securities okay and you mentioned a couple of new locations i know in previous calls you talked about this year being a replacement cycle is the majority of the business again replacements or is the new site location picking up since then reece kurtenbach i would say morris that the majority of the business is still new locations but we are seeing that the amount of spend on replacement or refurbishing of existing sites continues to grow and we believe that is a function of the ramp up seven to 0 years ago of digital billboards that it started slower and then it moved more quickly over time morris ajzenman  griffin securities can you give us an approximation of the  million what percent would be new location versus refurbishing just roughly reece kurtenbach i dont have that number unless sheila you got an indication sheila mae anderson and i dont have that available either morris ajzenman  griffin securities okay and the last thing on the transportation lax refresh me fiscal fourth quarter last year was lax still a large contributor sheila mae anderson it was morris ajzenman  griffin securities and if so by how much sheila mae anderson about another thing 0 million that was sold that was about the 0 million project so we were finishing it up in the fourth and a little bit in the first quarter of the fiscal year morris ajzenman  griffin securities okay so we had another difficult 0 million comparison fourth quarter yearoveryear sheila mae anderson for transportation yes morris ajzenman  griffin securities for transportation yes and very last thing and i will hop back in queue anything you can say about whats going on in led reece kurtenbach in led in general we see that as the go to technology for outdoor in high ambient light environments the led manufacturers are all chasing the general purpose lighting market in various lighting niches so they continue to invest in the base technology of which we are a beneficiary as the products that we use continue to get better and brighter morris ajzenman  griffin securities and was there any additional traction in this most recent quarter on in the coming quarter with led to you guys reece kurtenbach when you are saying additional traction you mean in the base technology or could you give some clarification morris ajzenman  griffin securities well i am just trying to get a handle on it is this contributing more revenue yearoveryear on an ongoing basis now reece kurtenbach our technology has been all led for i would say at least four years now maybe longer morris ajzenman  griffin securities yes actually i am confused more actually what i am referring to when i said led i meant to say on the outside of vegas in the casino you have the  reece kurtenbach like architectural lighting morris ajzenman  griffin securities i am sorry thats what i meant to say i meant to say architectural lighting and i said led i take that back i am specifically referring to architectural lighting i was brain dead there for a moment i apologize reece kurtenbach no thats helpful to provide some more clarification we see that as an ongoing growth area for daktronics an example of a project we did recently is wembley stadium over in london they have been wembley way where the main tube station comes out and people walk up to the stadium we did a large atrium display that targets that audience as it comes i saw it in january it looks beautiful its very nice we see continued interest in projects like that in our pipeline morris ajzenman  griffin securities i guess what i really wanted to ask is in architectural lighting can you bring out revenues for first nine months versus last year do you break that out at all reece kurtenbach we dont break that out currently morris morris ajzenman  griffin securities okay thank you reece kurtenbach thank you operator operator instructions and it looks like our next one question comes from the line of steve altebrando with sidoti  company please go ahead your line is open steve altebrando  sidoti  company good morning it doesnt sound like the backlog includes anything material in the baseball market can you characterize how activity was this year is there some projects out there that you suspect slipped into next year reece kurtenbach yes steve any facility that their equipment starts to age if they choose to not upgrade in this current year for this current season they become a candidate for next season and so it wasnt that there were a number of mlb projects that we just didnt win or were there it was just a quiet year for mlb steve altebrando  sidoti  company okay when does the activity start getting underway for next years nfl in other words what hit your backlog this year at this time reece kurtenbach yes the closer you get to 0 day window the less likely it is that they will be successful on really the size of the systems that they are putting into the nfl so as you get four months before the preseason games thats when that window starts to close steve altebrando  sidoti  company okay and it sounds like the warranty the release mentioned the warranty coming down in the quarter how much area was that and is there further upside for you guys there sheila mae anderson we continue to work on warranty through business that reece mentioned earlier our warranty through the quarter was  compared to yeartodate we are at about  so it was helpful for the quarter on the warranty side steve altebrando  sidoti  company okay and then lastly excluding the mix factors if you could characterize what you think of the margin of the backlog it would be helpful sheila mae anderson we dont have that necessarily but the large projects do as we have talked about historically have a lower gross margins due to the installation factors and thats just the competitive nature of those projects and we have the large projects like reece mentioned in our backlog and we will be working to those in q and in to some more months steve altebrando  sidoti  company okay and maybe i should clarify it a bit if you could maybe characterize the pricing or the competitive environment reece kurtenbach while these markets still are competitive we are not seen a dramatic shift in pricing from last year if thats closer to the mark to your question steve altebrando  sidoti  company yes it is okay thank you operator thank you and presenters at this time it looks like there are no additional questioners in the queue i would like to turn the program back over to management for any additional or closing remarks reece kurtenbach

stephen altebrando  sidoti  company llc robert hoffman operator good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the daktronics fiscal year 0 second quarter earnings results conference call as a reminder this conference is being recorded today tuesday november  0 and is available on the companys website at wwwdaktronicscom operator instructions i would now like to turn the conference over to ms sheila anderson chief financial officer for daktronics for some introductory remarks please go ahead sheila sheila mae anderson thank you kevin good morning everyone thank you for participating in our second quarter and earnings conference call i would like to review our disclosures cautioning investors and participants that in addition to statements of historical facts we will be discussing forwardlooking statements reflecting our expectation and plans about our future financial performance and future business opportunities all forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may be out of our control and may cause actual results to differ materially such risks include changes in economic condition changes in the competitive and market landscape management of growth timing and magnitude of future contracts fluctuations of margins the introduction of new products and technology and other important factors as noted and detailed in our 0k and 0q sec filings at this time i would like to introduce reece kurtenbach our president and ceo for a few comments reece a kurtenbach thanks sheila and welcome everyone to the call overall we had a great second quarter with quarteroverquarter increases in both orders and revenues while our top line was higher our gross profit as a percent of revenue was lower than last year at this time most of the differences in gross profit were due to project mix we had a higher percentage of large video projects which tend have to have a lower margin however warranty can still be a challenge and we remain committed to reducing these expenses over the long term by continued investment in reliability and quality in both our product designs and our production processes our business tends to be cyclical and the summer months are our busiest our teams did a great job in handling this peak volume again this year and i would like to thank all of our employees suppliers and service partners for their hard work over the last quarter we were successful due to their efforts as i said our business is cyclical and our third quarter is typically our lowest in revenue this year our backlog entering the period is slightly higher than last year and our pipeline continues to be strong because of this we believe we will see yearoveryear growth in the second half of fiscal 0 and we continue to have a positive outlook for the year as a whole increases in order volume were mainly in our large video projects we had significant orders in both the sports and commercial segments worldwide however we continue to see strong activity in our billboard and transportation businesses as well we are receiving billboard orders for new locations as well as refurbishment or replacement of existing displays and the release of our fullcolor product for transportation use is a significant factor in our increases in this business segment i would once again point out that the yearoveryear comparison for transportation is down because of a significant order in fy 0 for the new tom bradley terminal in la even though the core business of what we call transportation continues to grow our markets are still very dynamic and competitive we believe we will need to keep a strong focus on both product development and process improvement to be successful over the longterm in product development we remained focus on leveraging our investments through the creation of product platforms for both display and control systems as an example in q we released our new design of millimeter outdoor display systems using surface mount leds and in q we shipped our first derivative of this design a 0millimeter product and we are working on higher resolutions as well on the process side we continue to follow lean principles of continuous improvement for our production and business processes looking forward we are seeing increased activity in our major segments of sports commercial and transportation business worldwide and we are optimistic of our future business some comments on specific segments in our commercial business we see orders in billboard picking up as we move through this calendar year and we now feel this will extend into calendar 0 we also have a strong pipeline in large projects area of this business and we see this area continuing to grow through the fiscal year overall we are expecting modest yearoveryear growth in commercial in our fy 0 in live events we continue to see ongoing interest from venues at all levels to increase the size and capability of their display systems these customers tend to upgrade after about 0 years and the trend is to install larger systems capable of highdefinition video as well as dynamic digital advertising the largest systems are for the major league stadiums and arenas in the us but this drives interest through all other areas of sport and entertainment both in the us and internationally this holds true in our high school sports business as well even though we saw order and revenue decline for this specific market in the yearoveryear comparison we believe this is due to timing of large video systems and not a longterm trend we see continued growth opportunities in each of these markets our thirdparty advertising business continues to be strong internationally we see an increasing shift to digital as technology prices have come down and the expansion of our product line through the acquisition in belgium that we completed in q has increased our ability to deliver a complete solution to these customers and we continue to win orders and install projects worldwide in general we believe theres a lot of growth potential in our international business our transportation is still  business is still strong and we see the core business to continue to grow even though a yearoveryear comparison will be skewed due to the lax project mentioned earlier overall we are optimistic about our future we continue to focus on our internal goals of improving operating margin we are the world leader in many of our markets we have great products great people and we continue to make progress in reducing cost through eliminating waste and improving our processes and this work is still ongoing we feel we are positioned well to continue to achieve some top line growth and we will maintain our focus on cost reduction and bottom line performance as we go forward ill turn it over to sheila sheila mae anderson thank you reece we were pleased to reach a level of sales that is the highest for a quarter since our fiscal year  our plans processes service partners and suppliers and people helped us to convert  million of sales from the  million of backlog we had going into this quarter this equated to a sales increase of  for the second quarter of fiscal 0 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 0 international commercial and live events sales all increased primarily due to the increase in the large video project orders we were able to secure build and deliver transportation and schools and theatres sales decreased as compared to the same quarter last year transportation sales reduction is a result of approximately  million of revenue we realized last year to finish up a procurement contract during the same timeframe without a similar type of project this quarter schools and theatres sales declined as some large video project displays slipped into calendar 0 and the projects we won were smaller projects compared to last year and therefore lower average sales prices were realized per order we continue to estimate a modest growth rate overall for fiscal 0 while our second half has historically been lower in sales and profitability than the first half of the year because of the sports and construction seasonality we do have more optimism in this years second half than last year we continue to see strong interest from our customers and large projects in the marketplace and live events international and commercial business units as reece mentioned with the increase in backlog as compared to last year the current booked project delivery schedules and potential new orders in the third quarter which we anticipate some converting into sales we estimate revenues to trend modestly higher as compared to last years third quarter last year we recognized  million of sales during that quarter gross profit in the second quarter was  compared to  of the second quarter of last year we anticipated a decrease in gross margin percent compared to last year due to the sales mix we had going into the quarter as we work on larger milliondollarplus contracts the margin earned as a percent of sales is lower than our standard video displays and scoring systems thus due to the competitive environment as well as the amount of installation work thats included in these type of projects last years second quarter had a higher volumes of standard orders as compared to this years second quarter where we had more larger contracts work done warranty was  of sales which is slightly higher than the same period last year of  we continue to focus on lowering warranty issues by investing in quality through process improvement supply chain management and product design looking ahead gross profit for the third quarter is expected to be similar to that as of the third quarter of last year and less than the second quarter of this year during this third quarter we have a number of holidays and utilize the plant and infrastructure less causing the projected decline in margin operating expenses were  of sales compared to  of sales in the second quarter of fiscal 0 in dollars operating expenses increased  from last year during the same quarter we plan to continue to make necessary investments in product development process improvements and our it infrastructure while managing costs to allow us to continue to grow profitably for fiscal 0 we predict a slight increase in operating expenses in dollars to support business growth but are working to hold expenses flat to down as a percentage of sales for the total year our tax rate for the quarter was  compared to  last year and this lower rate is reflective of the benefits we received from the research and development credit which is  had not been reinstated last year at this same time we are forecasting our effective tax rate for the fiscal 0 to be approximately in the  range however that rate can fluctuate depending on which tax jurisdiction sales are procured in the world with that operator could you please open the line for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from morris ajzenman with griffin securities morris ajzenman  griffin securities inc research division just a followup sheila on your kind of guidance for the third quarter revenue is up modestly i think you said yearoveryear and down sequentially which is not a surprise being the second quarter is a seasonally high quarter but if you count on gross margins  im looking at the third quarter of last year i think its at  and i think you said it will be similar to last year im just curious shouldnt we see some leveraging with modest top line growth rates theres been a control low warranty expense thats come into play here but shouldnt this still be an improvement in the gross margins going forward into this current quarter sheila mae anderson as discussed there it has to do with mix as well as in our utilization of the factory so yes we will have some uptick because of the revenue uptick but conservatively we feel well be in that area because of the sales mix going into the quarter morris ajzenman  griffin securities inc research division all right and you said utilization  is there any reason to believe utilization in this third quarter is going to be significantly different than last years third quarter sheila mae anderson it shouldnt be significantly different morris ajzenman  griffin securities inc research division okay and just give me a little bit more color on the warranty expense  in this most recent quarter can you just refresh what it was the previous quarter and you still target at getting that the 0  basis points sheila mae anderson we do and are working towards reducing our warranty as a percent of sales and our target is that  or so i dont have last quarters right with me here but we have and want to reduce that from the  that we experienced this quarter operator operator instructions our next question comes from brad mas with needham unknown analyst brad filling in for jim just first regarding the billboard portion of the commercial segment i was wondering if you could provide any revenue or bookings numbers sheila mae anderson for the quarter in revenue we had about  million of sales unknown analyst okay and then orders sheila mae anderson orders were  one moment were about  million unknown analyst okay and then with the international segment theres obviously good growth do you think its sustainable going forward and where  like what segments were you seeing the strength coming from internationally reece a kurtenbach we believe that the growth is sustainable internationally and the biggest segments that we see interest in is the large sports venues these large commercial spectaculars and thirdparty advertising or billboard unknown analyst okay and then just lastly transportation we obviously saw decent order activity do you have any visibility into the pipeline or any opportunities in the transportation segment reece a kurtenbach we do believe that our transportation segment the core business will continue to grow and so were optimistic as we go into the second half that the order and revenue would increase operator our next question comes from steve altebrando with sidoti  company stephen altebrando  sidoti  company llc in the schools and theatres the release mentions asps being down a bit is that a function of mix or pricing competitive pricing sheila mae anderson we believe thats a part of just the mix we feel we were selling smaller display units compared to last year stephen altebrando  sidoti  company llc okay and then the live events segment mentioned i think maybe   i think it was  orders for  million or so it sounds like a relatively small order dollar amount per order are those nonprofessional arenas or ancillary products reece a kurtenbach what we see in the live events business is that orders in q and maybe even part of q tend to be addons not complete system orders and what we find is that in the spring months as we move into baseball and then the fall season is where we get the larger fullsystem orders stephen altebrando  sidoti  company llc okay thats helpful and then just lastly and i know you touched on it on the script a bit but if you could expand on kind of the bidding activity youre seeing in the live events segment just the general interest that youre seeing whether it feels like its picking up as we go into fiscal  reece a kurtenbach weve seen much higher activity this year especially in large outdoor stadiums than in the previous i would say  years and we believe that that will continue into the fall certainly operator our next question comes from morris ajzenman with griffin securities morris ajzenman  griffin securities inc research division sheila you had mentioned in your prepared remarks  and you kind of ran through it quickly im not sure if i got it right transportation did you say  million last year  million was from the lax or did i misread you on that sheila mae anderson actually  million was from another procurement project lax contributed to our orders through the second quarter of last year and we had some revenue realized in the second quarter from lax but we had a large procurement project that we finished up during the first half of last year which that we didnt have a repeattype project this first half of the year operator our next question comes from robert hoffman with princeton opportunity partners robert hoffman it seems especially for those of us who are on the east coast that the proliferation of transportation signs and its nice to see the vanguard label on all of these things and especially here in new jersey do you have any sense of  i get the impression that the highways that put them on start with x and then end up with x x over the period of a number of years do you have any sense of the market opportunity i mean are there big competitors that are taking share in other places or is it something that you see you have  to 0 years of pretty dramatic growth opportunity when you can see the results of what good signage does for traffic flow in other words can you give us any sense of longterm market opportunity in transportation reece a kurtenbach so in the traffic business theres especially the overtheroad signage that i think youre referencing in new jersey and some of the other states i believe as youre mentioning the core technology is seen as beneficial its expensive to build highways and putting in signage like we provide helps makes the usage of your existing highways more efficient so we see that thats a continuing part of a highway project going forward however the procurement progress  process is done through either a state or maybe a county or city level and there is a heavy influence of federal dollars that often greenlight these projects and its difficult to project from yeartoyear how the federal government will choose to lease or not certain funds which puts a difficulty in estimating future business in the transportation area robert hoffman how about internationally are you seeing the same sort of interest in international appearances reece a kurtenbach as i said before currently our focus in international is in these other segments and we havent  the selling cycle in transportation tends to be quite long as you need to work to get qualified by different governmental agencies and we havent taken that approach yet in our international business not to say that we havent done some transportation type of projects but not these large procurement type of projects for overtheroad signage robert hoffman but are there  are they being  so other people are out there doing those or is the international market indiscernible the us reece a kurtenbach yes there are definitely companies internationally that are participating in those markets and you will see similar types of displays if you travel the major cities and highways around the world operator and im not showing any further questions at this time id like to turn the conference back to our hosts for closing remarks sheila mae anderson i will answer morris question earlier about warranty as a percentage of sales for the first quarter we also were at about  for the first quarter of this fiscal year so weve trended that way throughout the whole first half reece a kurtenbach thank you sheila i think that concludes our comments we appreciate everybodys time and attention this morning and we hope you have a great thanksgiving holiday operator ladies and gentlemen
