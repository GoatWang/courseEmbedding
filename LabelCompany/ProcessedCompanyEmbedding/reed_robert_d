star in something else the new series was entitled the brady bunch and featured a widowed man with three children from a previous marriage marrying a widow also with three children from a previous marriage the shows creator sherwood schwartz said he was inspired to create the show after reading a news item in the los angeles times stating that more than  percent of all marriages included a child or children from a previous marriage schwartz thought the idea was  the key to a new and unusual tv series it was a revelation the first blended family his kids and her kids together although this situation had in fact been seen for years on the danny thomas show on which reed has appeared as a guest star in  reed was the producers second choice for the role of mike brady after gene

shakespearean training producers and directors found reed difficult to work with both on and off the set the cast however got along well with him in his efforts to bring more realism to the show reed often locked horns with the shows creator and executive producer schwartz reed regularly presented schwartz with handwritten memoranda detailing why a certain characters motivation did not make sense or why it was wrong to combine elements of farce and satire schwartz generally ignored reeds suggestions although in an attempt to alleviate tension reed was allowed to direct some episodes in a  interview reed admitted that he often butted heads with schwartz stating we fought over the scripts always over the scripts the producer sherwood schwartz had done gilligans islandjust gag lines that would have been what the brady bunch would have been if i hadnt protested reed and florence henderson in a publicity shot for the brady bunch  reed was particularly appalled by what would turn out to be the shows final episode the hairbrained scheme he sent schwartz a memo picking apart the episode but schwartz did not receive the memo promptly enough to change the show as reed wanted as a result reed refused to appear in the episode altogether though schwartz had decided to replace reed if the series were picked up for a sixth season the show ended up being cancelled shortly thereafter reed later indicated he took the role for financial reasons but tried to remain positive despite his creative differences with schwartz by reminding himself the series was primarily about the children reed masked his dissatisfaction in front of the camera always performing professionally without any indication of his unhappiness despite his discontent with the show reed genuinely liked his costars and was a father figure to the younger cast members costar susan olsen became friends with reeds daughter karen who made a guest appearance in the episode the slumber caper reeds final appearance in the

star in something else the new series was entitled the brady bunch and featured a widowed man with three children from a previous marriage marrying a widow also with three children from a previous marriage the shows creator sherwood schwartz said he was inspired to create the show after reading a news item in the los angeles times stating that more than  percent of all marriages included a child or children from a previous marriage schwartz thought the idea was  the key to a new and unusual tv series it was a revelation the first blended family his kids and her kids together although this situation had in fact been seen for years on the danny thomas show on which reed has appeared as a guest star in  reed was the producers second choice for the role of mike brady after gene

shakespearean training producers and directors found reed difficult to work with both on and off the set the cast however got along well with him in his efforts to bring more realism to the show reed often locked horns with the shows creator and executive producer schwartz reed regularly presented schwartz with handwritten memoranda detailing why a certain characters motivation did not make sense or why it was wrong to combine elements of farce and satire schwartz generally ignored reeds suggestions although in an attempt to alleviate tension reed was allowed to direct some episodes in a  interview reed admitted that he often butted heads with schwartz stating we fought over the scripts always over the scripts the producer sherwood schwartz had done gilligans islandjust gag lines that would have been what the brady bunch would have been if i hadnt protested reed and florence henderson in a publicity shot for the brady bunch  reed was particularly appalled by what would turn out to be the shows final episode the hairbrained scheme he sent schwartz a memo picking apart the episode but schwartz did not receive the memo promptly enough to change the show as reed wanted as a result reed refused to appear in the episode altogether though schwartz had decided to replace reed if the series were picked up for a sixth season the show ended up being cancelled shortly thereafter reed later indicated he took the role for financial reasons but tried to remain positive despite his creative differences with schwartz by reminding himself the series was primarily about the children reed masked his dissatisfaction in front of the camera always performing professionally without any indication of his unhappiness despite his discontent with the show reed genuinely liked his costars and was a father figure to the younger cast members costar susan olsen became friends with reeds daughter karen who made a guest appearance in the episode the slumber caper reeds final appearance in the

star in something else the new series was entitled the brady bunch and featured a widowed man with three children from a previous marriage marrying a widow also with three children from a previous marriage the shows creator sherwood schwartz said he was inspired to create the show after reading a news item in the los angeles times stating that more than  percent of all marriages included a

interview reed admitted that he often butted heads with schwartz stating we fought over the scripts always over the scripts the producer sherwood schwartz had done gilligans islandjust gag lines that would have been what the brady bunch would have been if i hadnt protested reed and florence henderson in a publicity shot for the brady bunch  reed was particularly appalled by what would turn out to be the shows final episode the hairbrained scheme he sent schwartz a memo picking apart the episode but schwartz did not receive the memo promptly enough to change the show as reed wanted as a result reed refused to appear in the episode altogether though schwartz had decided to replace reed if the series were picked up for a sixth season the show ended up being cancelled shortly thereafter reed later indicated he took the role for financial reasons but tried to remain positive despite his creative differences with schwartz by reminding himself the series was primarily about the children reed
