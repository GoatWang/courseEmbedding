enhancements for  expands services aimed at attracting wealthy retail investors dec     am by jed horowitz  zoom the charles schwab corp already having increased assets under custody for independent investment advisers this year is preparing several products services and technology offerings for advisers next year included in the mix are expanded trust capabilities online foreignstock trading and federal deposit insurance corpinsured sweep accounts for parking clients cash at multiple banks in discussing plans for  however schwab executives seem most excited about attracting wealthy individuals directly to the firms branches and investment products “we think that there are more and more individual investors out there looking for advice and were not overly convinced that they are going to pay  or  or  or even  — and maybe even  — for some of the advice that they expect to receive” chief executive walter w bettinger ii told analysts at a business update conference last month  zoom walter w bettinger ii we intend to be able to deliver highly scalable but extraordinarily professional and diversified advice “we intend to be able to deliver highly scalable but extraordinarily professional and diversified advice with the most sophisticated risk management techniques available to our clients at a very very sharp price point — an industryimpacting price point” that may raise more of a challenge for rival brokerages that target socalled massaffluent investors than for registered investment advisers who generally pursue the assets of even wealthier individuals and families but schwab executives made it clear that they are flexing their considerable marketing muscle to pursue such highnetworth investors as well according to a transcript of their remarks at the conference schwabs retail division next year will introduce a “bold new marketing campaign” aimed at selling “professional portfolio management” products an expanded inventory of fixedincome products and “additional advised offers enhanced over what we have today” to a range of investors and active traders said benjamin l brigeman executive vice president in charge of investor services as schwab designates its directretail unit asked if referrals to rias keeping assets under custody with schwab would be part of the advisory menu for highnetworth clients he didnt give a direct answer “we want to make sure that what we have is what the clients are looking for but also salable in a mass way” he said “a big part of the conversation” he added will revolve around using exchangetraded funds to manage wealthy peoples portfolios professionally schwab recently introduced its first proprietary etfs with no trading commissions for its clients and company founder charles r schwab told analysts at the business update conference to expect equally aggressive promotions in other areas including inbranch advice the company has a pilot program in place in three cities now to entice investors in for handholding and based on early results it will likely expand the program next year he said “we are going to become even more bold than you might think we are today” the former chief executive said independent advisers of course have always had mixed feelings about relying so much for custody trading services products and support on firms that have the potential to compete with their clients large custodians with big discount networks such as schwab fidelity investments and td ameritrade holding corp have tried to moderate such tensions with programs such as referrals of wealthy clients from branches to select rias with mixed results the strains continue as custodians reach out to convince brokers from fullservice firms to set up practices as independent rias sometimes in the backyards of existing clients they also however are encouraging some of the breakaway brokers to join the practices of existing rias advisers following schwabs multichannel efforts appear philosophical about its latest plans “in the modern world everybody is in everyone elses businesses in some way” said gene diederich chief executive of moneta group llc which has about  billion in its ria business “we are not really concerned about schwab being in our business because we dont get a lot of pushback on fees from clients who look for very highservice relationships but if they start pulling clients away from us it will be a different story” mr diederich who joined the firm this year after a long career at ag edwards  sons inc and its successor firm wachovia securities llc said that schwab and fidelity with which moneta keeps the bulk of its assets do “an excellent job of supporting us” the firm is trying to recruit brokers to its ria practice he said schwab executives for their part said they havent veered from their longtime strategy of uniting each of their businesses around the single purpose of serving individual investors whether indirectly through rias directly through retail branches and online trading or through corporate savings plans that can funnel participants to schwab when they retire james mccool executive vice president for schwabs institutionalservices division serving rias and corporate retirement plans told analysts at the business update meeting that advisers are pressing for help in winning their clients personaltrust accounts from banks “this will be the subject of continued investment” he said promising a progress report next spring a schwab spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the initiative relates to the companys plan to stop holding alternative assets for advisers some advisers requesting anonymity said theyve been told that schwab has applied for noaction relief on the custody issue from the securities and exchange commission mr mccool said that his unit is both expanding and keeping a rein on expenses by making “proper risk management decisions about what we can hold how we manage our clients assets knowing that they are expecting us to be that thirdparty independent custodian watching over the assets  this is whats allowing us to continue to make investments  whether its trust or the etf or other things across the firm” improving capabilities mr bettinger told analysts that in spite of a tough year in which trading volume and asset inflows from clients have decreased schwab is improving its web platforms and desktop trading capabilities across all channels for ria clients he singled out a plan for “a multibank sweep initiative which enables advisers to deliver to their endclients likely a higher yield than they can get today in a traditional sweep money market fund” schwab officials wouldnt comment on when the offering will be ready but said the firm has to make systems and other operational adjustments td ameritrade this month plans to double the fdicinsured capacity it offers on sweep accounts by adding a second bank affiliated with td bank financial group its largest stakeholder a spokeswoman said it began offering its first sweep vehicle in may as an alternative to rockbottom money market rates with a government guarantee other improvements that schwab plans for advisers and activetrading clients this year include the ability to trade foreign stocks online in dollars or other currencies — something that fidelity introduced this year — and additional fixedincome products the institutionalservices business run by mr mccool represented about  of schwabs revenue and  of its pretax profit margin in the first three quarters of  citing statistics from cerulli associates inc he said schwabs market share of ria assets is a little more than  double that of fidelity its closest competitor and added that the “spread” is increasing schwabs net asset flow from one of its two leading competitors in this years first three quarters was up  from the comparable period in  mr mccool said without naming the competitor new assets from various competitors breakaway brokers and current clients however are arriving in smaller client accounts than in recent years he said while schwab continues to expand its adviser services unit mr mccool — who joined the firm in  when it bought the k servicing business started by mr bettinger — said hes less interested in building market share at the expense of revenue in the retirement services field schwab wont bid for the business of plan sponsors and thirdparty administrators who want only plainvanilla administrative services he asserted “it may mean in the long run that were not going to keep showing a hockey stick with growth of new participants in the k business” he told analysts email jed horowitz at jhorowitzinvestmentnewscom  comments what do you think view comments
