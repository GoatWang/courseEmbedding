truenorthinvestment philosophyour team investment philosophy there’s no single concept is right for every investor – at truenorth our team works with you to develop a strategy that aligns with your objectives and risk profile our guiding principles are based upon our core beliefs regarding asset allocation risk management and securities selection asset allocation asset allocation is a key component of our portfolio management decisions unlike many other wealth managers it is an ongoing process at truenorth it begins with determining your strategic asset allocation – this simply means the longterm target for how your assets are divided between stocks bonds and cash your strategic allocation is based upon your risk profile and longterm return objectives it indicates how your investments would typically be allocated in what we would consider “normal” or neutral market conditions tactical asset allocation is ongoing and refers to adjustments we may make to your strategic asset allocation based upon our economic and market outlook for example if we think the markets pose excessive risks we may make a tactical adjustment to your allocation to reduce market exposure and increase cash we may also hold a limited amount of bonds in equity portfolios or stocks within fixed income portfolios in an effort to reduce risk or enhance returns risk management managing risk is integral to wealth creation and preservation our recommendations with respect to overall investment strategy and strategic asset allocation are based upon each client’s individual circumstances this means that our approach for clients with sufficient lifetime wealth will differ from strategies for those who need their nest egg to grow for the future it also means transitioning your portfolio to a different strategy as your needs change over time securities selection we select asset classes from the top down then pick stocks from the bottom up top down asset class selection involves analyzing the big picture we form our outlook for the economy and individual economic sectors and then use our economic forecast to pick the industries we believe represent the best opportunities for growth and outperformance bottom up stock selection is driven by indepth analysis of investment candidates within those favored industries both qualitative and quantitative securities analysis are used in our securities selection process quantitative analysis focuses on mathematical and statistical research such as the debttoequity and pricetoequity ratios qualitative analysis uses subjective judgment to evaluate information such as management expertise industry cycles labor relations and other factors not generally identified through quantitative analysis our securities selection process incorporates independent and sellside research with our own internal analysis resources include independent economic market sector and individual securities analysis and research subscription services that provide a wide range of sellside analysis of market sectors and individual securities our goal with respect to fixed income securities selection is to develop a portfolio that seeks to optimize income manage downside risk and provide some potential for portfolio appreciation   form advprivacy policydisclosure  7 truenorth inc   e nd st north suite  wichita ks   all rights reserved personal  truenorth inc
