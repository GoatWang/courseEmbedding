photo gary d cohn director of the white house national economic council as president trump met with automobile industry leaders at the white house on tuesday credit doug millsthe new york times goldman sachs has rewarded its departing president gary d cohn with expedited access to cash and stock payments valued at nearly  million and in doing so has tacitly encouraged another of its executives to accept an influential role in washingtonlate on tuesday mr cohn director of the national economic council advising president trump disclosed in a securities filing that he and his family members had received ownership that day of  shares of goldman stock — a position valued at nearly  million that award came in addition to a cash payout announced the same day amounting to about  million leaving him with a total windfall of about  milliongiven that mr cohn  is required to divest his goldman shares under federal ethics laws “we took these actions to enable him to comply with the conflict of interest rules just as we have done for people in the de blasio administration” said jake siewert a company spokesman referring to the office of mayor bill de blasio of new york under a standing policy mr siewert added goldman allows departing employees who are entering government service to keep their stockin recent weeks someone familiar with mr cohn’s financial plans said he made substantial donations to various charities in preparation for his new job and he is poised to sell at least some of his goldman shares he is drawing no salary for his work at the white house the person added advertisement continue reading the main story a white house spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for commentgoldman’s acceleration of its usual curbs on the eligibility of mr cohn’s stock for sale has revived a debate over whether veterans of the firm who enter public service receive special treatment from the firm — or whether the firm receives such treatment from former employees in government continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story some experts on government ethics said goldman’s treatment of mr cohn smacked of favoritism “they’re playing a game and they’re playing a game to make this person feel beholden to goldman sachs” said richard w painter a professor at the university of minnesota law school and the chief white house ethics lawyer during the george w bush administration mr painter was among lawyers who recently sued mr trump accusing him of violating the constitution by allowing his hotels and other business operations to accept payments from foreign governments mr trump called the suit meritless“if goldman sachs has a contractual right to keep the stock but they on a casebycase basis almost always let you keep the stock if you go into government service then that’s what’s called an extraordinary payment” mr painter addedif mr cohn’s exit pay is ultimately defined as an extraordinary payment — typically a payment of more than  that is in addition to the employer’s existing obligation and at a time when government employment appears possible — he could be barred from participating in matters

goldman in  and eventually became its no  executive was paid well for his  years of service which included traveling the world on client and regulatory matters serving on the company’s board and handling many of the firm’s daytoday management issuesa significant portion of the nearly one million goldman shares that he and his family now own were already eligible for sale but a substantial amount of stock mostly in the form of restricted shares would normally not have been available to be sold for up to three years according to tuesday’s regulatory filingsin addition goldman bought back mr cohn’s stakes in certain private equity funds and hedge funds managed by the firm according to one filing some of the purchases were made at discounted prices because of the difficulty of selling out of the positionsgoldman’s actions toward mr cohn are part of “a longstanding tradition of encouraging people to give back to their communities when they leave the firm” mr siewert said “and that’s an important part of the culture here”indeed morgan stanley citigroup and other financial firms have policies similar to goldman’s but some shareholders find the practice objectionablelast year an arm of the aflcio filed shareholder proposals at goldman and four other major publicly traded banks a sixth proposal was later withdrawn seeking to end the practice of hastening stock sales by employees departing for government service the proposals which have been defeated in previous years reflect the union group’s concerns that relaxing the vesting policies would encourage important employees to leave their jobs advertisement continue reading the main story “the point of equity compensation is to attract and retain executives” said brandon rees deputy director of the aflcio’s investment office “ultimately i think it’s in the best interest of companies that their compensation practices be seen as not compromising the objectivity of government officials” continue reading the main story

gary cohn is the wrong choice to head the fed john tamny monday july   while the very healthy growth of finance beyond the traditional banking and investment banking sectors has changed perceptions somewhat being named a partner at goldman sachs remains one of the most prestigious accomplishments on all of wall street it’s well known that a partnership at the world’s most prominent investment bank carries with it cachet that few career designations can match yet what’s less well known is how extraordinarily difficult it is to maintain one’s partner status at goldman after having been invited into this most meritocratic of clubs as a former very senior goldman investment banker once told me full disclosure i worked at goldman sachs from  to  and i only slightly paraphrase “once you’re named partner the clock starts ticking unless you achieve something really remarkable very quickly you’ll be kicked out” so while cohn’s accomplishments recommend him for all sorts of prominent jobs he remains the wrong choice for fed chair in short the hardest work for goldman partners arguably takes place after they’ve reached the proverbial mountaintop this is something for the federal reservefocused to keep in mind when thinking about former goldman  gary cohn’s desire to replace janet yellen as fed chairman cohn not only made partner at goldman he plainly thrived and he thrived for a very long time whatever one’s view of the fed goldman sachs or government in general what can’t be denied is that cohn is a remarkably talented person sorry but you just don’t last that long at gs and at such a high level unless you’re accomplishing things that very few can so while cohn’s accomplishments alone recommend him for all sorts of prominent jobs in a place where prominence often dies see cohn’s former gs colleague henry paulson’s washington dc stint he remains the wrong choice for fed chair importantly the view that cohn is the wrong choice has nothing to do with him expanding the central bank’s long overstated power the fed’s overstated power about it the fed’s greatest champions think that it can quite literally plan economic growth that it can dictate specific outcomes of the “money supply” and gdp variety and that its keen sense of the ridiculous notion of “full employment” allows it to control inflation what a laugh as the th century revealed in bright and tragically bloody colors central planning of any economic outcome is a horrific impossibility somehow fed cheerleaders and their reliably clueless enablers in the media have spared the central bank from the th century’s clear verdict about the  failure rate of control from the commanding heights that the us economy still booms is a reminder that the fed has the power to plan next to nothing thank goodness economic growth is the greatest enemy rising prices have ever known furthermore the accepted nonwisdom inside the fed that says economic growth causes inflation through product and labor shortages ignores the basic laws of economics to consume is to logically produce first so the notion that surging production authors shortages ignores how we’re able to consume in the first place these things balance and then as history and logic make abundantly clear economic growth is the greatest enemy rising prices have ever known that technological advances are by their very name investment advances that lead to more production in return for less human labor input thus lower prices that production in the us is a global endeavor think the globalized nature of the production of boeing and ford automobiles to name two is plainly lost on the fed’s narrow minds growth itself is what mitigates what is always and everywhere a mirage labor shortages except inside the minds of fed officials not only can it not plan or dictate economic outcomes its discredited models of how the world works indicate that it wouldn’t know what to do even if it could as for the fed’s greatest critics they needlessly flatter it never explained by those convinced that the fed is the source of nearly every economic ill in the world is how an entity which projects its influence through an antiquated us banking sector one that represents a small fraction of total domestic credit could have so much control over the most dynamic economy in the world one that largely operates free of the riskaverse credit offered up by banks dollar devaluations regarding the popular view among conspiracy theorists that the dollar’s  decline has been a creation of the feds machinations history mocks this claim lest we forget major dollar devaluations revealed their ugly head in the th century despite the fed being created in the th cohn indicated that a weak currency has a positive impact on the economy ok but it doesn’t as for the th it was fdr not the fed who foisted a devalued dollar on an already limping us economy in  it was richard nixon and his treasury department not the fed who chose to delink the dollar from gold in  thus setting in motion a decade of economic malaise that is always the result of devaluation notable here is that fed chairman eugene meyer resigned over fdr’s mistake while arthur burns begged nixon to not commit his there’s nothing to the fed’s long association with the dollar’s exchange rate despite the overdone claims of the fed’s greatest critics they plainly don’t know why they should despise it still the dollar paradoxically looms as a reason for president trump to not appoint cohn it does because of the perceptions it will create about the administration’s stance on the matter while the dollar’s exchange rate is plainly not part of the fed’s portfolio that’s why fed officials almost as a rule don’t comment on it it’s been reported by prominent sources that when he initially met with presidentelect trump ahead of the transition cohn indicated that a weak currency has a positive impact on the economy ok but it doesn’t the economy is not a blob it’s just people people earn dollars and their economic chances are not enhanced when what they earn is being robbed of its value if trump embraces the discredited fdr nixon carter bush  policies in favor of a weak currency his economic program will fail furthermore the trump administration has singled out jobs and opportunity as its major economic focus this speaks loudly to how crippling a policy in favor of a weak dollar would be there are quite simply no companies and no jobs without investment first and when investors commit capital they’re buying dollars in the future a policy of dollar devaluation would run counter to the very investment necessary for the businesses and jobs that the administration would like to have materialize applied to cohn while the dollar is once again not part of the fed’s portfolio his appointment to the central bank’s top spot would likely signal to markets that the administration shares cohn’s view that a weak dollar is in the best interests of the us and worse that it’s the administration’s policy to be blunt if trump embraces the discredited fdr nixon carter bush  policies in favor of a weak currency his economic program will fail the wrong choice the trump economy will similarly be neutered if the administration like the bush  administration approaches the crucial message of the markets in situational fashion getting right to the point if we love wall street we should love it enough to let the insolvent fail just as silicon valley would be a tiny fraction of its prosperous self if its weakest startups  fail were constantly being propped up with taxpayer dollars so is the financial system needlessly weakened and with it the us economy overall when its insolvent institutions are having their errors cushioned with the money of others here again perception matters cohn’s past disqualifies him despite his immense success at gs whatever cohn’s view of financial bailouts during what is now a period of relative calm it’s fair to say that his past could cloud his judgement if goldman once again finds itself in serious trouble as it did in  on the above matter the bailouts that needlessly caused a crisis in  make cohn the wrong choice for fed chair when we remember how much the fed influenced the bush administration’s wrongheaded decision to pursue bailouts back then in that case cohn’s past disqualifies him despite his immense success at gs lest we forget paulson was a rather fierce critic of bailouts until he wasn’t cohn is a risk for the same reason paulson turned out to be he might find a reason to save what shouldn’t be saved sorry but business failure is a sign of progress and this includes banks and investment banks even goldman sachs  after that the politics or optics of appointing a former gs  to the fed’s top spot make the notion of doing so a nonstarter and while cohn has made the correct point that the fed is but one entity in a world of credit “they’re constrained by the rest of the world” arguably the biggest disqualifier beyond the bad politics of his appointment concerns his very own politicking for the job th century political economist walter bagehot once observed that central banking positions are desired by “vain grasping men” and sure enough cohn is angling for the job he wants to “accomplish things” while at the fed and that’s very dangerous so did ben bernanke though a longtime keynesian with views that were plainly of the leftwing variety bernanke sensing a chance to be appointed fed chair became a “republican” overnight suddenly courting prominent members of the right inside and outside washington dc bernanke was plainly attracted to the prestige of being fed chairman and his lust for relevance caused him to “do something” more than once while in control we all know how his tenure turned out that cohn wants the job of fed chairman is the surest sign that he like bernanke wants to “accomplish things” while at the fed and that’s very dangerous while the fed’s relevance on a day to day basis is way overplayed its role in the  bailouts reminds us that on the odd days the fed is capable of creating major damage that cohn plainly lusts for the job is a sign that he believes the fed has expansive powers that need to be utilized for that alone gary cohn is the wrong choice for fed chairman reprinted from forbes john tamny john
