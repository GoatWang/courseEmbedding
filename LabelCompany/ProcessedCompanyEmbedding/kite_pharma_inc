system’s ability to detect and kill cancer cells however the immune system is unable to kill cancer cells when tumorspecific t cells are deficient in number are unable to function properly or fail to

tcr depending on the type of cancer our dual platform has the potential to address both hematological and solid tumor cancers the science of car t play car video chimeric antigen receptor car cars are engineered proteins composed of two distinct functional components the first consists of an antibody fragment or target binding domain that allows cars to recognize targets that are present on the surface of cancer cells the second provides signals that rapidly and powerfully activate the t cell to attack and kill cancer cells we are developing multiple car product candidates including ktec while continuing to innovate the next generation of carengineered t cells to achieve even greater results the science of car t play tcr video t cell receptor tcr tcrs are proteins that allow t cells to identify cancer targets presented on the surface of cancer cells or inside cancer cells endogenous tcrs that are specific to a cancer can be isolated and then engineered into a large number of t cells that recognize and attack various types of solid and hematologic cancers kite in collaboration with its partners is currently advancing several tcrengineered t cell programs that target
