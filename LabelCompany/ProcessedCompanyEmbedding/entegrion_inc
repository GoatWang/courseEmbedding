opportunities client login products stasix® resusix™ portable coagulation monitor pcm search search for stasix® when bleeding is caused by low platelet counts or platelet dysfunction the medical team needs immediate access to platelets that provide predictable consistent function stasix® is a pharmaceutical agent derived from human platelets that provides more consistent cellular hemostatic function than liquidstored banked platelets the stabilization steps used in processing stasix® also provide pathogen reduction and the freezedrying enables truly longterm storage with greater ease of use and availability than banked technologies the hemostatic agent in preclinical development by entegrion overcomes the storage limitations of fresh platelets because it is freezedried for shelfstable storage when needed for use in a patient the sterile agent can be rapidly and conveniently rehydrated and infused while currently in development stasix® will serve many markets once it is commercialized as a hemostatic agent stasix® can provide targeted hemostasis to areas of noncompressible bleeding in addition stasix® has a projected shelf life of  years which exceeds storage for liquid banked platelets that currently expire after  weeks this extended shelf life can provide a hospital with a logistical advantage to the current standard of care saving both time and resources in today’s constrained health care systems a key platform technology—stasix® is one of the technologies in the hemostatic patch under development by entegrion also the particles in stasix® can be loaded with imaging and highly cytotoxic materials for targeted delivery to areas of vascular injury this capability allows stasix® to be activated for specific tasks with extensive possibilities from diagnostics to therapeutic treatment   our goal is to offer a preferred alternative to liquidstored banked platelets with improved bacterial safety antigenicity and reliable function  entegrion inc
