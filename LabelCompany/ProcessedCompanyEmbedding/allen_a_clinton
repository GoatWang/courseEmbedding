corner of fifth avenue and second street where the firm was long in business they were greeting old friends and patrons however in a brand new building the most modern structure of its kind in the city removal of the stock from the temporary quarters in the howes block occupied while the new building was under construction was completed through night work wednesday in fact the removal process has been under way for days and days and nights and nights not all of the fixtures have been transferred but they will be in the course of a few days everything in the new store is in as shipshape as possible enough so that it is possible to transact business but the formal opening will not take place until later when everything has been put in its place and the store is in the spick and span condition that it is the intention to maintain admire new building many old friends called thursday to admire the handsome new home of the dry goods firm the erection of the modern fourstory building has been under way for fifteen months ground being broken in may  for months prior to that however the work of dismantling the old building had been in progress unseasonable weather conditions greatly delayed the work but the firm now has a building of which it is justifiably proud it is of steel construction entirely fireproof with the latest pattern elevators the fixtures are clintonmade in fact so far as possible the building throughout is a “made in clinton” structure owing to the fact that the steel is heavier than usual in building on account of the large storerooms on each floor without intervening walls the construction was necessarily slow only one life was lost in its erection an unusual record remodel howes block even before the firm had removed from its quarters in the howes block the remodeling of that building was under way the basement first and second floors are to be entirely remodeled there will be storerooms in the basement and on the first floor and office suites and quarters for a business college on the second floor owing to the illness of exmayor e m howes it was impossible to secure definite plans for the work the basement however will afford quarters for

other things that make it a place of enchantment for the shopping public like an aladdin’s fairy place the wonderful four story building rears itself from the corner once occupied by one of clinton’s oldest and least modern buildings had not clinton people themselves witnessed the change marking with interest the progress it would hardly seem possible that only seventeen months ago the work of razing the old building was begun may   marking the beginning of that work during may and june the cleaning away of the building was in progress and contractor dan haring then began the erection of the new structure which was occupied july   although not ready for the formal opening until now and had it not been that fate intervened the building would have long since been completed it was september  before the steel arrived and well remembered are the difficulties experienced in the excavations when rain many times threatened to effectually stop the work for long periods how electric pumps were worked and every effort made to hurry the work but despite the delays and the hamperings by man and nature the building now stands a monument to its owners and builders one of the modern structures in the city furthermore it is a clinton made product practically throughout even to the fixtures is complete store to become thoroughly acquainted with the store in all its little details to know just why the air is so pure the lighting so good the fire protection so complete the service so prompt and courteous the delivery system so pleasing etc is a full day’s job and it would be a pleasing one at that but the store’s patrons have no necessity for paying attention to details they are all worked out by machinery and employees and system for the patrons it is sufficient to know that all of those accommodations and more are at their fingers’ tips when they enter the store there is system on every hand working so smoothly that no one can realize that it is the answer to the

the building history of firm how the “house of van allen’s” came into being this is how the “house of van allen’s” came into existence john d van allen senior member of the firm was born in mchenry county illinois in the little village of crystal lake some forty years ago then a mere boy he started out to fight the battles of the world his first job brought him  per week and he put in his spare moments at night school to fit himself for positions still higher and if the truth were known he was early in life a familiar figure at the savings bank window his career was not of the mushroom or chance variety he was determined to learn the trade of merchandising with a t stewart  co then the largest dry goods store in the united states as the result of hard work and application to his duties he gained raped promotion he was not built to be cringing or supplicating but was straight forward and independent with his employer then as he is with business associates today and he has a good backing for his spirit of independence he produces the goods it has often been said that all customers look alike to john d van allen and that he plays no favorites the smallest tot can do as well at his store as its mother and the servant girl is accorded the same courtesy and fair dealing as her employer the wife of the millionaire takes her turn with the wife of the man in her husband’s employ while the dollar of one buys no more than the dollar of the other this independence is attributed to his makeup he was born that way just as some men are born homely or good looking step by step he advanced until he became traveling salesman one of the youngest on the road in  he came to this city with his wife and two children looking for a location to settle down and make a home he bought into a small dry goods store with mr abbott the firm becoming van allen  abbott located in fifth avenue with a floor space of about  square feet afterward mr van allen bought out his partner and in  sold an interest to fred rixon annexing another room with an entrance from second street the firm then became van allen and rixon  to  fifth avenue with a floor space of  additional square feet later mr van allen desired to spread out so he bought out his partner and added a room of  square feet making a total of  square feet occupied by the store which was then operated under the name of john d van allen nine years ago mr van allen’s son fred h van allen became a member of the firm and a few years ago the building occupied by the store was purchased later razed and the splendid new building erected during all of his father’s merchandising and expending in clinton fred h van allen had been going through school and college to prepare for his career after the completion of his college term he spent a year with marshall field  co in chicago and had two years experience with one of the largest houses in new york so he was well equipped to take up the duties of a member of the firm when on february   the firm became john d van allen  son ten thousand at store’s opening the clinton herald october   p  estimated that number attended reception for public wednesday see fine stock building

on the counters and otherwise displayed while the various departments fairly shown with the brilliancy of their offerings the building was and lighted throughout and people were thoroughly acquainted with its facilities the firm was the recipient of congratulations by the thousands from patrons friends and business associates one of the pleasing features of the day was the presentation of a huge bouquet of roses from the employees clinton has its own architectural wonder the clinton herald january   p even though not a new york or chicago downtown clinton is another location for the architecturallyminded actually the exact location is on the corner of th ave s and nd st now known as petersen’s but originally the van allen department store the story behind the creation of clinton’s architecturally unique building is currently featured in the january issue of “the art institute of chicago” magazine the story began in  with the firm of john d van allen and son well established in the dry goods business in clinton decided to expand their selling power with the construction of a  store the project became a reality as correspondence between the van allen firm and famed architect louis h sullivan of chicago began in october  sullivan was noted for his then avantgarde designs a radical departure from the baroque of victorian days but problems arose as the proposed drawings drifted into the  price range plus continuous revisions in exterior and interior construction layouts cost of the building was whittled down to  plus  for architect’s fee and steel and concrete construction was abandoned and the “slowburning” system was substituted floor joists were supported by steel columns and girders while the columns girders and ceilings were plastered on wire cloth for fire protection the layouts were revised and refined from may through october of  until the van allen company selected a local man daniel haring as builder construction started in february of  when test pits were sunk and thus uncovered another problem – a bed of quicksand – which called for revision of the building’s foundation plans the dry goods building consisting of four floors with attic and basement was completed in  the finished product had the exterior façade features of decorative terra cotta ornaments with slender mullions extending from the second floor window to the attic ending with an outburst of foliage the large show windows are accented with vertical sections of black marble which extend upward to the horizontal decorative band below the second floor a broad strip of black marble surrounds the base of the second floor below the first brick course while the upper three story windows are framed in terra cotta letters of correspondence between the van allen family and sullivan were recently donated to the burnham library of architecture by john b van allen grandson of the store’s founder         van allen building a landmark the clinton herald saturday january   p  by tom alex herald staff writer – the petersen harned von maur building originally the van allen department store will become clinton’s first national historic landmark the building will be listed on the national register of historic places sources said that means the structure designed by louis henry sullivan  –  is of national significance and will take its place in the history of our nation the announcement is expected to be made officially within a week sullivan was one of america’s great advocates of modern architectural style an outspoken critic of the imitation of historic styles which dominated architecture in the later ’s and early ’s the van allen building was his th building according to hugh morrison author of “louis sullivan prophet of modern architecture” he designed  buildings in his lifetime two structures completed prior to the clinton project were the people’s savings bank in cedar rapids and st paul’s methodist church also in cedar rapids the two which followed his work in clinton were the henry c adams building in algona and the merchant’s national bank in grinnell the bank in grinnell now called the poweshiek national bank also will be declared a national historic landmark one of the buildings in cedar rapids also was under consideration however sources said the building there apparently had undergone too many changes since its original construction sullivan also is remembered for being the employer of another famed architect frank lloyd wright was his pupil sullivan’s theory of functionalism which brought out the first skyscraper concepts was not widely accepted during his lifetime according to publications about his career he had few commissions during his twilight years but during those years sullivan designed at least five of his last projects in the state of iowa many of his creations were designed in partnership with dankmar adler some of which include the auditorium in chicago skyscrapers in chicago st louis and buffalo in them he brought out a style which he said represented modern functional needs like his masterpiece – the carson pirie scott store in chicago sullivan’s partnership with adler ended in  the firm of john d van allen and son in clinton was well established in the dry goods business in  when the owners decided to extend the firm’s selling power with the construction of a  store it was in that year that correspondence between the firm and the famed architect began but the proposals hit a snag when cost figures drifted into the  price range there were continuous revisions in exterior and interior construction layouts in  the van allen building was begun the cost was whittled down to  plus  for architect’s fee steel and concrete was abandoned for a mill construction or “slow burning system” of heavy wooden timbers the floor joists were supported by steel columns and girders while the columns girders and ceilings were plastered on wire cloth for fire protection following revisions and refinements from may through october  the firm chose a local man daniel haring as the builder construction was not long begun when one of the first problems surfaced in the form of a sandwater or “quicksand” bed it was discovered when test pits were sunk at the th avenue south and nd street location four floors with attic and basement were completed in  the finished product had the exterior façade feature s of decorative terra cotta ornaments with slender mullions extending from the second floor window to the attic ending with an outburst of foliage large show windows were accented with sections of black marble extending upward to the horizontal decorative band below the second floor a broad strip of black marble surrounded the base of the second floor and the upper three story windows were framed in terra cotta petersen harned von maur inc davenport announced its purchase of the van allen store on jan   sources said it normally takes a coordinated effort to establish a national historic landmark this was not the case in clinton representatives from washington d c sought out the two landmarks which are to be named to the national register of historic places they said this puts the van allen building “in the same ballpark with the old capitol building in iowa city” architect has mission to save van allen building the clinton herald thursday october   lynne darr herald staff writer – crombie taylor a noted architect and architectural historian from california is a man with a mission that mission is to save the van allen building designed by world famous architect louis sullivan if taylor’s mission is successful all of clinton will benefit the loss of a major department store in the old van allen building was sad news indeed sadder still has been the building considered one of sullivan’s greatest works sitting empty for the past year and a half in downtown clinton questions in the community have ranged from “what will become of it” and “who will buy or rent all those floors particularly when the trend is to shopping malls” to “is it a white elephant that’s outlived its usefulness” white elephant indeed taylor internationallyknown in his field recently moved to clinton and said the building is a “treasure” and one of america’s great pieces of architecture it is his hope to save the building it is his dream and his intent for the van allen building to house the permanent exhibition of the works of louis h sullivan it is also his intent to create a facility that would showcase and promote the cultural arts including exhibits dance the performing arts creative activities and writers’ workshops a facility according to taylor that will draw people from all over the country “people who will come and spend money the community however must be ready for them” he said taylor a retired professor in the department of architecture at the university of southern california and among other noteworthy accomplishments is also a former director of the institute of design in chicago he has for most of his professional life been a devoted fan of sullivan’s almost  years ago taylor traveled to cedar rapids to photograph the sullivan bank “it was in disgraceful condition” he said “it had been remodeled terribly it was very very shoddy with formica counters they had torn out the white marble” it was then taylor said he decided to travel to clinton to see what sullivan’s van allen building looked like he liked what he saw it hadn’t been remodeled yet and the old oak counters were still there “it is one of sullivan’s most completely untouched buildings” he said “it’s a masterpiece and is one of his last” as the years went by taylor and his wife hope continued to maintain homes in california chicago and in england and he remained devoted to sullivan’s designs some of taylor’s work throughout those years involved the restoration of the ballroom in the auditorium building in chicago another great work of sullivan’s aided by worldfamous architect frank lloyd wright “i’d been out of the country” taylor said “and it wasn’t until last spring that i heard sullivan’s clinton building was for sale with the potential of it being threatened or mistreated by a new possibly unsympathetic occupant i was very concerned and i came to clinton” since that time the architect has been busy very very busy because of decades of association with worldfamous architects taylor knows the enormous interest and following that sullivandesigned buildings have he also has spent years working with various foundations that underwrite the cost of architectural restorations that combination makes taylor a knowledgeable man indeed and a man with a mission in clinton iowa “a foundation needed to be established” he said “the van allen foundation has a nice ring it” he added with a twinkle in his eye according to taylor a foundation allows for not only the initial purchase price but for the cost of fund raising restoration and the obvious ongoing expense of staff maintenance and operation “substantial sums of money need to be raised to guarantee the continuity of the activities” he added the money is not easily come by and takes “everybody’s shoulder behind it but any group that doesn’t set its goals high enough and raise enough money at the beginning is doomed to falter and eventually fail’ he said taylor who is committed to the monumental project showed his commitment in a very “real” way several months ago when he purchased the stately home of the late george curtis grandson of one of the early business magnates in clinton taylor is presently in the process of restoring the large home to its  elegance he is anxiously awaiting the arrival of his furniture from both england and california “this is all still in the planning stages” taylor explained regarding his plans for the van allen building “there are a series of stages and it all takes time it takes years to develop but it doesn’t ever start without encouragement” taylor has established a temporary organization the ‘richard nickel committee” named after an admirer and photographer of sullivan buildings and is testing the waters of fundraising across the country for a project the committee has signed a oneyear option to buy the van allen building while the various aspects of the project are developed taylor who has spent many hours photographing buildings in clinton talking with city officials and of course the van allen family feels the community has much to offer but has much to do to prepare for an attraction of the nature of the cultural center and museum “we must not only save the van allen building” he said “we must save clinton and i do mean save not one more fine old building must be torn down i wish the city would not allow any new commercial construction until the existing buildings in the downtown area are restored and occupied” taylor mentioned the post office as a case in point “that’s a magnificent building it was painful to hear that plans are in place to replace it it should be retained with expansion at the present site it’s distressing to hear the post office would even contemplate leaving it i’m surprised the citizens will permit it” taylor said his concern is that once the post office moves from its present location the building will ultimately be demolished it’s a beautiful classic style building but it would not be economically feasible for anyone else to occupy it” taylor also mentioned the old railroad station “what a delightful building” he said “what a great city hall that would have made and how much money could have been saved” he also mentioned the old burpee building as one with great potential and added that clinton’s “architecture and charm must be retained” a cultural center like taylor hopes will become a reality in the van allen building “gives an image of culture to this community it’s that image you want to send to potential business and industry that may be thinking of relocation the development of culture is critical for a city’s economic development” “but oh my” taylor said “there’s so much to be done but we’ve begun haven’t we” building a masterpiece – the construction of the van allen the clinton herald october   the process of translating the van allen store into an actual building was the responsibility of clinton contractor daniel haring a native of pennsylvania who had established a construction firm in clinton at the turn of the century initially specializing in the construction of residential porches haring’s business rapidly expanded to the point where his firm was involved in the construction of many of clinton’s largest and finest buildings among the substantial buildings erected by haring’s firm were the wilson building the presbyterian church the ymca the former first national bank and the ankeny building in taking the contract to build the van allen store daniel haring became one of the principal figures in the exacting task of creating a masterpiece working under the watchful supervision of louis sullivan as well as that of jon and frederick van allen haring was responsible for coordinating the diverse trades and materials needed to construct the building the precision of sullivan’s design combined with daytoday problems encountered onsite made haring’s task a challenging one haring’s contract began with the demolition on the site which was formerly occupied by the van allen firm with the debris cleared away work was started on digging the basement and foundations the project posed several problems to the contractor who brought about unique solutions first was the presence of quicksand in the southwest corner which brought sullivan to the worksite to supervise construction of a floating raft of creosoted railroad ties upon which the concrete foundation would be poured another problem brought about by the presence of the mississippi river was the preparation and pouring of the concrete footings for the eight columns the contractor quickly learned that the footings would have to be dug and poured in one day to prevent water from seeping back into the space work would begin at  am and continue until  pm in order to hand dig the base and pass the dirt by bucket brigade while a worker handpumped the water from the site next the forms would be prepared and the concrete poured because of the hours involved in completing each column haring had an evening meal brought to the site for his workers reportedly louis sullivan himself supervised this difficult foundation work chainsmoking cigarettes while seated on an available nail keg many aspects of the building’s construction required precision assembly of materials in a manner similar to erecting a giant puzzle each piece of steel provided by the clinton bridge and iron works for the supporting frame was marked with an identifying code that corresponded to a detailed drawing showing the exact location for the installation of each piece similarly each individual piece of ornamental terra cotta on the façade was marked with a number corresponding to an installation diagram which had to be carefully followed by the masons the terra cotta itself was manufactured in crystal lake ill and shipped to clinton in box cars carefully packed in hay to prevent chipping and damage after the completion of the van allen store in september  haring’s construction firm continued to operate under family management the firm dissolved in  upon the retirement of daniel haring’s grandson richard nason during the recent restoration of the van allen building nason provided valuable family recollections and materials which have assisted in the renovation process continuing the presence of the haring family in the creation and perpetuation of this important structure van allen restoration started years ago the clinton herald thursday may   p a grand opening of historic building is  to  pm friday by scott t holland herald staff writer clinton – though the history of the van allen building reaches to its construction in  the story of its redevelopment began nearly  years ago following some two years of vacancy petersen harned a retail chain operating von maur stores pulled out of downtown clinton and vacated the van allen building on may   the doors were locked several months before oct   when the clinton herald ran a story titled “architect has mission to save van allen building” and pictured architectural historian crombie taylor who hoped to revive the building as a testament to and showcase for the works of  its creator american architect louis h sullivan “it is also his intent to create a facility that would showcase and promote the cultural arts” the story said “including exhibits dance the performing arts creative activities and writers’ workshops” taylor estimated some  people would travel to clinton annually if the van allen building could serve as the hub of a historic downtown with much more to offer than nearby galena ill in  riverboat gambling in clinton was still three years away and there was talk of amtrak service to the gateway area america was less than a month away from electing the first president bush the van allen foundation initially headed by taylor took out a oneyear option to buy the building from the van allen trust interior demolition work began with the goal of stripped away much of the interior largely to prevent a devastating fire “i’m amazed the city allowed this to stand empty with all the partitions” taylor said “it’s really a hazard it could have gone up like that i was surprised there isn’t a building code” taylor spoke to area historical groups and a small louis sullivan museum was erected in the first floor of the building by june of  at that time a small group of architects planned to purchase the building and preserve it as a testament to american architectural history viewing it in the same vein as andy warhol paintings then selling for millions of dollars on april   ann moran and edward howes were named cochairs of the steering committee “charged with raising between  and  for the restoration project by july  the money was needed to purchase the building before july  the day the foundation’s option to purchase twice extended would officially expire the group asked the city to buy the building for  and then lease it to the foundation a  grant had already been received from the state historical society at the time with gambling regulations passed by the state legislature and the city looking for other tourism options taylor outlined a floorbyfloor plan for the future of the building the basement would be used for a logging exhibit geared towards educating all ages on clinton’s historical involvement with lumber mills the first floor would hold an upscale cafe as well as a gift and book store the second floor would contain museum like exhibits dedicated to sullivan exhibits would also reach the third floor but those would focus on sciences and humanities mostly on a rotating basis the fourth floor known for its impressive view of the mississippi river would seat up to  people for banquets receptions concerts lectures and even ballet though the structure itself was for sale for only  some experts valued the building’s terra cotta ornamentation at  van allen trust members had indicated the ornamentation would be sold and the building demolished if the july  deadline was not met a week before the council was to hold a public hearing on the  question a clinton herald straw poll revealed several downtown merchants and shoppers in favor of the civic center plan as well as one employee of kline’s department store who thought the building should be razed for a parking lot an unidentified individual unknowingly predicting the future said the building should be converted to “penthouses” on may   the council voted unanimously to purchase the building half the money came from clinton business development program moneys the other half from a parking reserve fund current city councilman darrell smith serving then on the council before his election to mayor said the purchase of the building was against his philosophy but he could not let such an opportunity pass the city by the purchase by the city put the burden of restoration and maintenance costs back on the van allen foundation the day after the vote gov terry branstad spoke to republican supporters at the building and congratulated the council for its actions in midjune of  almost  had been secured including the  from the city the  state grant and  raised privately the clinton county board of supervisors added  to the pot on june  on july  an emotional flagraising ceremony heralded a new beginning for the van allen building the foundation soon began “selling” each of the building’s  square feet in by inch chunks for  supporters would be given a certificate of honorary ownership in the historic structure fundraising efforts culminated near the end of august when a  contribution from champion dairypak put the total donations in excess of  with money received and reconstruction ongoing the building was open for various events including frequent visits from prominent architects offering discourses on the history of the building taylor was hospitalized and underwent triplebypass surgery in california however he was part of the dedication ceremonies in oct   when the building was officially reopened as a civic center and museum the ceremonies replete with all the pomp and ceremony expected of such an occasion at the festivities mayor elizabeth snyder said “today marks an occasion unparalleled in clinton’s history it is an occasion for celebrating for looking back with satisfaction and pride and for looking forward with hope and faith in the future” in november the foundation obtained a  grant from the roy j carver charitable trust of muscatine to establish a summer internship program in architectural conservation nearing  the foundation received a major blow when taylor suddenly resigned his post “citing a vast difference in philosophy” according to the herald taylor said “the board had indicated a lack of confidence in his judgment on several matters and that certain restrictions were being placed on him” within weeks reports indicated an amicable agreement had been reached between taylor and the foundation board in november of  he was honored by the american association for state and local history for his work on the building at the time it was noted that more than  people had visited the van allen since the rededication  months prior many attending the  events held in the time frame eventually taylor announced that he and his wife hope would be leaving clinton on jan   slowed by his heart bypass operations and a cancer diagnosis the couple moved to charlottesville va taylor left with good feelings giving a public vote of confidence to coexecutive director bob soesbe currently an atlarge member of clinton’s city council in march  indra brewer was named coexecutive director an elevation from the administrative secretary and executive assistant posts she had held since january  on sept   a herald headline read “needed white knight’ to pull town out of dark” it led to a story detailing the report of a north carolina consultant joseph golden who offered the following dictum on the van allen building’s role in a declining downtown area “it has to be centrifugal it must sweep outward to a wide and diverse audience does it fill the genuine needs of the larger community rather than special interests if it can’t provide a useful service – don’t do the damn project” golden said there was an acceptance of defeat in clinton an acknowledgement of loss of control and a lack of caring a story written in the same edition detailed the resignation of volunteer coordinator sheryl villa echoing remarks made by crombie taylor in  villa said working conditions and agreements associated with her role were left unfulfilled towards the end of the decade potential suitors for the building were sought in november  the city adopted a plan to sell the van allen for  also pledging  for parking and a limited tax abatement for  years heartland properties a division of alliant energy was the principal investor at the time the company brought in community housing initiatives to develop the building into firstfloor retail space and  apartments renovation costs over the past four years have been pegged at  million the descendants of john d van allen have been on private tours of the building an opportunity also afforded to gov tom vilsack the work of the last three and a half years will come to fruition with friday’s open house which will be presented with less panache than the  festivities crombie taylor died may   in his california home due to congestive heart failure months before the first plan to “save” the van allen building a second time came to the surface but it is common conjecture that the recent project would not have seen the light of day had taylor not given such effort to preserve the building  years ago van allen building article from clinton herald  the following story was written for a  special section celebrating the rebirth of the van allen building the first of three prominent downtown clinton buildings redeveloped by community housing initiatives of spencer by scott t holland associate editor it has been called the most important historical building in iowa and through no small amount of effort the van allen building soon will be reborn in downtown clinton the building has been many things since its construction which lasted from  to  technically known as the sullivan building so named for its famous architect louis b sullivan its common name refers to the tenants for which it was built the van allen and son department store located at the corner of fifth avenue south and second street the fourstory structure housed van allen and son for more than half a century before it was leased in  to von maur it was those  years as the area’s largest retail facility that the building became known in and around iowa but in truth the store inside the building has never been as historically important as the building itself sullivan is renowned as a leader of american architecture he taught frank lloyd wright the country’s best known building designer the van allen building is unique for two reasons one is that of all the buildings sullivan designed several of which were banks it is the one built most closely to its original plans secondly some  letters between sullivan and john d van allen have been saved offering an insight into the minds of two men working together to create a lasting piece of american history a good deal is known about van allen himself including his  arrival in clinton to acquire a partnership in an existing dry goods store occupying  square feet on the future site of the historic building the threestory building in which van allen had eventually occupied  square feet had to be demolished to make way for sullivan’s creation which was built from  to  construction was headed by daniel haring a pennsylvania man whose other clinton works include the wilson and ankeny buildings first presbyterian church and the clinton family ymca in late  rescuing the building became the key project of architectural historian crombie taylor a longtime sullivan admirer though the building reopened in late  as a museum and cultural center its permanent future was not permanently cemented until the recent past the city interested in preserving the building for its historical value had acquired the building in  an agreement was reached between the city heartland properties and nonprofit developer community housing initiatives to overhaul the building the first floor would be given to retail space eventually determined to be the new home of wagner pharmacy a fixture in the downtown clinton scene the remaining floors would become apartments furnished with furniture and appliances from other clinton businesses that vision is soon to become a reality wagner is soon to open doubling the space of its present location and many of the  apartments are rented chi’s experience with the city has been so positive it is looking for another clinton project to give the same treatment the building also will contain a small museum dedicated to the history of the building and its famous architect now nearly  years after the building was conceived it stands as a testament to a community devoted to remembering its past and planning for its future        nettie mae lucas  iagenweb

google email july   am et heard on weekend edition sunday this past week at the democratic national convention in philadelphia nprs rachel martin spoke with retired marine corps general john allen who offered his passionate support of hillary clinton elise hu host this past week retired marine corps general john allen gave a passionate speech in support of hillary clinton at the democratic national convention nprs rachel martin spoke with the general who was commander of nato forces in afghanistan and most recently special presidential envoy for the global coalition to counter the islamic state rachel martin byline general thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us john allen great to be with you today martin you have spent a lifetime in the military being apolitical thats what being in the military is all about allen thats right  exactly right martin what has compelled you to say in this moment that hillary clinton should be the next commanderinchief allen you know this world is full of challenges right now and in and of itself i believe in her you know the united states is that transformational power in the world today but it doesnt do it on its own it does it through the mechanism of alliances and relationships and she gets that she understands that she wants to reinforce that and language that would seem to diminish the importance of nato or to pull out some of the fundamental tenets of what nato is article   an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us martin which donald trump has suggested allen yes i mean martin at least reevaluating those alliances allen that kind of rhetoric erodes the relationships inside nato it erodes its credibility she just gets this she understands it thats why i came out because this was a moment where the choices are very stark and supporting her at this moment to be the president of the united states seemed to me to be frankly my duty martin during the republican national convention in cleveland i mean there was an overwhelming sense of doom the message was the world is violent and dangerous donald trump is the guy to steer america through that do you understand the sense from people who support donald trump that it is a scary world when you look at how isis in particular has metastasized and the threats seem to just be popping up all over  do you get that fear on the other side do you understand it allen well of course i do the challenges we face today from isil from russia from china from iran from north korea  i dont want to add to peoples fears here  those are real and immediate concerns for the united states of america but were going  only be able to handle these in relationship to our partners  you know the strength of nato the strength of our relationships in east asia the strengths of our relationships with our arab partners in the gulf reinforcing the global coalition to counter isil all of those things require leadership and all of those things in the end give us some capacity to resolve or at least to meet these challenges martin president obama in his address said that hillary clinton can finish the job those were his words when talking about the threat from isis but how i mean what would she do that would be so different than what his administration has done  which is also a criticism that you hear from donald trump what would she do differently and whatever they have done hasnt ameliorated the threat allen well i think you know a couple of things and the strategy is working daesh is being defeated on the ground in iraq and syria its going to take a while weve always said that martin daesh is the arabic word for allen the socalled islamic state martin islamic state allen the idea of countering the messaging and stopping the flow of foreign fighters and strangling the finances and constricting its surface area  all of those things are having effect it took a while for it to happen we took those guys headon about  months ago and it takes a while to reverse strategic momentum and that strategic momentum is substantially reversed and i think well be able to continue that martin lastly donald trump has at some points during the campaign suggested that if he disagreed with generals about a particular national security issue that he would get them in line  that he would somehow override them as you have watched and listened to his rhetoric what has struck you the most  concerned you the most allen well i have to tell you one of the reasons that im doing this is the horror that i experienced the first time i heard him tell the american public that he would convince the generals to use the american military as an instrument of torture this is going to create a civil military crisis that has never occurred in this country before and words are windows into peoples souls the implication that potentially over the objections of our military and civilian leadership our military could be used as an instrument of torture or an instrument to track down and murder the families of terrorists thats a problem thats a problem and when our military may find itself in a situation where it has to say that is an illegal order issued by the president of the united states this is a civil military crisis martin retired marine corps general john allen thank you so much for taking the time allen rachel great to be

democratic convention battle of the generals flynn blasts allen for clinton endorsement published july   fox news facebook twitter livefyre email print   a battle of the brass has broken out in the wake of the republican and democratic party conventions as one of the top generals supporting donald trump lashes out at retired marine gen john allen who delivered a toughasnails endorsement of hillary clinton in philadelphia thursday night  “i honestly don’t know how john allen can look at himself in the mirror and say why he supports hillary clinton” retired army lt gen michael flynn told the kelly file both flynn and allen served in the obama administration but flynn who used to lead the defense intelligence agency has since become an outspoken critic of the president’s antiisis approach – while allen helped shape that strategy as the president’s special envoy for the antiisis coalition flynn who spoke at the cleveland republican convention last week on behalf of trump zeroed in on that portion of allen’s resume in challenging his credibility “general allen as a retired officer was in charge of our current strategy for well over a year … and during that period of time the rise of radical islamism and isis you know it exponentially grew” he said “the strategy that john allen was in charge of … it’s a failed strategy”   he said he was “a bit stunned” by his endorsement of clinton noting he and allen both worked with the former secretary of state “i cannot see how john allen can support somebody who perpetually cannot tell the truth” he said the stinging criticism between senior retired military officers is unusual even in a presidential campaign but the tensions could build as each presidential candidate suggests the other would put national security at risk in philadelphia allen who previously led forces in afghanistan vouched for clinton as the leader the country needs “we trust in her judgment we believe in her vision for a united america we believe in her vision of an america as a just and strong leader against the forces of hatred the forces of chaos and darkness” he said “i tell you without hesitation or reservation that hillary clinton will be exactly exactly the kind of commanderinchief america needs” allen walked on the philadelphia stage as democrats tried to put a sharper focus on security issues after being accused of glossing over isis and other terror threats the first two nights of their convention trump commented on the close of the convention by saying democrats were living in a “fantasy world”  rcp poll average  clinton vs
