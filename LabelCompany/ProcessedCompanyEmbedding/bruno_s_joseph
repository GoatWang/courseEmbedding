president of the new york state senate on november   ousting the incumbent ralph j marino bruno along with governor george pataki and assembly speaker sheldon silver was instrumental in returning the death penalty to new york state in  the new york court of appeals the highest state court in new york later found the law to be unconstitutional because it gave jurors deadlocked between life without parole and execution no choice but to give eligibility for parole after  years the court of appeals feared that jurors faced with this choice would unfairly lean toward a death sentence in the  years after the law was passed new yorks crime rate plummeted without ever seeing an execution perhaps weakening public support for the death penalty silver let the law die in  without much debate according to an editorial in the buffalo news bruno forced a bill through the senate on june   that would have forced girls under  to get consent from both parents for an abortion the bill never passed the new

biography of a living person needs additional citations for verification please help by adding reliable sources contentious material about living persons that is unsourced or poorly sourced must be removed immediately especially if potentially libelous or harmful january  learn how and when to remove this template message at the start of the  session it appeared the highly popular incoming governor eliot spitzer would be able to enact an ambitious reform agenda over the opposition of a weakened bruno however the  state budget was deemed by many as similar to the budgets approved during the pataki years which some dubbed a victory for bruno entering  brunos hold on senate control appeared more tenuous than in prior years as the republicans lost the seat formerly held by nicholas spano failed to regain a republicanleaning seat in syracuse and—with a caucus diminished to  members—had to defend the open seat of michael balboni in nassau county the latter seat was lost to democrat craig johnson nassau county legislator in a february   special election the electoral reverses and the ongoing fbi investigation led some republicans to suggest bruno might step down as majority leader there were also rumors some republican senators might cross the aisle to throw control of the senate to the democrats in april  bruno also appeared to hold veto power over two other spitzer initiatives gay marriage and campaign finance reform bruno challenged spitzer to restore the states death penalty law bruno also criticized the governors plan to issue driver licenses to illegal immigrants claiming it was aimed at stuffing the ballot box with democratic voters brunos position became more tenuous in february  after the special election loss of the heavily republican th district in watertown which had formerly been held by sen james w wright this loss diminished the republican senate majority to a single seat and press speculation centered on whether the remaining gop senate caucus would cause bruno to step down police surveillance controversyedit main article eliot spitzer political surveillance controversy on july   new york state attorney general andrew cuomo admonished governor eliot spitzers administration for ordering the state police to track brunos travel records particularly his use of a state helicopter at the direction of top officials of the spitzer administration the new york state police created documents meant to cause political damage to bruno the governors staff had stated they were responding to a freedom of information act foia or foil request from the timesunion of albany in late june on may  spitzers communications director darren dopp wrote rich baum a senior spitzer adviser that records exist going way back about brunos use of state aircraft and that also i think there is a new and different way to proceed re media will explain tomorrow dopp later wrote another email to baum after a story ran in the timesunion about a federal grand jury investigation of brunos investments in thoroughbred racing horses and wrote think travel story would fit nicely in the mix a page report issued by the attorney generals office concluded that spitzer aides attempted to create negative media coverage concerning brunos travel before any foia request was made the investigation looked into both brunos travel and the senate leaders allegation that spitzer used state police to spy on him cuomo concluded that these emails show that persons in the governors office did not merely produce records under a foil request but were instead engaged in planning and producing media coverage concerning senator brunos travel on state aircraft before any foil request was made it noted that the timesunions initial foil request didnt even ask for the records involving bruno that the paper was later given by aides to spitzer the timesunions requests sought documents on use of state aircraft by seven officials including spitzer bruno and lieutenant governor david paterson yet spitzers office released only brunos itinerary the spitzer administration and the state police provided far more details about bruno than about other officials to the timesunion including records to reply to a request under the states freedom of information laws though no such request had even been made the report noted that the state acted outside the laws in what it released such as documents that resembled official state travel records which they were not according to ellen nachtigall biben a former prosecutor in the manhattan district attorneys office who contributed to the report the report stated that the timesunion request came after the story about brunos travels was published and was not consistent with spitzer administration claims that all it did was respond to a foia request no other officials were subject to the same scrutiny as bruno and in some cases the reports created by state police were pieced together long after the trips sometimes based on the memory of the police escorts involved the report cleared bruno of any legal violations in his use of the states air fleet spitzer also used the state aircraft during the first six months of his term as governor for political purposes including a stop in rochester to attend an event for the monroe county democratic committee on a day in which he had a number of stops related to public business the report criticized spitzers office for using state police resources to gather information about brunos travel and releasing the information to the media spitzer responded at a july  press conference that as governor i am accountable for what goes on in the executive branch and i accept responsibility for the actions of my office and that his administration had grossly mishandled the situation spitzer issued an apology to bruno and stated that i apologized to senator bruno and i did so personally this morning however spitzers apology did not end the dispute four probes by the state attorney generals office the state senate investigations committee the albany county district attorneys office and the new york commission on public integrity the state ethics board are ongoing on march   the buffalo news reported former gov eliot l spitzer lied to prosecutors about his role in troopergate but the albany county district attorney said he will not pursue any criminal charges against the already disgraced exgovernor acting lieutenant governoredit on march   governor eliot spitzer resigned and lieutenant governor david paterson succeeded to

bruno resigned his new york state senate seat on november   he was replaced by his handpicked successor roy mcdonald in the general election reversal on samesex marriageedit almost one year after his stepping down from being senate majority leader bruno announced that he supported samesex marriage  a position that in the past he had never taken publicly after years of working with the relatively socially liberal governor george pataki whom conservative republicans criticized for his continued support of abortion rights and his heavy lobbying in favor of sonda a gay rights bill that languished in the state senate for many years as a result of brunos opposition bruno and his caucus were put on the spot for their support of a socially conservative agenda lgbt people and groups pushed very hard for the gay rights bill and in late  bruno finally gave in the bill passed the senate and was signed into law by governor pataki in  bruno was tapped by governor david paterson to speak out for samesex marriage in albany bruno also admitted in  that he personally favored samesex marriage but never brought it the floor of the state senate because the majority of his conference was against it stating this is america and we have inalienable rights life is short and we should all be afforded the same opportunities and rights to enjoy it criticismedit during the budget process in  bruno who was new to the majority leader role at the time made a comment about blacks and hispanics who got their hands out pressuring the legislature to avoid cuts to social services according to the syracuse poststandard bruno said he was referring to the black and puerto rican caucus which is a major force in the democratic majority in the assembly brunos defense was that he was referring to political caucuses not all blacks and hispanics he offered a blanket apology for offending some people but refused to take his words back fiscal conservative pundits originally were very supportive of brunos agenda in the state senate in later years they expressed concern over brunos willingness to cooperate with assembly speaker sheldon silver on budgets deemed to be excessive over endorsements bruno received from state employee labor unions including health care union local  and over brunos recruitment of former democrats to run as republicans for swing senate districts in syracuse and the bronx

ralph j marino bruno along with governor george pataki and assembly speaker sheldon silver was instrumental in returning the death penalty to new york state in  the new york court of appeals the highest state court in new york later found the law to be unconstitutional because it gave jurors deadlocked between life without parole and execution no choice but to give eligibility for parole after  years the court of appeals feared that jurors faced with this choice would unfairly lean toward a death sentence in the  years after the law was passed new yorks crime rate plummeted without ever seeing an execution perhaps weakening public support for the death penalty silver let the law die in  without much debate according to an editorial in the buffalo news bruno forced a bill through the senate on june   that would have forced girls under  to get consent from both parents for an abortion the bill never passed the new york state assembly in  bruno proposed research into highspeed

harmful january  learn how and when to remove this template message at the start of the  session it appeared the highly popular incoming governor eliot spitzer would be able to enact an ambitious reform agenda over the opposition of a weakened bruno however the  state budget was deemed by many as similar to the budgets approved during the pataki years which some dubbed a victory for bruno entering  brunos hold on senate control appeared more tenuous than in prior years as the republicans lost the seat formerly held by nicholas spano failed to regain a republicanleaning seat in syracuse and—with a caucus diminished to  members—had to defend the open seat of michael balboni in nassau county the latter seat was lost to democrat craig johnson nassau county legislator in a february   special election the electoral reverses and the ongoing fbi investigation led some republicans to suggest bruno might step down as majority leader there were also rumors some republican senators might cross the aisle to throw control of the senate to the democrats in april  bruno also appeared to hold veto power over two other spitzer initiatives gay marriage and campaign finance reform bruno challenged spitzer to restore the states death penalty law bruno also criticized the governors plan to issue driver licenses to illegal immigrants claiming it was aimed at stuffing the ballot box with democratic voters brunos position became more tenuous in february  after the special election loss of the heavily republican th district in watertown which had formerly been held by sen james w wright this loss diminished the republican senate majority to a single seat and press speculation centered on whether the remaining gop senate caucus would cause bruno to step down police surveillance controversyedit main article eliot spitzer political surveillance controversy on july   new york state attorney general andrew cuomo admonished governor eliot spitzers administration for ordering the state police to track brunos travel records particularly his use of a state helicopter at the direction of top officials of the spitzer administration the new york state police created documents meant to cause political damage to bruno the governors staff had stated they were responding to a freedom of information act foia or foil request from the timesunion of albany in late june on may  spitzers communications director darren dopp wrote rich baum a senior spitzer adviser that records exist going way back about brunos use of state aircraft and that also i think there is a new and different way to proceed re media will explain tomorrow dopp later wrote another email to baum after a story ran in the timesunion about a federal grand jury investigation of brunos investments in thoroughbred racing horses and wrote think travel story would fit nicely in the mix a page report issued by the attorney generals office concluded that spitzer aides attempted to create negative media coverage concerning brunos travel before any foia request was made the investigation looked into both brunos travel and the senate leaders allegation that spitzer used state police to spy on him cuomo concluded that these emails show that persons in the governors office did not merely produce records under a foil request but were instead engaged in planning and producing media coverage concerning senator brunos travel on state aircraft before any foil request was made it noted that the timesunions initial foil request didnt even ask for the records involving bruno that the paper was later given by aides to spitzer the timesunions requests sought documents on use of state aircraft by seven officials including spitzer bruno and lieutenant governor david paterson yet spitzers office released only brunos itinerary the spitzer administration and the state police provided far more details about bruno than about other officials to the timesunion including records to reply to a request under the states freedom of information laws though no such request had even been made the report noted that the state acted outside the laws in what it released such as documents that resembled official state travel records which they were not according to ellen nachtigall biben a former prosecutor in the manhattan district attorneys office who contributed to the report the report stated that the timesunion request came after the story about brunos travels was published and was not consistent with spitzer administration claims that all it did was respond to a foia request no other officials were subject to the same scrutiny as bruno and in some cases the reports created by state police were pieced together long after the trips sometimes based on the memory of the police escorts involved the report cleared bruno of any legal violations in his use of the states air fleet spitzer also used the state aircraft during the first six months of his term as governor for political purposes including a stop in rochester to attend an event for the monroe county democratic committee on a day in which he had a number of stops related to public business the report criticized spitzers office for using state police resources to gather information about brunos travel and releasing the information to the media spitzer responded at a july  press conference that as governor i am accountable for what goes on in the executive branch and i accept responsibility for the actions of my office and that his administration had grossly mishandled the situation spitzer issued an apology to bruno and stated that i apologized to senator bruno and i did so personally this morning however spitzers apology did not end the dispute four probes by the state attorney

silver was instrumental in returning the death penalty to new york state in  the new york court of appeals the highest state court in new york later found the law to be unconstitutional because it gave jurors deadlocked between life without parole and execution no choice but to give eligibility for parole after  years the court of appeals feared that jurors faced with this choice would unfairly lean toward a death sentence in the  years after the law was passed new yorks crime rate plummeted without ever seeing an execution perhaps weakening public support for the death penalty silver let the law die in  without much debate according to an editorial in the buffalo news bruno forced a bill through the senate on june   that would have forced girls under  to get consent from both parents for an abortion the bill never passed the new york state assembly in  bruno proposed research into highspeed rail development in new york state as part of a plan to boost upstate new yorks economy as

appeared the highly popular incoming governor eliot spitzer would be able to enact an ambitious reform agenda over the opposition of a weakened bruno however the  state budget was deemed by many as similar to the budgets approved during the pataki years which some dubbed a victory for bruno entering  brunos hold on senate control appeared more tenuous than in prior years as the republicans lost the seat formerly held by nicholas spano failed to regain a republicanleaning seat in syracuse and—with a caucus diminished to  members—had to defend the open seat of michael balboni in nassau county the latter seat was lost to democrat craig johnson nassau county legislator in a february   special election the electoral reverses and the ongoing fbi investigation led some republicans to suggest bruno might step down as majority leader there were also rumors some republican senators might cross the aisle to throw control of the senate to the democrats in april  bruno also appeared to hold veto power over two other spitzer initiatives gay marriage and campaign finance reform bruno challenged spitzer to restore the states death penalty law bruno also criticized the governors plan to issue driver licenses to illegal immigrants claiming it was aimed at stuffing the ballot box with democratic voters brunos position became more tenuous in february  after the special election loss of the heavily republican th district in watertown which had formerly been held by sen james w wright this loss diminished the republican senate majority to a single seat and press speculation centered on whether the remaining gop senate caucus would cause bruno to step down police surveillance controversyedit main article eliot spitzer political surveillance controversy on july   new york state attorney general andrew cuomo admonished governor eliot spitzers administration for ordering the state police to track brunos travel records particularly his use of a state helicopter at the direction of top officials of the spitzer administration the new york state police created documents meant to cause political damage to bruno the governors staff had stated they were responding to a freedom of information act foia or foil request from the timesunion of albany in late june on may  spitzers communications director darren dopp wrote rich baum a senior spitzer adviser that records exist going way back about brunos use of state aircraft and that also i think there is a new and different way to proceed re media will explain tomorrow dopp later wrote another email to baum after a story ran in the timesunion about a federal grand jury investigation of brunos investments in thoroughbred racing horses and wrote think travel story would fit nicely in the mix a page report issued by the attorney generals office concluded that spitzer aides attempted to create negative media coverage concerning brunos travel before any foia request was made the investigation looked into both brunos travel and the senate leaders allegation that spitzer used state police to spy on him cuomo concluded that these emails show that persons in the governors office did not merely produce records under a foil request but were instead engaged in planning and producing media coverage concerning senator brunos travel on state aircraft before any foil request was made it noted that the timesunions initial foil request didnt even ask for the records involving bruno that the paper was later given by aides to spitzer the timesunions requests sought documents on use of state aircraft by seven officials including spitzer bruno and lieutenant governor david paterson yet spitzers office released only brunos itinerary the spitzer administration and the state police provided far more details about bruno than about other officials to the timesunion including records to reply to a request under the states freedom of information laws though no such request had even been made the report noted that the state acted outside the laws in what it released such as documents that resembled official state travel records which they were not according to ellen nachtigall biben a former prosecutor in the manhattan district attorneys office who contributed to the report the report stated that the timesunion request came after the story about brunos travels was published and was not consistent with spitzer administration claims that all it did was respond to a foia request no other officials were subject to the same scrutiny as bruno and in some cases the reports created by state police were pieced together long after the trips sometimes based on the memory of the police escorts involved the report cleared bruno of any legal violations in his use of the states air fleet spitzer also used the state aircraft during the first six months of his term as governor for political purposes including a stop in rochester to attend an event for the monroe county democratic committee on a day in which he had a number of stops related to public business the report criticized spitzers office for using state police resources to gather information about brunos travel and releasing the information to the media spitzer responded at a july  press conference that as governor i am accountable for what goes on in the executive branch and i accept responsibility for the actions of my office and that his administration had grossly mishandled the situation spitzer issued an apology to bruno and stated that i apologized to senator bruno and i did so personally this morning however spitzers apology did not end the dispute four probes by the state attorney generals office the state senate investigations committee the albany county district attorneys office and the new york commission on public integrity the state ethics board are ongoing on march   the buffalo news reported former gov eliot l spitzer lied to prosecutors about his role in troopergate but the albany county district attorney

after his stepping down from being senate majority leader bruno announced that he supported samesex marriage  a position that in the past he had never taken publicly after years of working with the relatively socially liberal governor george pataki whom conservative republicans criticized for his continued support of abortion rights and his heavy lobbying in favor of sonda a gay rights bill that languished in the state senate for many years as a result of brunos opposition bruno and his caucus were put on the spot for their support of a socially conservative agenda lgbt people and groups pushed very hard for the gay rights bill and in late  bruno finally gave in the bill passed the senate and was signed into law by governor pataki in  bruno was tapped by governor david paterson to speak out for samesex marriage in albany bruno also admitted in  that he personally favored samesex marriage but never brought it the floor of the state senate because the majority of his conference was against it stating this is america and we have inalienable rights life is short and we should all be afforded the same opportunities and rights to enjoy it criticismedit during the budget process in  bruno who was new to the majority leader role at the time made a comment about blacks and hispanics who got their hands out pressuring the legislature to avoid cuts to social services according to the syracuse poststandard bruno said he was referring to the black and puerto rican caucus which is a major force in the democratic majority in the assembly brunos defense was that he was referring to political caucuses not all blacks and hispanics he offered a blanket apology for offending some people but refused to take his words back fiscal conservative pundits originally were very supportive of brunos agenda in the state senate in later years they expressed concern over brunos willingness to cooperate with assembly speaker sheldon silver on budgets deemed to be excessive over endorsements

ralph j marino bruno along with governor george pataki and assembly speaker sheldon silver was instrumental in returning the death penalty to new york state in  the new york court of appeals the highest state court in new york later found the law to be unconstitutional because it gave jurors deadlocked between life without parole and execution no choice but to give eligibility for parole after  years the court of appeals feared that jurors faced with this choice would unfairly lean toward a death sentence in the  years after the law was passed new yorks crime rate plummeted without ever seeing an execution perhaps weakening public support for the death penalty silver let the law die in  without much debate according to an editorial in the buffalo news bruno forced a bill through the senate on june   that would have forced girls under  to get consent from both parents for an abortion the bill never passed the new york state assembly in  bruno proposed research into highspeed

harmful january  learn how and when to remove this template message at the start of the  session it appeared the highly popular incoming governor eliot spitzer would be able to enact an ambitious reform agenda over the opposition of a weakened bruno however the  state budget was deemed by many as similar to the budgets approved during the pataki years which some dubbed a victory for bruno entering  brunos hold on senate control appeared more tenuous than in prior years as the republicans lost the seat formerly held by nicholas spano failed to regain a republicanleaning seat in syracuse and—with a caucus diminished to  members—had to defend the open seat of michael balboni in nassau county the latter seat was lost to democrat craig johnson nassau county legislator in a february   special election the electoral reverses and the ongoing fbi investigation led some republicans to suggest bruno might step down as majority leader there were also rumors some republican senators might cross the aisle to throw control of the senate to the democrats in april  bruno also appeared to hold veto power over two other spitzer initiatives gay marriage and campaign finance reform bruno challenged spitzer to restore the states death penalty law bruno also criticized the governors plan to issue driver licenses to illegal immigrants claiming it was aimed at stuffing the ballot box with democratic voters brunos position became more tenuous in february  after the special election loss of the heavily republican th district in watertown which had formerly been held by sen james w wright this loss diminished the republican senate majority to a single seat and press speculation centered on whether the remaining gop senate caucus would cause bruno to step down police surveillance controversyedit main article eliot spitzer political surveillance controversy on july   new york state attorney general andrew cuomo admonished governor eliot spitzers administration for ordering the state police to track brunos travel records particularly his use of a state helicopter at the direction of top officials of the spitzer administration the new york state police created documents meant to cause political damage to bruno the governors staff had stated they were responding to a freedom of information act foia or foil request from the timesunion of albany in late june on may  spitzers communications director darren dopp wrote rich baum a senior spitzer adviser that records exist going way back about brunos use of state aircraft and that also i think there is a new and different way to proceed re media will explain tomorrow dopp later wrote another email to baum after a story ran in the timesunion about a federal grand jury investigation of brunos investments in thoroughbred racing horses and wrote think travel story would fit nicely in the mix a page report issued by the attorney generals office concluded that spitzer aides attempted to create negative media coverage concerning brunos travel before any foia request was made the investigation looked into both brunos travel and the senate leaders allegation that spitzer used state police to spy on him cuomo concluded that these emails show that persons in the governors office did not merely produce records under a foil request but were instead engaged in planning and producing media coverage concerning senator brunos travel on state aircraft before any foil request was made it noted that the timesunions initial foil request didnt even ask for the records involving bruno that the paper was later given by aides to spitzer the timesunions requests sought documents on use of state aircraft by seven officials including spitzer bruno and lieutenant governor david paterson yet spitzers office released only brunos itinerary the spitzer administration and the state police provided far more details about bruno than about other officials to the timesunion including records to reply to a request under the states freedom of information laws though no such request had even been made the report noted that the state acted outside the laws in what it released such as documents that resembled official state travel records which they were not according to ellen nachtigall biben a former prosecutor in the manhattan district attorneys office who contributed to the report the report stated that the timesunion request came after the story about brunos travels was published and was not consistent with spitzer administration claims that all it did was respond to a foia request no other officials were subject to the same scrutiny as bruno and in some cases the reports created by state police were pieced together long after the trips sometimes based on the memory of the police escorts involved the report cleared bruno of any legal violations in his use of the states air fleet spitzer also used the state aircraft during the first six months of his term as governor for political purposes including a stop in rochester to attend an event for the monroe county democratic committee on a day in which he had a number of stops related to public business the report criticized spitzers office for using state police resources to gather information about brunos travel and releasing the information to the media spitzer responded at a july  press conference that as governor i am accountable for what goes on in the executive branch and i accept responsibility for the actions of my office and that his administration had grossly mishandled the situation spitzer issued an apology to bruno and stated that i apologized to senator bruno and i did so personally this morning however spitzers apology did not end the dispute four probes by the state attorney generals office the state senate investigations committee the albany county district attorneys office and the new york commission on public integrity the state ethics board are ongoing on march   the

bruno announced that he supported samesex marriage  a position that in the past he had never taken publicly after years of working with the relatively socially liberal governor george pataki whom conservative republicans criticized for his continued support of abortion rights and his heavy lobbying in favor of sonda a gay rights bill that languished in the state senate for many years as a result of brunos opposition bruno and his caucus were put on the spot for their support of a socially conservative agenda lgbt people and groups pushed very hard for the gay rights bill and in late  bruno finally gave in the bill passed the senate and was signed into law by governor pataki in  bruno was tapped by governor david paterson to speak out for samesex marriage in albany bruno also admitted in  that he personally favored samesex marriage but never brought it the floor of the state senate because the majority of his conference was against it stating this is america and we have inalienable rights life is short and we should all be afforded the same opportunities and rights to enjoy it criticismedit during the budget process in  bruno who was new to the majority leader role at the time made a comment about blacks and hispanics who got their hands out pressuring the legislature to avoid cuts to social services according to the syracuse poststandard bruno said he was referring to the black and puerto rican caucus which is a major force in the democratic majority in the assembly brunos defense was that he was referring to political caucuses not all blacks and hispanics he offered a blanket apology for offending some people but refused to take his words back fiscal conservative pundits originally were very supportive of brunos agenda in the state senate in later years they expressed concern over brunos willingness to cooperate with assembly speaker sheldon silver on budgets deemed to be excessive over endorsements bruno received from state employee labor unions including health care union local  and over brunos recruitment of former democrats to run as republicans for swing senate districts in syracuse and the bronx in december  bruno disclosed
