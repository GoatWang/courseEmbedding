economy energy media technology personal tech entrepreneurship your money digital equipment loses another of its top officials by glenn rifkin published may   in the midst of a painful struggle to return to profitability the digital equipment corporation lost yet another executive when the chief financial officer william m steul resigned yesterday the company announced that its controller vincent j mullarkey  who has been at digital for  years would become a vice president and the chief financial officer mr steul was named chief financial officer by the founder of digital kenneth h olsen in june  weeks before the board asked mr olsen to resign as president mr steuls rise had been controversial because he had not worked in the finance operation for more than a decade when robert b palmer succeeded mr olsen he retained mr steul but several executives have left the company including edward lucente vice president of worldwide sales and marketing edward mcdonough vice president of manufacturing and winston hindle vice president of quality ethics and business practices a spokeswoman for digital said the departures of mr mcdonough and mr hindle were planned retirements last month the company reported a  million loss for its third fiscal quarter and mr palmer conceded that he had been caught by surprise by the severity of the loss analysts speculated that mr steul might have been a victim of that debacle as mr palmer sought stronger finanical leadership for the company franc romano a former digital finance manager and market research director and now a consultant with the aberdeen group in boston said mr steul had stepped into a job that nobody in the company wanted and to some extent has taken the rap for the companys poor performance mr romano said he was disappointed that mr palmer had not used this opportunity to look outside digital and bring in much needed financial leadership and talent vins only job has been at digital mr romano added and i dont think he brings the broad business experience that palmer says he does to digital controller for  months mr palmer said in a statement that digital was making steady progress back to profitability and that the appointment of mr mullarkey with his background in financial management and controls is consistent with our determination to concentrate on accelerating that progress mr mullarkey has held financialmanagement positions in digital operations and business units in europe asia and the united states and he has been corporate controller reporting to mr steul for  months in an interview mr mullarkey said he was surprised by mr steuls decision to step down but would not comment on why that decision was made he did say mr steul had recommended him as his successor mr steul was not available for comment mr mullarkey said digitals finance organization was strong i dont expect well miss a beat he said i plan to crank up the rpms and move forward aggressively he said he was focusing on restoring competitiveness and emphasizing a return to sustainable profitability he said reducing costs and improving asset management and cash positions would be crucial as digital moved to its next phase of renovation mr palmer told employees last month that the company would cut an additional  workers beginning in the next fiscal year which starts on july  digital has also said it will incur another significant restructuring charge possibly as high as  billion according to analysts mr mullarkey said details might be announced at the end of next month im focusing on optimizing the company while its in transition mr mullarkey said this can be very complicated particuarly with the further level of downsizing we have to deal with we dont want to lose control during this time weekly closing of books mr mullarkey added that he was putting into place controls to help increase the predictability of quarterly results a problem for digital in recent quarters mr mullarkey said digital was closing its books weekly rather than monthly to avoid missing important changes like aggressive discounting late in a quarter i know of no other companies doing it like this he said mr mullarkey also responded to reports published yesterday about a memo from the digital treasurer ilene jacobs that warned executives that the cash level for the company was in jeopardy cash on hand is largely on target with our expectations he said ms jacobss memo had a couple of very bold statements that the reports had taken out of context he said   inside nytimescom health raquo too hot to
