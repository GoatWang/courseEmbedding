earnest alert message skip to content earnest about us we believe many financially responsible people aren’t getting the credit they deserve that’s why we strive to eliminate unnecessary costs from the banking process and offer our clients the low rates they deserve why we started earnest we believe the fundamental role of banks and lenders is to help people realize their hopes and dreams but we realized the financial system had forgotten this primary purpose instead serving to enrich a privileged few so we started earnest to restore the trust that is sorely missing from the current system and to build a modern financial institution that actually delivers on making clients’ lives better whatever your ambition we help get you there we do lowcost lending to financially responsible people and allow them to customize their repayment plan to fit their needs we want to help our clients take control of their finances and realize their dreams—and in doing so create a relationship with them that lasts a lifetime who we are we are a skilled team of design math finance and technology geeks who noticed a lack of trust in the financial system and decided to do something about it we created a company that combines data science streamlined design and exceptional service to bring people a fast lowcost and hyperpersonalized financial experience our mission is to make credit more accessible by
