worldwide leader in its industry styslinger was born in birmingham in  to lee j styslinger sr and margaret mcfarland styslinger where his father had moved at age  because it resembled his hometown of pittsburgh there at the start of the depression lee styslinger sr founded alabama truck equipment co with a handful of employees in a building that had originally been a furniture manufacturing plant

co a line of bottler bodies for cocacola and buffalo rock a line of dairy bodies dump bodies bakery bodies for mcgough bakeries van bodies for baggett and jack cole motor freight and any special type
