storage assets in these chains and also production assets within the natural gas value chain mlps are a usonly investment because one of their primary features is advantageous us federal tax treatment typically about 0 of their distributions are taxdeferred though this can change when mlps are included in pooled investment vehicles like closedend funds the total return of mlp investments is typically based on their distributions and on demand for energy because they are highly concentrated in the energy sector however they can be more negatively affected by a downturn in the energy
