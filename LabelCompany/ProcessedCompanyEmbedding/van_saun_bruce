search an interview with bruce van saun chairman and ceo of citizens financial group the ceo of the country’s newest standalone big bank discusses the progress it’s made since going public in  john maxfield johnmaxfield may   at am as the chairman and ceo of citizens financial group nysecfg bruce van saun is overseeing a comprehensive turnaround at one of the nations biggest banks its still too soon for van saun to declare victory but if the providence rhode islandbased bank continues on its current path it could soon emerge as one of the countrys topperforming regional banks i had the opportunity to discuss citizens progress with van saun what follows is the transcript of our conversation edited for organization and flow john maxfield is citizens a turnaround story bruce van saun the description of citizens as a turnaround story is valid we were owned by a foreign parent royal bank of scotland that ran into some difficulties in the financial crisis as a result we were playing defense for an extended period of time in terms of shrinking the balance sheet and raising capital levels bruce van saun chairman and ceo of citizens financial group image source citizens financial group when i came over to citizens from rbs in october  our goal was to benchmark our performance against peers start playing offense and turn the company around it has a good foundation in place with a strong regional focus in an affluent part of the country as well as a good balance between consumer and commercial but it had been undermanaged we built a very clear plan we had a high capital ratio after being birthed by rbs so one of the early initiatives was to put the capital back to work and start leveraging up the balance sheet by finding attractive areas to grow loans then it was about investing in our feebased businesses and improving our capabilities broadly in terms of what we could deliver to customers the plan was fairly straightforward and weve executed on it well our performance was initially behind our peers but now weve pretty much caught up with them we like to say now that were turning the corner were moving out of our turnaround phase maxfield how is it that citizens loan book is growing twice as fast as other leading regional banks van saun its a number of things weve been underpenetrated relative to our potential on the commercial banking side so we went out and recruited experienced commercial bankers many of whom have relationships with companies that are above the middle market  ones with more than  million in annual revenue to serve these companies you need industry expertise so we set up a healthcare group a technology group an energy group and weve been bringing over bankers who have strong relationships in these industries when theres an opportunity to enter into a credit relationship with these companies were there to do so then we hopefully move over and become a more important bank for them the other side is the commercial real estate business as part of rbss efforts to reduce its exposure to commercial real estate citizens became underweight in it even telling longstanding customers that we werent open for that kind of business so when i came over we flipped the sign around to say shop open a lot of those customers liked working with citizens in the past and have rotated us back in on the consumer side there wasnt initially a lot of loan demand the only game in town was auto lending so we revved that up a bit entering into a relationship with santander usa to gain experience and exposure to prime auto paper we viewed that as a bridge once demand picked up in other areas we would rotate out of that auto exposure which is exactly whats happening we saw opportunities to jump into education refinance loans too were one of the bigger players there thats given us a bit of momentum and growth weve also hired  new mortgage officers bringing the total to  weve entered into strategic partnerships with companies like apple and hp as well to help them deliver installment credit to some of their customers and weve grown in the personal unsecured market by having a debt consolidation product for people with highinterest credit card loans you have to be selective you have to be judicious about where youre playing and be innovative on the consumer side but thats whats allowed us to grow the yield on our loans is up the return on capital employed in our loan book is up but our projected loan losses in stress tests are down so were achieving better riskadjusted returns while reducing risk the one thing we have to focus on is that while we have plenty of capital our loantodeposit ratio ended the first quarter at  so if were going to grow loans at a good clip we need to continue growing deposits as well because we fund each dollar in loan growth with a dollar of deposit growth and we want to find those deposits in a costeffective manner maxfield how does a newly independent bank ensure that it maintains discipline in future cycles van saun that comes from having years of experience and the wisdom you gain from that my team have all been around the block and in the industry for many years most of us for  or  years so weve seen the cycles the key is to maintain your underwriting standards and to back away from the market when things are too frothy stresstesting has been really good in this regard in terms of making decisions about loan exposure so the combination of having experience undergoing annual stress tests and then marrying these to sophisticated tools for identifying risk gives us a fair amount of confidence that we should perform in line with our peer group if not better in future cycles we have good granularity in our portfolios you dont want to get too overweight in any particular industry or geography thats an important aspect of it another is just not chasing growth for growth sake maxfield what role does technology play in citizens plans van saun the real frontier in banking is around digitization the objective is to make sure consumers and companies can bank however they want to bank with you  be it in a branch on a smartphone or personal computer whatever whether its checking balances making deposits making payments digital is really where the next frontier is so we have to pivot from some of the large mainframe and more central approach to serving customers to being able to move digitally and really focus on the customer experience thats the area were moving aggressively into another area were looking at is cloud computing do we need to have such a big investment in mainframes and servers can we move some of that to the cloud this gives a bank more flexibility and shortens your development time meaning that you can get products to market faster thats really exciting if we can be responsive to customers and it doesnt take us a year and a day to satisfy their needs maxfield open application programming interfaces or open apis are a big deal right now what are your thoughts on them van saun i think theyre very helpful you want your core systems to be open so we can take in apis and then use the best minds that are developing great products to wrap those into our offerings so i think thats a real positive were not of the size and scale to invent everything here but if were nimble and flexible and have an open infrastructure that can accept apis to plug in some of these great fintech products and services then we can keep up with the big guys and maybe even get a little ahead in some instances i do worry that if the developers dont have great security against hacking and cyber threats that the liability will go back to the deep pockets  the bank so you have to have very clear rules of the road in terms of who has access to the information and how they use it maxfield your latest shareholder letter mentions that citizens recently invested in advanced analytics or big data what have you seen so far van saun the increased use of data analytics is really about having a repository of data on households be it households that we serve today or households that could be our customers in the future a popular product for the mass affluent for example is a home equity line of credit most of those folks own their own homes and have some appreciation in them that they can tap into as a relatively inexpensive means of securing credit so we can use data analytics to identify and prioritize effective offers to these customers its still early but weve seen powerful results in some of our direct mail campaigns the conversion rate has been two to three times greater than the conversion rate of past campaigns its similar to approaches that many consumer products companies already use banks have just been behind the curve in understanding the profiles of their customers and that they can use that data to better serve customers ultimately big data will become table stakes to compete in the bank industry fastforward five years from now and everyone will be doing this but right now banks that are using big data effectively have an edge and may be able to grow and solidify their customer base before other banks get in on it maxfield to be a topperforming regional bank citizens credit rating will need to improve are there specific plans in place to address this van saun weve been in active dialogue with the ratings agencies about making sure they understand our plan and the progress weve made theyve taken comfort in our fortress balance sheet and i think the reason our rating isnt where wed like it at this point is that our earnings levels have been lower than peers that gap is rapidly diminishing but the ratings agencies tend to look more out of the rearview mirror than the front windshield so well need to have a more sustained level of improved operations at the current level to get us a better rating were just trying to make sure they understand our plan and are comfortable that were not taking undue risk our capital position is strong and our earnings are improving so they can look at us in a new light and have confidence in terms of where we are maxfield is there any reason to believe that the recent news about the citizens checkup initiative will have a material impact on the banks performance van saun no and we said that from the getgo when the story first ran this is a good program for customers what were doing is inviting them in for a free consultation to understand where they are on their lifes journey and then trying to figure out if they have the right set of products and services to help them achieve their goals the customers who have gone through the program love it survey results show that  of customers enjoy the experience and  would recommend it to someone else so i think the program is aligned with knowing your customers making sure youre offering suitable products if the wall street journal found a few people who claimed that theres pressure to set appointments or that they didnt always file the proper submissions around calling efforts we have a full

turnaround motley fool staff themotleyfool jun   at pm when bruce van saun took the helm at citizens financial group nysecfg in  things looked bleak its parent company at the time royal bank of scotland nyserbs had spent years trying to shrink and derisk its balance sheet leaving citizens financial well behind its peers in areas like commercial real estate loans and mortgages things started to improve after citizens was spun off from rbs in a  initial public offering since then the rhode islandbased banks prospects have improved meaningfully thanks in no small part to van saun in this segment of industry focus financials the motley fools gaby lapera and contributor john maxfield dive into citizens financials turnaround story a full transcript follows the video this video was recorded on may   gaby lapera the other thing that you mentioned earlier was van saun the ceo hes kind of been an angel for citizens financial hes really the person who seems to be driving this new culture and new ideas that are helping the bank in their turnaround story john maxfield bruce van saun has been an executive at a lot of different major institutions i talked to richard bove one of the most respected banks analysts in the country hes a veteran bank analyst hes been around hes on cnbc all the time talking about banks he writes notes to his clients every day and i consider them to be pretty good commentary when i talked to richard about this  he goes by dick  when i talked to dick about this i asked him what do you think about bruce van saun and he told me literally that bruce van saun is an excellent banker mind you dick bove is someone who doesnt mince words when he doesnt like a bank ceo so i consider that to be pretty high praise and it really did corroborate my thinking and help to crystallize my thinking on citizens and back up what the numbers were saying to me in terms of citizens performance lapera yeah so why dont you talk a little bit about some of the stuff that van saun has done to improve citizens position like their recruitment efforts or their tech investments or stuff like that maxfield ok so let me paint a picture with some numbers for you last year citizens grew its loan book by  about  its peer group average these are other banks that are a few hundred billion in assets grew their loans last year by  so it outperformed on loan growth so thats an important thing to keep in mind another is that the revenue it makes sense that the revenue would grow fast because the main product that a bank sells is loans and if youre selling more loans your revenue is going to go up their revenue last year rose by  versus  for the average competitor then the efficiency ratio which we talk about all the time in the context of banking on this show which tells you the percent of revenue that a bank spends on operating expenses it fell by  basis points so by  i think its now starting to close in on that  threshold that banks strive for so if you look at those three metrics which are probably the most important metrics when youre analyzing a banks performance it had a really really good year so the question is as a general rule and i think this is a good way to think about things as an investor and to think about things in general to think about general rules and exceptions  this is actually how lawyers are taught to think the general rule in the case of loan growth is you want loan growth to be robust but any time that loan growth outperforms the peer group average you have to look at that askance because the general rule is that loan growth that is too fast is concerning because it means that youre going out and making loans maybe to people who shouldnt be getting them lapera and for listeners who are a little bit newer to banking every time a bank makes a loan you have underwriters who check to see how risky is this person are they likely to pay back their debt during the financial crisis of  banks were not very strict at underwriting and you saw what happened so thats the concern when you see super rapid loan growth do you think thats whats happening here with citizens maxfield to your question gaby your original question was talk about the things theyre doing and investments theyve made i think its rapid loan growth is more a function of not necessarily reducing the underwriting standards which is what youre referring to and i was referring to in that general rule its more about the fact that it was so underconcentrated in these loan groups relative to other banks that it had a ton of upward momentum that was just waiting for it to take advantage of lapera real quick the loan groups that youre talking about are the commercial real estate and regular home loans right maxfield right commercial real estate is one of the main ones home loans is another one basically what citizens did is once it spun off from the royal bank of scotland and it had more operational flexibility to make investments in the business and to grow as opposed to contract what they did is went out and almost doubled their staff of mortgage officers if youre going to double your staff the number of people who are your loan officers then you should expect to grow a lot faster and theyre going out and recruiting loan officers that deal with larger companies from other banks and those loan officers from these other banks that have these large accounts are bringing those accounts over so when you start to put all those pieces together you start to say oh ok it makes sense now that its loan book is growing faster than its other book and it makes sense for reasons other than the fact that whether a bank is or is not manipulating the underwriting standards gaby lapera has no position in any stocks mentioned john

john woods thanks bruce good morning everyone id like to first say that im extremely pleased to have the opportunity to join bruce and the citizens team on the journey to build the topperforming bank since the ipo bruce and the team have made tremendous progress with great momentum coming in to  since my early days here at citizens i am taking on the leadership in three highpriority areas first balance sheet funding optimization second continuation of our top initiatives to grow the bottom line and selffund strategic initiatives and third partnering with don and brad in driving fee revenue growth we had some success in these areas and i hope to contribute to further enhancements going forward im impressed by the quality of our leadership team and their clear understanding of our direction and what were trying to achieve in short im excited about the opportunities that lie before us so with that lets jump into our first quarter financials which start on slide  we’ve generated record net income of  million and diluted eps of  per share these results were up  and  linked quarter and up  and  respectively yearoveryear i’d like to remind you that we did benefit from approximately  million related to the settlement of certain state tax matters that lowered the tax rate by  percentage points and added  to eps excluding the tax settlement impact net income was up  eps was up  and the tax rate would have been  note also that under new accounting rules for equity compensation we had a modest benefit in tax expense this has been included in our first quarter and full year guidance operating leverage was positive linked quarter and yearover year we generated positive operating leverage of  driven by revenue growth of  our net interest margin increased six basis points linked quarter and  basis points yearoveryear and we improved our efficiency ration  basis points from fourth quarter and roughly  year on year to  these strong results reflect good execution of our strategic initiatives and our commitment to drive revenue growth while maintaining operating expense discipline our rotce of  improved  in the fourth quarter and  yearoveryear on an underlying basis rotce of  was up  basis points linked quarter and  percentage points yearoveryear taking a deeper look into nii and nim on slides  and  we continue to deliver strong balance sheet growth which helped us to deliver a record  billion in nii we grew average loans  linked quarter and  yearoveryear and i will provide some additional color on the growth in a few minutes margin improved six basis points linked quarter and  basis points yearoveryear which reflects improving loan yields thanks for the pickup in interest rates and the impact our balance sheet optimization efforts these benefits were partially offset by higher deposit and funding costs the deposit costs increase reflects growth in commercial deposits over the quarter the impact of higher interest rates and mix shift in consumer to more term and time note that we grew periodend deposits by over  in q which reduced the spot ldr to  turning to fees on slide  linked quarter fees were up slightly as strong results in capital markets and card fees helped overcome some seasonal impact linked quarter service charges were slightly down reflecting seasonality in day count card fees increased from revised contract terms commencing this quarter for core processing fees and a reduction in rewards expense we had another record quarter in capital markets driven by loan syndications bond underwriting and advisory fees we saw  million increase in trust and investment services fees thanks to higher investment sales volumes as weve added wealth advisors and continue to invest significantly in our wealth platform foreign exchange and interest rate product fees were down modestly from strong fourth quarter levels while mortgage banking fees were down from fourth quarter levels that included higher msr valuations and higher origination volumes on a yearoveryear basis we delivered outstanding noninterest income growth which is up  million or  the story is much the same as the biggest drivers of improvement came from capital markets card fees and foreign exchange and interest rates products and income turning to expenses on slide  we saw a slight increase in linked quarter expenses largely as a seasonal increase in salaries and benefits and occupancy was partially offset by lower insurance fraud and regulatory costs outside services and equipment expenses compared to first quarter  expenses increased  but there is some noise in those numbers that i want to call out for you that elevates the growth in salaries and benefits and other expense lines the biggest driver was an increase in salaries and benefits of  million but that includes a change in the timing of incentive payments last year the payment was made in second quarter and we pulled this forward this year into the first quarter impacting payroll taxes and k expense other expense increased  million which includes the impact of the fdic insurance surcharge which was not a factor in q  when we exclude those items the yearoveryear expense growth rate was closer to  let’s move on and discuss the balance sheet on slide  you can see the continued benefit of our efforts to grow our balance sheet and expand our nim we grew average loans  linked quarter and  yearoveryear reflecting growth across most of our commercial business lines and in education mortgage and unsecured retail on the consumer side nim was up six basis points in the quarter and  basis points yearoveryear reflecting improved loan yields partially offset by higher deposit costs we’ve done a nice job of improving our loan yields giving our balance sheet optimization efforts along with greater discipline on pricing weve also benefited from higher libor during the quarter as the market anticipated the tightening by the fed we remain well positioned to capitalize on the rising rate environment with asset sensitivity to a gradual rise in rates at  at the quarter end on pages  and  we provide more detail on the loan growth in consumer and commercial in consumer  average growth was led by continued expansion in education residential mortgages and other unsecured retail loans which was driven by our partnership with apple and our new personal unsecured product we continue to improve and enhance our portfolio mix by driving growth in higherreturn categories we are slowing growth in auto and that will likely accelerate in the back half of the year as our partnership with scusa comes to a close in april and we further reduce volumes in select geographic areas as a result of these efforts in addition to higher rates we’ve expanded portfolio yields by  basis points in the quarter and  basis points yearoveryear we also saw nice growth in commercial where we continue to execute well in commercial real estate midcorporate and middlemarket industry verticals and franchise finance the increase in rates and enhanced rigor around the acquired portfolio of returns have helped drive a  basis point improvement in yields linked quarter and a  basis point increase yearoveryear on page  looking at the funding side we saw a five basis point increase in our total funding cost with a  basis point increase in deposit costs mostly tied to growth in commercial deposits yearoveryear our cost of funds were up nine basis points reflecting substantial growth in higher cost commercial deposits to fund robust loan growth as well as the impact of higher rates in terming out some of our borrowed funds next let’s move to slide  and cover credit overall credit quality continues to be strong reflecting the continued mix shift towards highquality lower risk retail loans compared with growth in the larger company segments of our commercial book the nonperforming loan ratio remained flat to fourth quarter levels at  basis points of loans and improved from  basis points a year ago the net chargeoff rate decreased to  basis points from more elevated in q levels that included a  million increase in the auto portfolio related to a onetime methodology change retail net chargeoffs decreased  million while our commercial net charge offs were up slightly provision for credit losses of  million decreased  million from relatively high fourth quarter levels as we continue to grow higher quality retail portfolios our allowance for total loans and leases ratio has moved down modestly to  on slide  you can see that we continue to maintain strong capital and liquidity positions this quarter as part of our  ccar plan we’ve repurchased  million shares and returned over  million to share holders including dividend we ended the quarter with a cet ratio of  as a reminder our ccar capital plan targets the repurchase of up to  million in shares in the second quarter of  its also worth noting that the total and not returned to shareholders to date is  quarters of the  ccar window at  million including dividends on slide  we show an update on progress against our strategic initiatives i’d like to highlight that we continue to drive attractive loan growth across a number of areas in consumer we continued with strength in our mortgage loan officer recruitment efforts reaching  at quarter end which should help provide an offset to industry wide origination headwinds we continue to reduce the auto program to enhance return and weve seen really strong growth in our education refinance loan products which has attractive riskadjusted returns in wealth we saw nice plus in fees this quarter with the total investment sales up  linked quarter and  yearoveryear we continue to make progress in a yearoveryear basis in shifting the mix of our sales towards more feebased business which came in at  compared to  in q  in addition our fb headcount is up  which is contributing towards the scale in the business commercial continues to deliver impressive results with a strong quarter and capital and global markets demonstrating the potential of these businesses given our expanded capabilities the build out of treasury solutions is also on the right track with higher fee income growth linked quarter and yearoveryear along with strong momentum in our commercial card program moving on to slide  the top programs have successfully delivered efficiencies that have allowed us to selffund investments to improve our platforms and product offerings in  our top  program delivered  million in annual pretax benefits across our revenue and expense initiatives our top  program which launched in mid is on track to deliver targeted run rate benefit of  million to  million by the end of  we have been working on a top  program and we expect to provide additional details on this on our second quarter call on slide  you can see the steady progress we are making against our financial targets since q  our rotce has improved from  to  which equates to  on an underlying basis our efficiency ratio has improved by  over that same time frame from  to  and eps continues on a very strong trajectory as well more than doubling from  to  on an underlying basis lets turn to our second quarter outlook on slide  we expect a pretty linked quarter loan growth of around  on a periodend basis and  on an average basis we continue to project fullyear loan growth to be within the  to  fullyear guidance range we also expect net interest margin to continue to expand by about three basis points to four basis points linked quarter given the forward curve benefit in noninterest income we are expecting to see a sequential decrease given the strong first quarter results in capital markets the commercial activity pipelines have moderated somewhat as the market reassesses the political and economic outlook we expect to keep expenses broadly stable in the second quarter with positive operating leverage and efficiency improving we expect stable to slightly higher provision reflecting loan growth with relatively stable net chargeoff levels and finally we expect to manage our cet ratio to around  and we will manage the average ldr to around  to  with regard to the full year  outlook we broadly reaffirm on the balance sheet and expense guidance that we previously provided but expect to come in at or above the high end of the range for nii and operating leverage to sum up on slide  our strong results this quarter demonstrated our ability to continue to improve how we run the bank we have delivered well against our strategic initiatives that help us drive underlying revenue growth and carefully manage our expense base we remain committed to being prudent capital allocators and enhancing our returns for shareholders in the second half of the year we will continue to focus on execution and making further progress for all stake holders with that let me turn it back to bruce bruce van saun thanks john before we start the qa let me turn it over to brad for some brief words on a media article on our checkup program brad brad conner thanks bruce we have confidence in the checkup program as an important part of our strategy to serve customers well and ultimately be better positioned to deepen relationships we believe its important to note that recent media coverage did not suggest customer harm nor have we identified any nevertheless we have commenced a through review to determine whether there are any issues in the delivery of the program my current expectation is that we are in a good position based on feedback and survey results we already have our surveys show that customers who go through the review are highly satisfied and most would recommend a checkup to someone else an engagement and organizational health index at our braches is up customer alignment is up and the indiscernible is down since we moved to this mode of interaction that our branch based customers however were open to things we learn from review that we can adjust to become even better so back to you bruce bruce van saun okay thanks brad and with that operator were ready to open it up for qa questionandanswer session operator thank mr van saun operator instructions and our first question will come from john pancari with evercore please go ahead john pancari good morning bruce van saun hi john pancari could you update us on your – your updated thoughts on the rotc expectation at this point i know you had a target of  medium term youre certainly close to that now so can you talk about where you expect that could go over the course of the next year and how soon you could be up towards your original targets when you spun off thanks bruce van saun john i have repeatedly not want to be drawn in on putting a pin in the exact timing that we get to the  what i would say is that weve made nice progress kind of consistently last year and now in the first quarter and we are getting closer a lot will depend on first the environment and continued movement in the interest rates which provide some tailwind and then our continued ability to execute on our strategic initiatives so i think we have momentum i think we’re as you say getting relatively close so hopefully it wont be too long but what i would ultimately say is that once we get to that  we wont be satisfied we will look out we will be doing our strategic planning effort this summer and well consider whether at the appropriate time it is appropriate to raise that target even higher john pancari okay all right thanks and then separately or just around the auto business i know you indicated outside of the of the scusa purchases ending that you are shrinking that that portfolio so if you can talk about the rationale behind it and the magnitude of the shrinking we could expect and then separately any update on credit there is that influencing that decision bruce van saun now its really john you can add to what i say or brad but i think that the real reason is that we grew the auto book when there wasnt much happening on the consumer side so there side so there was very little demand for credit from consumers except in the auto arena so we ramped up our own self originations and we supplemented that with the scusa flow agreement which got us into the prime space in the super prime space and delivering quite returns our view is always that the runoff in auto was a bridge to hold us and deploy some capital until ultimately the consumer can back and if you will got hisher mojo back and so weve seen that now weve seen increase in demand for personal unsecured and revolving credit student lending mortgages and so as those other portfolios grow theres less need to have the auto and frankly the auto now that our returns have lifted is dilutive to our overall rotce and overall returns so i think youll see us we probably peaked at maybe  billion in total loan balance i think that will probably be lower by about  billion and i would expect that trend to continue into next year i do know john or brad john woods the only thing i would add in the specific question around in any way related to credit performance the answer is no our credit performance has been strong right in line with our pricing expectation and our expectation is to your point its all about the return on the business its not in any way related to the credit performance bruce van saun okay anything from you brad conner yes just getting back to the point about reallocating that capital to hire a better use i may have mentioned in my remarks that this generates higher riskadjusted returns for us when we rotate that capital into those other consumer businesses so were excited about that bruce van saun yes john pancari okay great thank you operator and our next question will come from david eads with ubs please go ahead david eads hi good morning and welcome john maybe starting with you i think when you talked about kind of the strategic priorities you started with opportunities for to optimize and improve on the funding side see if you can kind of drill into more detail of where you think opportunities might be there whether it is on the consumer side or the commercial side – how you think that’s going end what opportunities are going to be shaking out given the changes to the dynamics for deposit given higher rates john woods yes thanks and i think ive just talked about it on both sides and partnering with don and brad on this in early days theres been nice momentum in both of those businesses on funding id say that were entering into an environment here which well all talk about rising rates and how we all operate in that environment but looking forward when you look at overall balance sheet were looking to remix and as we just talked about on the asset side and better use of that capital were constantly looking for better ways to fund that portfolio and thats part of our franchise and we have some momentum there in terms of getting the right mix of commercial and consumer so i think youll see a bit more on the commercial side and getting a better representation of commercial deposits in our footprint and theres also – weve seen good control of deposit cost in the consumer side so like everybody were going to constantly look at that and look for ways to better fund the balance sheet bruce van saun brad we want to add some of the initiatives may be that you have going on in consumer targeting of that segmentation of the customer base mining products and having data analytics to really tease out the products from with good offers to different segments of the base brad conner yes you bet a couple of things weve got i think we talked about this a little bit on last quarters call we have redesigned our value proposition for our massive and affluent consumers i think you’d get a much better value proposition to serve the needs of those customers and then we invested very heavily in analytics and really understanding our customer segments and how to reach them with very specific and targeted offers so that our offers are much less about putting broad offers out if you will across the entire branch base that’s targeting the specific customers and specific customers sets and we think that will really allow us to be much more efficient in driving lowercost deposits bruce van saun yes and brad youre also looking to focus on where the opportunities are for deposits brad conner yes i mean i think we’ve got materially more sophisticated in our deposit strategies over the last couple of quarters and added staff and added specific programs and added industry base focus to where we work with those deposits that are attractive and attractively priced so we’re very confident there bruce van saun and we will start to emphasize some of the industry segments that have that are cash rich as supposed to on a credit needy i think its part of the rotation that were looking at as well brad conner correct david eads great thanks guys that’s very helpful and may be second question obviously a really good quarter on the fee side you talked about may be a little bit of pullback on the capital markets im curious is the equitation that this step up in the card fee line should be sustainable and kind of a may be fluctuating but broadly sustainable at this higher level bruce van saun yes let me take that and then i’ll ask my partners to color but first off with respect to capital markets it really was an exceptionally strong quarter and i think it really shows that we built some great capabilities we had to move off of being a partner with rbs for many of these products and weve now stood them up on our own weve got really good teamwork going between coverage bankers and our product specialists and were making great traction and the market conditions were very favorable and i think we hit the ball out of the park i think what were cautioning is that we were at record levels when the capital markets fees were in the mids very recently we just hit a  i still think the numbers this year the outlook is strong but its kind of capturing lightning in the bottle at this point for  but like i used to kid with don and his team when we were in the s s the new  and then we were in the s s the new  so i think we will continue to see as we built up our book of customers and continue to expand our capabilities that will push that number at over time on the card side what i would say is that look the renegotiations that we had with our core processing vendors creates a sustainable lift there was some of rewards expense adjustment in the quarter which would not repeat but that will be partially offset by seasonality in q so i think well see a good percentage of this lift stick but not all so don i don’t know if you want to add any color don mccree no i think you’re exactly right on capital markets i mean the only thing id add is it is incredibly competitive out there right now and aggressive so were trying to maintain a level of discipline on the transactions we do highly encouraged by the quality of the franchise and the transactions that we are doing were winning in disproportionate share of what were seeing so as you said it is the function of activity in the market discipline and then quality of franchise i think we will continue to have strong quarters going forward our treasury services business just to mention that my other fee line has got tremendous momentum and its really led by card which is growing at  to  a year so thats the way for the future in terms of our treasury business so on both … bruce van saun yes don mccree really nothing to add bruce i think you said it right bruce van saun okay david eads great thanks so much bruce van saun thanks eads operator and our next question will come from matt burnell with wells fargo securities please go ahead matt burnell good morning thanks for taking my question maybe just focusing for a minute on commercial lending what are the trends youre seeing there in terms of demand by size or maybe industry verticals a couple of your competitors over the last few days have mentioned a growing demand in midmarket and maybe below midmarket relative to where its been the last few quarters can you give us a little more color in terms of those trends and the utilization rates bruce van saun don you want to take that don mccree id say utilization just to start with that its up slightly not in a material way so were seeing pretty standard utilization our pipelines in our midmarket business are actually quite strong and the question is what closes and when does it close and how does the demand continue to materialize we saw quite robust kind of conversations in demands early early in the year off the back of the changes in administration and i would say given some of the uncertainty of delivery of some of those programs and potential delay into the back end of the year its moderated a little bit but were encouraged by what were seeing in terms of pipeline growth and activity in conversations i will say that its been offset by two other factors one is there has been very tremendous capital markets activity and in our midcorporate and some of our industry vertical businesses weve seen a lot of refinancings into the capital markets given the strength of the capital markets you can see that in our fee lines as we capture some of that opportunity and at the margin weve got more disciplined on returns so we are turning certain parts of the book to try to build better returning portfolios so weve seen shrink in places like our leasing business which has been offset by growth in other parts of our business so i guess id summarize it by saying client activity is strong we think the franchise is strong were adding a lot of new clients so were optimistic as we look out through the next several quarters whether it materializes in the second quarter or third quarter is the timing question gets in the back of my mind matt burnell okay and just staying on the idea of commercial you’ve mentioned a couple of times so far this call about growing commercial deposits prudently and im curious john if you think that thats going to add to pressure in terms of deposit beta over your relative to what your prior expectations have been john woods i think we are going to talk a little bit about how those funds are being deployed as well you have heard a little bit earlier were putting that money to good use were making prudent decisions on the pricing side and we have – were doing better on the loan yield side so youve got to look at those sides of the balance sheet there when you talk about what were doing with those funds sure commercial deposits have bit higher beta than a consumer deposits but as you heard earlier from don we are underpenetrated on that side weve got some very interesting things going on in the products front that will help to create some momentum on raising commercial deposits and we feel good about where that will go in terms of from a mix standpoint and how we will put that capital and liquidity to work matt burnell thank you operator and our next question will come from matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead ricky dodds hey guys this is actually ricky dodds from matts team just a quick question on the buildout and wealth in mortgage it seems to be going pretty well and appreciate the update and the press release just wondering if you could give a little more color on sort of whats left to do there and how you think you guys are doing on the build versus maybe your initial expectations thanks bruce van saun brad you want to take that brad conner sure i would say were feeling pretty good about both of those areas i will start with mortgage we were up  this quarter up  yearonyear i think the key for us has been we feel really good about the progress were making in turning our operations around so weve really seen improvement in our customer satisfaction operations which has allowed us to recruit loan officers and retain loan officers obviously the entire industry is seeing a little bit of slowdown in terms of demand but all in all we feel good and the progress that were making with hiring our loan officers have been in our conforming geographies as well which will help drive fee income so we feel very good about that id say on the wealth side good quarter for us and we feel good about the progress were making we continue to see improved growth we talked about it last quarter one of the things that slowed our trajectory a little bit in growing fee income was a movement from to more managed money feebased products and were seeing that trend continue but we feel like weve sort of crossed over that threshold where not yet that sustainable source of fee income and so continuing to have good success and good progress and i would say yes maybe to your question about how do we feel against our original projection we feel like were pretty much on track there guys john woods well id say its probably taken us longer… brad conner taken us longer john woods …to get here but we have made some id say slight adjustments in the mortgages to make sure we are focusing on the conforming geographies to make sure we get fulfillment on servicing where it needs to be and in wealth i think were just building it the right way putting the right products in place were putting the right customer segmentation and delivery mechanisms in place weve got the robo advisory now up and running this quarter and so i am really excited about really where both businesses are today and the outlook although id say to be fair its taken us a little longer to get there ricky dodds okay great thanks and just a quick one on occupancy cost this quarter it looks like you called out about  million and branch rationalization or upgrade cost wondering if you can give a little color on that and then is that something we should expect going forward as you continue to sort of make improvements to your footprint bruce van saun yes theres probably of that increase i think it was maybe  or  was related to the branch charges but what were focused on here is what we call refer to as branch transformation which is to take a look at all our branches and try to figure out how to reconfigure them so in most instances we dont need as much space as we have so we want to reduce the overall square footage in the branches and we want to take what was space dedicated to transactions and the remaining space should have more private rooms for conversation so we can deliver advice to our customers and we can also use the foyer  the entrance room for putting in some very sophisticated machines that people can do a lot of the banking that require tellers right on those machines were probably looking at a year timeline based on our lease expiries to get to all our branches and were kind of in the early stages of that so initially youll see the charges for the refurbs exceed what we get in terms of the back book of lower rent from the restructured branches but as time goes by that becomes a nice driver because ultimately well be driving the occupancy expense lower and because of the less square footage and that will swamp the cost of a handful of branches each quarter getting refurbished so anyway thats what you saw in q ricky dodds okay thank you operator operator instructions and well go to the line of vivek juneja with jp morgan vivek juneja hi bruce hi john bruce van saun hi vivek vivek juneja i wanted to talk a little bit about reserves reserve levels for your loan portfolio obviously crisp and very good but how youre thinking about reserves to loans have come down a little further to  and where do you see that leveling out john woods look were comfortable with where that is vivek and i think it partly reflects the shift in some of the portfolio that youve seen youve seen someone runoff of – some of the legacy poor assets that service by other home equity portfolio being replaced with very high prime and super prime consumer assets which has been an upgrade and i think in the commercial side youre seeing growth in the kind of midcorporate space which tend to be higher rated credit so i think its really just overall function of the decisions were making in terms of how we plan where we play if you look at the coverage ratios of things like npls that continues to go up and i think were up to  on that basis so overall i think were probably getting to a point where you wont see significant further reductions from that  but hopefully if we keep working down the book of npls you might see that number continue to improve somewhat the other thing id say thats quite interesting is while we’re focused on getting higher yields and were also improving the riskadjusted returns on our loan book were seeing that our stress test losses are actually reducing because of some of the impacts that i described thats running off these legacy portfolios and putting really good quality back on the book so you kind of have the hatch wrecking effects better yields better risk adjusted returns and lower stress losses which is really great to see vivek juneja okay great you basically indiscernible into my next question which was ccar can you talk a little bit about how youre thinking about that and given your continued very strong capital levels your plans for how youre thinking about capital return and capital deployment bruce van saun sure and again weve been i think very consistent and predictable that weve been on a glide path that we want to have strong returns of capital to shareholders and strong loan growth the fact that we were birth from rbs with a high capital ratio has allowed us that flexibility were coming closer and closer to where peers are but we still have i think relatively high rates i think you could expect more of the same in terms of our approach this year when i think about what we want to do with capital certainly increasing the dividend you saw us raise the dividend and the payout ratio is going up wed like that to continue and well also want to continue to fund loan growth as a high priority and then when we have excess well use that to repurchase the shares so thats it in a nutshell vivek juneja and are you still targeting bruce as you look out what kind of target capital ratios rather than me putting words in your mouth let me just give that too what are you thinking where you would like to run with that bruce van saun well we havent really freshened that view as you recall when we did the ipo roadshow we said we wanted to bring it down to around  i think last year we came from  to ish so the glide path in the past couple of years has been down  basis points or so i think it’ll cross over  this year and still have a differential to peers so i think this continued glide path can continue not only this year but into next year and so well stay tuned on that well probably post you on that sometime in the middle of the year vivek juneja thanks bruce bruce van saun okay operator and our next question will come from scott valentin with compass point please go ahead scott valentin good morning thanks for taking my question just on the unsecured portion of loan origination just wondering i know you guys used combination of partnerships and i guess internal initiatives just wondering over time if you plan to internalize all of that will partnerships remain a key component into driving that unsecured loan growth consumer loan growth bruce van saun let me start and brad can add some color on this but clearly weve had – i think weve taken the view that to grow our card portfolio is challenging because the payback period for actually growing that book takes some time and so there were better uses of expense dollars to grow other portfolios one of the things when we looked at the unsecured space and struck up the partnership with apple was that the returns are accretive much faster so we were able to make an investment to build the capabilities to support apple but then as the balances come on the books were not paying for zero balance transfers and heavy marketing expenses so we like that aspect about the program and the riskadjusted returns on that portfolio are very good from our standpoint we have – because of that being partnered with an iconic company like apple weve had other reverse inquiries and weve actually gone out and solicited some so weve got two new partnerships set up that will gain some traction as the year goes by one is with vivint a smart alarm company and the other is with hp and stay tuned because there could be more in the works so we like that capability that we have developed and partnering with real class companies and so that i think will be a growth feature going forward weve also determined that there is an opportunity much in the way with add refi lending products that we can offer attractive propositions to borrowers who are carrying highcost debt there is other customers of ours who maybe carrying multiple revolving credit balances who can consolidate that into an unsecured line of credit and so we introduced our pearl product last year and that has real traction too so i think youll probably see a combination of it too you will see some direct mailing and branch offers to our customers on the pearl product and then married to an overall trust on the partnership side so brad you want to add to that brad conner indiscernible i think you said it right i mean we have a very high quality list of other potential partners that have reached out to us i think we have new capability and we think we can continue to expand with a very attractive set of customers i’d just point out to that vivint is a very good commercial bank customer of don and i think it’s also related to build rate synergy between the consumer and the commercial bank and we will continue to look at those opportunities as well bruce van saun great scott valentin thanks very much bruce van saun okay operator and there are no further questions in queue at this time ill turn it back over to mr van saun for closing remarks bruce van saun okay well thanks again everyone for dialing in today we really appreciate your interest as i said in the press release i think were really firing well on all cylinders i remain very confident in our fullyear outlook thanks again and have a good day operator and that concludes todays conference call

drove the british government to take control of the bank in a  billion taxpayer bailout his job help turn around the bankas the economy and the bank’s finances stabilized the british government

executive in  pat rohan a managing director of finpro inc a bank consultant in new jersey said van saun’s plan to increase mortgage lending and move into riskier but potentially more profitable segments of auto lending is a sound approach to boosting returnsbut banking is not just about offering the right products analysts said bankers also must build relationships where they operate so consumers and businesses think of them when they want to borrow or invest“the success for any bank to grow is to establish ties to the communities” rohan said “that requires boots on the ground”before

boston symphony and were on annual lists of the city’s power playersbut boston banker lawrence fish who had built the bank into a regional presence and was at one point paid more than his boss in the

communities he still lives with his wife in new jersey but works out of the bank’s main offices in providence and stamford connvan saun said citizens’ success will ultimately be about execution and he
