graduating his earliest work published pseudonymously in the s was mostly in the softporn mass market paperback industry an apprenticeship he shared with fellow mystery author donald e westlake block describes the early sex novels as a valuable experience noting that despite the titillating content of the books rather mild by later standards of adult fiction he was expected to write fully developed novels with plausible plots characters and conflicts he further credits the softcore novels as a factor in his prolific output writing  to  sex novels per year to support himself financially block was forced to learn to write in a manner that required little revision and editing of his first drafts his first novel was a lesbian fiction titled strange are the ways of love written under the name lesley evans in  block reissued this novel with a new title shadows under another of his pseudonyms jill emerson the first of his work to appear under his own name was the  story you cant lose for the crimeadventure magazine manhunt he has since published more than fifty novels and more than a hundred short stories as well as a series of books for writers block has lived in new york city for decades setting most of his fiction there and has come to be very closely associated with the city he is married to lynne block he has three daughters amy reichel jill block and alison pouliot from an earlier marriage with lynne he spends much of his time traveling the two have been to  countries but continues to consider new york his home he was a regular guest on the late late show with craig ferguson  appearing in eight of fergusons ten seasons as host of the program considerable autobiographical information on the earlier phase of his life and career may be found scattered through telling lies for fun and profit  a collection of his fiction columns from writers digest in  he was honored with the gumshoe lifetime achievement award block is an alumnus of the ragdale foundation matthew scudderedit main article matthew scudder blocks most famous creation the everevolving matthew scudder was introduced in s the sins of the fathers as an alcoholic excop working as an unlicensed private investigator in hells kitchen originally published as paperbacks the early novels are interchangeable the second and third entries—in the midst of death  and time to murder and create —were written in the opposite order s  million ways to die filmed in  by hal ashby with unpopular results breaks from that trend concluding with scudder introducing himself at an alcoholics anonymous meeting the series was set to end on that note but an idle promise block had made to supply an editor friend with an original scudder short resulted in by the dawns early light a story set during the characters drinking days but told from the perspective of a recovering alcoholic block expanded on that with s when the sacred ginmill closes named for a line in a song by folk singer dave van ronk a close friend which proved not only one of the more literary entries but also a favorite of the author and his fans from then on scudders circumstances rarely remain the same from one book to the next s a ticket to the boneyard for example reunites him with elaine mardell a hooker from his days on the force whom he marries several books later other fan favorites are s taut gruesome a dance at the slaughterhouse winner of the edgar award for best mystery novel and s a long line of dead men a tightly plotted puzzler featuring a rapidly dwindling fraternity known as the club of  a walk among the tombstones published in  was made into a film released in  written and directed by scott frank with liam neeson playing the lead role the seventeenth entry a drop of the hard stuff was published in may  it has been suggested that scudders struggle with alcoholism is in part autobiographical while block has repeatedly refused to discuss the subject citing aas own tradition of anonymity in a column he wrote for writers digest block wrote that when he created scudder i let him hang out in the same saloon where i spent a great deal of my own time i was drinking pretty heavily around that time and i made him a pretty heavy drinker too i drank whiskey sometimes mixing it with coffee so did scudder bernie rhodenbarredit main article bernie rhodenbarr blocks other major series humorous and much lighter in tone relates the misadventures of gentleman burglar bernie rhodenbarr the series is rich in sophisticated witty dialogue unlike scudder rhodenbarr is ageless remaining essentially the same from s burglars cant be choosers to the eleventh and most recent entry s the burglar who counted the spoons the only significant advancements come in the third volume the burglar who liked to quote kipling  winner of the first annual nero award which sees bernie having used the spoils from his previous caper to buy a bookstore and introduces carolyn kaiser his lesbian soulmate and partner in crime the plots run very much to form bernie breaks into a residence usually on manhattans upper east side and through a series of implausible events becomes involved in a murder investigation—often as the prime suspect not even an elevenyear hiatus between s the burglar who painted like mondrian and s the burglar who traded ted williams would see that basic formula change there is however a meta quality to the more recent entries bernie the reluctant detective is himself a bookseller and genre fan and is apt to make references to agatha christie ew hornung his cat is named raffles dashiell hammett raymond chandler sue grafton and john sandford among others the burglar who thought he was bogart  exploits this to full effect set during a humphrey bogart film festival the story is itself inspired by many of the actors most famous roles the burglar in the library  similarly imagines a meeting between hammet and chandler at a new england inn in the s casting a volume inscribed by chandler to hammett as its own maltese falcon in the burglar in the rye bernie helps track down a writer clearly based on jd salinger the second novel the burglar in the closet was filmed in  as burglar with whoopi goldberg as bernie or bernice evan michael tanneredit main article evan michael tanner besides scudder and rhodenbarr block has written eight novels about evan tanner an adventurer and accidental revolutionary who as a result of an injury sustained in the korean war cannot sleep all but the last of these were published in the s and early s beginning with s the thief who couldnt sleep while the most recent s tanner on ice revived the character after nearly a thirtyyear hiatus chip harrisonedit chip harrison running on the twin engines of lust and curiosity originally appeared in two funny nonmystery novels which revolved around seventeenyearold chips obsessive quest to lose his virginity no score and chip harrison scores again realizing the

kelleredit four episodic novels hit man  hit list  hit parade  and hit me  as well as one fulllength novel hit and run  chronicle the life of keller a lonely wistful hitman who originally appeared as a semiregular feature in playboy magazine in the s most of the novels are fixups of related short stories hit and run is the only keller novel conceived of and written as a single story kellers full name is john paul keller a fact mentioned in hit man although he is rarely called anything but keller in the series the stories are rarely actionoriented or focused on the details of his crimes instead being character studies of kellers personality and the people he meets eg kellers being hired to kill a major league baseball designated hitter but postponing the act and following the team to away games so the hitter can reach the career milestone of  home runs originally based in new york city he later relocates to new orleans where he lives under the name nicholas edwards keller receives

describes the early sex novels as a valuable experience noting that despite the titillating content of the books rather mild by later standards of adult fiction he was expected to write fully developed novels with plausible plots characters and conflicts he further credits the softcore novels as a factor in his prolific output writing  to  sex novels per year to support himself financially block was forced to learn to write in a manner that required little revision and editing of his first drafts his first novel was a lesbian fiction titled strange are the ways of love written under the name lesley evans in  block reissued this novel with a new title shadows under another of his pseudonyms jill emerson the first of his work to appear under his own name was the  story you cant lose

matthew scudderedit main article matthew scudder blocks most famous creation the everevolving matthew scudder was introduced in s the sins of the fathers as an alcoholic excop working as an unlicensed private investigator in hells kitchen originally published as paperbacks the early novels are interchangeable the second and third entries—in the midst of death  and time to murder and create —were written in the opposite order s  million ways to die filmed in  by hal ashby with unpopular results breaks from that trend concluding with scudder introducing himself at an alcoholics anonymous meeting the series was set to end on that note but an idle promise block had made to supply an editor friend with an original scudder short resulted in by the dawns early light a story set during the characters drinking days but told from the perspective of a recovering alcoholic block expanded on that with s when the sacred ginmill closes named for a line in a song by folk singer dave van ronk a close friend which proved not only one of the more literary entries but also a favorite of the author and his fans from then on scudders circumstances rarely remain the same from one book to the next s a ticket to the boneyard for example reunites him with elaine mardell a hooker from his days on the force whom he marries several books later other fan favorites are s taut gruesome a dance at the slaughterhouse winner of the edgar award for best mystery novel and s a long line of dead men a tightly plotted puzzler featuring a rapidly dwindling fraternity known as the club of  a walk among the tombstones published in  was made into a film released in  written and directed by scott frank with liam neeson playing the lead role the seventeenth entry a drop of the hard stuff was published in may  it has been suggested that scudders struggle with alcoholism is in part autobiographical while block has repeatedly refused to discuss the subject citing aas own tradition of anonymity in a column he wrote for writers digest block wrote that when he created scudder i let him hang out in the same saloon where i spent a great deal of my own time i was drinking pretty heavily around that time and i made him a pretty heavy drinker too i drank whiskey sometimes mixing it with coffee so did scudder bernie rhodenbarredit main article bernie rhodenbarr blocks other major series humorous and much lighter in tone relates the misadventures of gentleman burglar bernie rhodenbarr the series is rich in sophisticated witty dialogue unlike scudder rhodenbarr is ageless remaining essentially the same from s burglars cant be choosers to the eleventh and most recent entry s the burglar who counted the spoons the only significant advancements come in the third volume the burglar who liked to quote kipling  winner of the first annual nero award which sees bernie having used the spoils from his previous caper to buy a bookstore and introduces carolyn kaiser his lesbian soulmate and partner in crime the plots run very much to form bernie breaks into a residence usually on manhattans upper east side and through a series of implausible events becomes involved in a murder investigation—often as the prime suspect not even an elevenyear hiatus between s the burglar who painted like mondrian and s the burglar who traded ted williams would see that basic formula change there is however a meta quality to the more recent entries bernie the reluctant detective is himself a bookseller and genre fan and is apt to make references to agatha christie ew hornung his cat is named raffles dashiell hammett raymond chandler sue grafton and john sandford among others the burglar who thought he was bogart  exploits this to full effect set during a humphrey bogart film festival the story is itself inspired by many of the actors most famous roles the burglar in the library  similarly imagines a meeting between hammet and chandler at a new england inn in the s casting a volume inscribed by chandler to hammett as its own maltese falcon in the burglar in the rye bernie helps track down a writer clearly based on jd salinger the second novel the burglar in the closet

kelleredit four episodic novels hit man  hit list  hit parade  and hit me  as well as one fulllength novel hit and run  chronicle the life of keller a lonely wistful hitman who originally appeared as

name is john paul keller a fact mentioned in hit man although he is rarely called anything but keller in the series the stories are rarely actionoriented or focused on the details of his crimes instead being character studies of kellers personality and the people he meets eg kellers being hired to kill a major league baseball designated hitter but postponing the act and following the team to away games so the hitter can reach the career milestone of  home runs originally based in new york city he later relocates to new orleans where he lives under the name nicholas edwards keller receives
