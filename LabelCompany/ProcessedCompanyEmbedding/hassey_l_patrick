patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer thanks dan and thanks to everyone for joining us today with all thats been going on in the equity markets lately this is not a time to be pessimistic its really not a time to be optimistic rather its a time to be realistic about the long term intermediate and short term during this call well try to separate the fears in the equity and credit markets from the fundamentals and the drivers of atis business we see plusses and minuses mostly we see plusses for ati so lets start with the facts of  firstly we strengthened our position in key global markets launched new production facilities and solidified our balance sheet we achieved record sales and profits demand continued to be strong from our key diversified global markets aerospace and defense chemical process industry oil and gas electrical energy and medical these markets accounted for  of atis sales in  direct international sales increased  and reached a record of nearly  billion or approximately  of total sales we believe that nearly one half of atis sales are driven by global markets when we consider exports of our customers we continue to build on our foundation of unsurpassed manufacturing capabilities our major capital projects for titanium sponge production melting rolling and finishing are on track our titanium sponge production reached  million pounds annualized in  we also launched new titanium and nickelbased alloy melting assets including new vars and our new pam iii plasma arc melting furnace we remained focused on our performance and execution resulting in gross cost reductions totaling  million exceeding our  gross cost reduction target of  million finally in a very weak stainless market our flatrolled products segment set a record for profitability over  million of segment operating profit for the year cash flow was strong in  cash on hand at the end of the year was  million this is after investing  million in capital expenditures including  million for our strategic capital projects we repurchased  shares of stock for approximately  million our share repurchase program only began on november th of last year we made a  million voluntary pension contribution we have voluntarily contributed  million to our us qualified defined benefit pension plan since  the plan was approximately  funded at the end of the year as a result in  we expect retirement benefit expenses to be only  million as compared to  million in  the key financial metrics for the year were impressive stockholders equity is  billion giving us the strongest balance sheet in the companys history return on stockholders equity was  return on capital employed was  and we had more cash than debt at the end of the year  may be remembered as a year of extreme raw material cost volatility and extraordinary inventory destocking by some distributor customers titanium scrap prices began the year at  per pound and fell to  per pound at the end of the year and i am referring to  premium solid scrap which is the scrap that we buy average lme nickel cash price in december  was  per pound the nickel price peaked in may at  a pound and then it fell to  a pound in december of  this volatility resulted in never before seen customer buying patterns lastly we completed a number of new longterm agreements in the third and fourth quarters of last year we expect total revenue from these agreements to be approximately  billion during the timeframe of the agreements these agreements generally range from two years to five years these ltas cover our titanium and titanium alloy nickelbased alloy specialty alloy grainoriented electrical silicon steel and iron castings ltas indicate that longterm supply of these products remain critically important to our customers we are working on significant ltas for these and other projects as we report here in the first quarter now looking ahead to  and beyond we believe ati is well positioned to benefit from diversified global markets in  and over the next several years the longterm position of ati and the fundamentals of our markets are outstanding were optimistic about  our shortterm view the first quarter is choppy so why do we feel this way lets start with the aerospace and defense markets and continue from there we see shortterm headwinds as a result of potential delays in the boeing  delivery schedule remember the new schedule is not precisely available its not a matter of if we will see strong demand from this revolutionary new plane its a matter of when and how strongly ati benefits from this model as well as future composite titanium airplanes we are pleased with our growing relationship with the boeing company it is a growing relationship in titanium and valueadded titanium products it is also a growing relationship in specialty alloys as well as cutting tools the products we supply boeing can be used and are used on all boeing airplane models the commercial airplane market is very strong boeing booked  net orders in  airbus booked  net orders last year both have record backlogs some analysts in the field say its a sixyear backlog some say its an eightyear backlog either way both companies are boosting production demand is also strong from the regional jet manufacturers next each of these planes has two to four engines hanging on their wings our customers like ge aviation cfm international rollsroyce announced record and strong orders in  bottom line we expect all of this to translate into strong demand for our specialty metals for many years by the way strong demand from global markets and extended backlogs are happening while the us fleet continues to age with few new airplanes on order this is really another insurance policy if you will to continuing high build rates well into the future now focusing on our titanium growth we have new production facilities that are scheduled to be launched in  these facilities build on our foundation of unsurpassed manufacturing capabilities that give ati the most advanced technology in our industry this gives us the capability to manufacture the most advanced specialty metals for the next generation and future generation airframes and jet engines in addition the lowest cost titanium units that we can get from a reliable and qualified sourced are manufactured at our own albany oregon facility in  we expect further growth in our titanium mill product shipments we believe demand will continue to remain at a high level from the aerospace and defense market for our high performance metals segment titanium products we expect titanium average selling prices in this segment to be at a lower level than in  but this is primarily due to lower raw material prices and our surcharging indexes demand is so strong for our flatrolled commercial titanium products from the global industrial markets including the chemical process industry and the oil and gas industry sometimes titanium sales in our flatrolled products have been or are overlooked in  shipments of titanium products from this segment and atiproduced uniti titanium products grew nearly  to approximately  million pounds with ltas we have in hand today which we did not have in hand in  we expect to exceed this shipment level in  atis total shipments of titanium products from our high performance metals and flatrolled products segments including conversion of our uniti titanium joint venture totaled over  million pounds in  we expect this total of titanium shipments to grow to approximately  million pounds in  now lets discuss the flexibility of our unsurpassed and fungible manufacturing capabilities i like to use the word fungible as a multimetals producer with global sales teams we have the ability to find and supply growth markets in some cases these are applications that are new to us in this case our ati asia and uniti joint venture sales teams captured orders with a strong demand for titanium sheet used in plate frame and tubular heating heat exchangers we take some of our new titanium sponge some of our titanium melt capabilities along with some raw material and semifinished products from our uniti joint venture partner and make high quality titanium sheets we expect shipments into this market to be strong under multiyear ltas that begin in  moving to our exotic metals division demand is so strong from the nuclear electrical energy market and the global chemical process industry that we are now booking orders into  we restarted our idle zirconium sponge capacity in  some of it and plan to add more zirconium sponge capacity in  to meet this growing demand our nonnuclear grade zirconium products are used in processing plants that produce chemicals used in making plastics and fertilizers now moving to another strong product demand remains very strong for our grainoriented silicon electrical steel products overall based on the ltas that we have with several customers we expect shipments and prices to be up in  while there is some softness in the us market due to the housing slowdown global demand remained strong from the electrical energy distribution market also interest in our premium light gauge products is robust as the us prepares for new efficiency requirements mandated recently by the doe now turning to the short term for the first quarter we do see some choppiness our caution comes from questions about the health of the us economy and the nearterm aerospace supply chain at this point we must separate these fundamentals from fear from our viewpoint we do not have a negative outlook for the us economy demand for our standard grade stainless sheet products in our flatrolled products segment is improving after s inventory destocking it appears that us service centers now have their inventories in better balance recovery in our stainless sheet business seems to be occurring in the us and in europe january and february production schedules have filled and we are now loading for march in our high performance metals segment demand from our oem aerospace customers particularly those under longterm agreement is expected to remain at high level at a high level in  as airframe and jet engine backlogs are at record levels approximately  of our business here is under ltas some are take or pay some are guaranteed share and some are market requirement contracts on the other hand our transaction or spot business there is some risk in the first quarter as our nonoem and service center customers are being cautious largely due to questions about the  schedule the us economy and volatility in raw materials in summary we remain optimistic about  we expect to continue to benefit from the global infrastructure build and rebuild we expect aerospace and defense demand to remain at a high level we expect demand from our commercial aerospace to increase once the uncertainties surrounding the  schedule and supplicant ph ramp up are removed our flatrolled products standard sheet business seems to be recovering inventory at distributors is relatively low atis strategic capital projects are on track and we expect another year of strong cash flow at this point we believe the first quarter  results are likely likely to be similar to those achieved in the fourth quarter  however we expect to have a better understanding of the potential upside for the balance of  once we get beyond this first quarter with that said operator we will now open up the meeting for questions question and answer operator thank you operator instructions and your first question comes from the line of chris olin from cleveland research please proceed chris olin  cleveland research good afternoon unidentified company representative hi chris chris olin  cleveland research i want to get some clarity on the titanium market here i guess i am going to focus on the supply side what is your total exposure to the cp titanium market i guess im wondering how much exposure these operations will have once you start to see the asian capacity boom and im wondering if thats having any kind of impact on your business in terms of too much supply coming on the marketplace l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer good question let me just tell you whats happening as i mentioned in my previous comments our assets and our capacities are fungible so we have may be an announcement to make that will be very interesting to people on this call we are the largest supplier of cp quality sheet in the world our flatrolled products division is the largest supplier of cp quality sheet in the world we shipped last year as i mentioned  million pounds out of this unit and we expect that business to be further strengthened this year in new markets called plate frame heat exchanger and tubing that goes into power generators and exchangers that go into the nuclear chemical processing business and other markets so when we look at that market today were seeing a growing presence of ati in those markets the demand is very high and its interesting to me that if there is so much capacity coming online why we didnt have a problem booking ltas for two or three years out in these markets chris olin  cleveland research okay thanks operator your next question comes from the line of john hill with citi john hill  smith barney citigroup great thanks for the presentation everyone i was just wondering if we could walk through the new ltas that were signed in the quarter we seemed to mention a fair number of those on the call was everything from high performance metals to exotics et cetera in some new geographies so could you just give us some illustrative examples of new deals that were signed up in the quarter l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer well give you some range of the market john im not sure i want to mention customers at this point in time but basically were talking about the electrical steel business we knew that as the us market was coming into some problems that it would be good to have contracts in place we also have a capability in our business of producing the lighter gauges in this market which is products that produce a more efficient voltage regulation so as the household market single phase market went down we concentrated on those industrial applications and also the newer doe requirements in not only the us market but around the world we signed some contracts for supply of electrical steel that are new to us and maybe even some new accounts and we have signed those up at higher prices and higher shares so we like that we have some billet customers again for the aerospace business and defense market some forgers we have some contracts that went into the airframe business we have a new contract ill mention one with bombardier for some of their requirements other than that we go into some wind energy kind of contracts for the first time on hubs and stands we have as i mentioned some contracts in titanium commercial grade titanium for plateframe heat exchangers mostly for marine applications and weve got some precision rolled strip kind of contracts that weve put in place that are very attractive to us for such things as parts for turbo diesels for their turbocharger application so its been all over the map interesting part is that this hasnt ended as we ended the quarter were getting a lot of requests today we are in negotiations for contracts in several market segments of the company today so people but the point i was trying to make in the earlier one and ill say it again is that people as they look at the longer term and they look at when i say longer term talking three years kind of horizon continue to be worried about supply and about quality supply for their products as this market rolls forward john hill  smith barney citigroup thats great perspective i was just wondering if we can do a quick follow up very very mechanical for rich on the retirement expense tailwind i guess for  is that decline of  million in retirement benefit expense is that the whole number or should we also be including the pension line from down below which adds another  million or so richard j harshman  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer no thats all ph number john we talk about retirement benefit expense and that two pieces thats pension expense and actually in this case in  the pension expense will be an income and then its also retirement benefit expense under our opeb programs that will be an expense and the net amount is a  million expense this year in  versus a  million expense in  john hill  smith barney citigroup but the net benefit from  to  is the  richard j harshman  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes john hill  smith barney citigroup pulling both pieces together richard j harshman  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes john hill  smith barney citigroup thank you operator your next question comes from the line of gautam khanna from cowen and company unidentified analyst hello l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer hello unidentified analyst this is karan ph in from indiscernible research a couple of questions in this challenging quarter for you pat regarding your private plan ph a lot of your different plants are producing your steel what are your operational improvement initiatives in terms of lean manufacturing tpm six sigma and how do you see those initiatives benefiting the organization l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer well the basic initiatives run within our movement toward the toyota production system in what we call the ati business system and reliability maintenance has been a major move for us where we have more of a change in our organization a change in our approach to a reliability centered maintenance which works on the effectiveness as well as the uptime and yield of our production centers weve had some tremendous productivity improvements on the same equipment a good example i can give you is that i think the numbers today are that we are probably up  with existing equipment in our electrical steel business we are up in our melting furnaces down in the allvac operation so we continue to move on the premise that people connect the system that our workers are the experts in the manufacturing side of the business our process and engineers are experts in the process put all those people together put some capital behind them and working together we are producing some very nice results in productivity across the company unidentified analyst and a follow up to that question what metrics are you guys using to manage the manufacturing processes a lot of companies similar to yours are using like oe and rona how important are those types of metrics to you and as we go forward for the remainder of the year what do you see as the challenges to improve on throughput and costs within your plants l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer well we are looking at again another  million cost re program ph on the aggregate and we look at the metrics of yield we look at the metrics first of all from the quality side look at our yield we look at our returns we look at the effective oee measurements from the production but we are also looking at production bottlenecks where we debottleneck on the basis of a flow path rather than pc by pc so we have different looks around that we have a new union contract that was put in place and continues in place under the recently early signed agreement and we look to utilize our people better and we have areas where we are seeing some attrition planned attrition and the rest of the workforce stepping up to what we have in the more flexible work assignments so we look at productivity we look at yield we look at our operational excellence well just call it that and then we look at flow paths in terms of their total productivity and we have moved into practices that simplify flow paths that align products to a simplified direct flow path working on the bottleneck rather than the flexibility of moving those across the systems we found that to be very effective too operator your next question comes from the line of gautam khanna with cowen gautam khanna  cowen and company yes just for the record guys that was not me i dont know who that was l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer hi gautam gautam khanna  cowen and company no problem i guess one of the questions i have is you had very strong margins in the high performance segment this quarter yet titanium pricing asps were down shipments werent up that much sequentially sort of what should we expect heading into  in terms of high performance margins given the lower asps and what do you expect kind of the asps to shake out at on the titanium side l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer well we dont report exactly what our titanium margins are but as a segment  gautam khanna  cowen and company fair enough l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer we put it all together and i think we are seeing some shortterm volume issues as the  program gets reshuffled for the third time and so we are seeing that and we are also seeing from a spot market standpoint a pretty competitive market on that  of our volume that we booked our target remains to stay north of   or north in total in the high performance area we had a very good high shipping quarter in our exotic metals which had some impact but not a huge impact with some impact in the fourth quarter and we see those margins continuing to be very very strong we see our margins basically in our longterm agreements remain fairly stable and then we see more a competitive environment as the stability of supply at fairly high levels meets demand at least until the  program launches and ramps then i think well see some higher margins as those that other  of the business starts to get tighter than what it is today gautam khanna  cowen and company i guess what i was trying to get at it is despite those market conditions which you endured in the fourth quarter you still had very strong margins at high performance so to the extent that things dont get appreciably worse should we look at north of  as reasonable entering  or because there was a big lifo adjustment that you trued up in one quarter we should actually think if the true margins if you will in q as closer to the  ex the lifo impact and assuming that market conditions dont change much from q to q we should be modeling q probably closer to the  range l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer i think thats a good weve said   plus i dont know if we want to say more than that we had margins that were certainly we still had the problems of the higher cost material from a fifo standpoint and we did get relief on that with the lifo reserves coming back in so that quarter when you balance everything out i think is a pretty true quarter i think as we move into the fourth quarter what i had said earlier is that well see some margin pressure on the  of our business thats not under contract so that may push them down from the  to a lower number i dont think you should go higher than that but i would say that the  margins plus is what were targeting rich do you want to add anything to that richard j harshman  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer no i gautam i think that i think your point about the fourth quarter and the lifo impact especially in the high performance metals segment in the fourth quarter because it is a true up to year end there probably was more of a lifo benefit that more than offset the fifo margin compression there now when you look at especially in the titanium side the manufacturing process we have given the product mix is long and i think were still likely to see some fifo margin compression in q as we work through the higher cost raw material thats being matched up against a much lower index and we would not expect at this point that to be offset by any lifo benefit in q so i think its a combination of many things including in q our expectation at this point that volumes on the spot business side might be a little lower because of the ongoing caution in the supply chain because of the issues that pat talked about regarding  gautam khanna  cowen and company okay and so just to conclude on that point we basically have in q asps working against us we have a little bit lighter volume because there is softness in the spot market and you have you dont have the one quarter true up of the lifo adjustment relative to your expectations and so it would not be absurd to go to closer to  versus  l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer yes i would agree with that and then just add one other thing when we see a stronger flatrolled side gautam khanna  cowen and company right and thats the second part of the question and then ill kick it to other people but you had guided previously directionally  to  in flatrolled over time and we are at  in q kind of whats the shape of that recovery and do you get to  by q or when do we see that again l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer yes i think that the year was   for the total year and i think as we get to any kind of a normal level in the standard side of the business we are back in that  range  and higher yes gautam khanna  cowen and company  and higher so maybe wed get to  over the course of the year on average but probably not much beyond that given kind of our visibility today l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer this thing is going to move up from the fourth quarter level so we dont we wont expect to have our best quarter of the year in the first quarter so its going to ramp up but better than what we saw in the fourth quarter averaging i wont change that number i think for the year we averaged  to  gautam khanna  cowen and company okay thank you very much guys i appreciate it l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of tony rizzuto from bear stearns anthony rizzuto jr  bear stearns thank you very much hi pat and everyone l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer hi tony anthony rizzuto jr  bear stearns just a couple of questions here too my margin questions have been asked and thank you for that insight did i hear you correctly did i hear you say the  million pounds of the titanium product volume in  you are kind of holding to that that was kind of in line with your previous guidance is that what i heard did i hear it correctly l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer you did its still with the high performance side plus growing flatrolled side we had the  actually  last year and were looking for  million pounds this year its in the three categories high performance which is aerospace and defense our commercial products from direct business and our flatrolled side and our uniti joint venture direct and conversion business there anthony rizzuto jr  bear stearns okay so in total about  l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer  yes   anthony rizzuto jr  bear stearns  roughly and then the other question was in regards to your free cash flow and i was very happy to see you buy back some stock in the quarter should we assume when you look at other uses of that free cash flow given where your stock is now should we assume that thats probably a pretty attractive area for that excess cash if you will or should we also maybe think about with equity valuations coming down and your strong balance sheet might acquisitions move up a little bit in terms of that relative attractiveness l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer we dont we certainly dont remove anything from the horizon i think that we have a balanced approach to our cash with some aggressive capital program for organic growth that really will position this company as we move forward with the capabilities not just capacities capabilities for the sizes and products that we need to have to compete in this world as we go forward were really in a great position to put these assets in place and were doing that with the majority of the cash this year we also have the opportunity with certainly with whats in the market today to be a very valuebased buyer in buying our stock back so we have those two things and of course when we look at valuations across and outside of the company with this strong balance sheet it opens up the door for us to do things if in fact they look like they are the right strategic move for the company at the right time anthony rizzuto jr  bear stearns all right pat and my first obviously question wasnt really a question but if i could ask one more maybe just to pursue engineered products a little bit it was disappointing in our eyes and im sure in your eyes too but when should we expect that the ramp up the combined ramp up of youve got good end market demand it seems like but the raw material side has continued to be a bugaboo how do you see that proceeding as we move into  here l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer i feel like a broken record on this one but its this quarter we should see that business back in shape and back into a normal profitability this quarter anthony rizzuto jr  bear stearns okay by normal profitability what do you mean by that if you could maybe use a similar vernacular to the way you described for us the margins l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer we are looking about a  to  business thats what we want there anthony rizzuto jr  bear stearns okay thanks very much pat l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you tony operator your next question comes from the line of michael gambardella from jp morgan michael gambardella  jp morgan yes good afternoon pat and rich l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer hi mike richard j harshman  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer hi mike michael gambardella  jp morgan two questions one when you gave your guidance for the first quarter being basically flat with the fourth quarter are you referring to eps of  l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer we are referring to eps yes michael gambardella  jp morgan and what is your underlying assumption then for lifo the total lifo in that guidance for the first quarter l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer zero michael gambardella  jp morgan okay so you had a fairly sizable benefit in the fourth quarter and you are assuming that the eps is still going to stay the same without that benefit in the first quarter l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer exactly remember in the fourth quarter third quarter and the fourth quarter the reason i tried to point out these dramatic swings in our starting raw materials is that in our business as we are moving some of these longer lead time items through the third quarter was dramatically affected by nickel on the flatrolled side and the fourth quarter was dramatically affected by titanium scrap prices in the high performance side fortunately under the accounting that we had in lifo accounting we have the ability to mitigate that with the lifo reserves and as rich pointed out i think weve basically offset all of that in the fourth quarter so mike your point that the if you want to call it this way that the first quarter without lifo was a much cleaner quarter to look at margins and earnings we are saying its similar to the fourth quarter overall but maybe one that you can get a fairly better viewpoint of an improving margin base yes michael gambardella  jp morgan the lifo in the fourth quarter was about  million l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer right michael gambardella  jp morgan and then so if you tax effect that you are looking on an eps basis you are about  l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer yes thats right mike michael gambardella  jp morgan so you really look prelifo you are looking at  in the fourth going to somewhere around a  on an equivalent basis in the first so even with all this noise going on and concerns and everything you are still looking at a pretty substantial up quarter sequentially from fourth to first l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer yes and we get rid of the we have some lagging bufferstop bufferstock type material that has to get out of the way but we are basically saying that the negative effect of higher metal prices and higher inprocess inventories and lower selling prices due to the surchargers are now taken care of and the margins that we see are margins that we have built into these businesses michael gambardella  jp morgan okay l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer and then if you want to take the lifo completely out of the equation what your youre math is right michael gambardella  jp morgan all right and then last question what is your lockout period for doing your share buyback program when can you next go into the market and buy shares richard j harshman  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes mike this is rich our view is that its just today michael gambardella  jp morgan its just today richard j harshman  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer right michael gambardella  jp morgan so tomorrow you could be in buying shares richard j harshman  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer we could michael gambardella  jp morgan so i mean not to put words into your mouth but with the stock down almost  since october are you viewing the share buyback as one of your primary nearterm uses of cash richard j harshman  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer well as pat said we have a balanced view of cash usage but we bought  shares back in the fourth quarter at an average price of  and we thought that that was a good buy so you can make your own conclusion michael gambardella  jp morgan all right rich thank you very much richard j harshman  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer okay operator your next question comes from the line of robert lagaipa from oppenheimer bob lagaipa  oppenheimer  co hi good afternoon l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer hi bob bob lagaipa  oppenheimer  co i just wanted to follow up on the last question of the sequential change in terms of the eps about being the same what other puts and takes should we take from that i mean you mentioned the high performance you mentioned flatrolled getting better you are going to get the benefit of the lower retirement expense as well which is obviously going to help out i mean what type of tax rate are you using in your forecast for  richard j harshman  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer bob at this point were using  as the normalized tax rate bob lagaipa  oppenheimer  co  now thats actually thats a little bit higher than what youve been running at the last couple of quarters i mean is that just assuming that you are not going to get some of these tax benefits and whats the likelihood of additional tax benefits richard j harshman  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer well we dont have most of the tax benefits that we realized in  were the reversal of various valuation allowances that we had on state tax nol credit carryforwards because of changed circumstances that we under the application of gaap we have some opportunity perhaps for some items in  but that would be based upon a specific facts and circumstances evaluation every quarter so i mean at this point the only thing that we are thinking of is a more normalized tax rate of  l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer you dont think it will be higher richard j harshman  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer no well i dont think it will be higher bob lagaipa  oppenheimer  co okay terrific and last question if i could just on the volumes in the flatrolled business obviously they have been coming down for most of the year kicked back up here you mentioned the inventory seemed to be under control or the order activity has picked up in the last several weeks what kind of volumes are you expecting in the first quarter and what kind of ramp can we assume for the remainder of the year l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer well what weve said is that our targeted volumes are between around  tons and we expect to meet that rate in the first quarter bob lagaipa  oppenheimer  co okay terrific thanks very much operator and your next question comes from the line of lloyd carroll from davenport  company lloyd ocarroll  davenport equity research circling back to flatrolled if i look at profitability on an operating profit per pound which i think is better than percent margin there was a  drop from q to q was there anything unusual in terms of lifo that would account for a very depressed number in q l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer let rich take that go ahead richard j harshman  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer not really lloyd if you look at the q in the flatrolled products segment we had an  million benefit and in q we had a  million benefit i think the real issue was the significantly lower operating volume that we had in the second half of the third quarter that translated into higher per unit cost of much of the product that we shipped in the fourth quarter lloyd ocarroll  davenport equity research okay so as volume bounces back to service centers and other commodity customers then unit margins however you measure it should be rebounding on some schedule great okay thank you l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer thanks lloyd operator and your next question comes from the line of sal tharani from goldman sachs sal tharani  goldman sachs good afternoon pat l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer good afternoon sal tharani  goldman sachs just one question on electrical steel if you can give us some color on the electrical steel you make is it all grainoriented or do you make both grain nonoriented grainoriented whats the percentage l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer we make all grainoriented electrical steel all of ours is grainoriented its a product that weve made for many years its a high quality product we specialized in some of the lighter gauges that are shipped in that product that give better voltage regulation and we have a worldwide market today we are shipping one out of four pounds outside the us and we are shipping  of our products under ltas that have been signed and are locked sal tharani  goldman sachs are these ltas repriced every year l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer theyre repriced this year and theyre take or pay sal tharani  goldman sachs i see and do you did you get i mean one of your competitors yesterday mentioned that they got a  price increase more than  was this similar in your case l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer well we dont usually talk about that but we would think thats a conservative price increase sal tharani  goldman sachs and what kind of volume do you produce on electrical steel l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer  tons sal tharani  goldman sachs and thats in your high valueadded flatrolled l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer it is in our higher valueadded schedule now yes part of the high value in flatrolled yes sal tharani  goldman sachs great thank you very much l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of luke folta from longbow research luke folta  longbow research hey good afternoon l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer hi luke luke folta  longbow research hi i wanted to drill a little bit more on the maybe can you talk about what youre seeing from your customers in the commercial aerospace supply chain regarding their inventory levels and what youve been seeing as far as order rates are concerned over the last couple of weeks l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer i would say this that the order levels at the direct customers seem to be in line with their production and their increasing build rates moving into  up  to  on existing models i think what we are seeing is people buying for the needs that they have in the general distribution business in the specialty side of this i think there is caution from that part of the business in terms of how fast do you put in materials they are putting in materials that they need but are cautious about building inventories for the higher build rates our own feeling is that the  program and its qualification will debottleneck that whole side of the business so today we operate with about  under contract and  from the market that you are asking us about the best description i get today is that the order entry is busier and more active and there is a lot bubbling up whatever that means luke folta  longbow research okay and just on a side issue since last time you had your call one of your competitors timet decided not to go ahead with their sponge capacity expansion and i just was wondering if you could maybe comment on what you think the implications are there for the industry and kind of your overall take on that decision l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer well at the same time that corresponded to a contract with an outside supplier from japan and so i think that was probably a move that was calculated by them as to make or buy and they decided to buy at the best outlet one of the things that we said all along is that building a stateoftheart new sponge plant is not an easy undertaking in the united states with air permits building permits the technology of doing this and supply and engineering expertise so all those things combined you will have to timet what their decision was but our plant is up and the buildings are coming up the engineering is on track its been a its a big project but we are very very pleased and proud of the people that are running it its really quite a site out in rowley utah right now and we expect that one to be just as good as bringing up our albany oregon plant which is up and humming very very well for us as i said its the best source of metal units that we can find today at the best value at the lowest cost to make it ourselves luke folta  longbow research you said you are at  million pounds annual production now l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer we annualized last year at  million pounds we expect that will be  million pounds in  luke folta  longbow research great thank you very much l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator operator instructions and your next question comes from the line of timothy hayes timothy hayes  davenport  co of virginia inc hi good afternoon l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer good afternoon timothy timothy hayes  davenport  co of virginia inc just to clarify on the lifo i know in q there can true ups can you quantify for the two segments what if any trueups occurred in those lifo gains richard j harshman  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer well the easier one is the flatrolled products segment because if you go back and look and see where we were booked on lifo in each segment as of the end of the third quarter that would have suggested that we would have had a  million lifo benefit in q and in or a provision im sorry in flatrolled products and we had a  million benefit so that was a  million swing there and most of that had to do with liquidation of inventory as we focused on quite frankly getting our inventory quantities better in line the high performance metals segment was probably the bigger benefit there we were booked at roughly a  million benefit through the third quarter so that would have suggested that we would have had roughly an  million benefit in the fourth quarter and instead we had a  million benefit so there was a  million benefit in the fourth quarter largely due to a continued rapid decline in the cost of titanium scrap from in the neighborhood of  to  a pound in the third quarter down to around  a pound in the fourth quarter timothy hayes  davenport  co of virginia inc okay so then just make sure ive got the numbers right so a true up of  million for flatrolled and  million for high performance richard j harshman  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer right timothy hayes  davenport  co of virginia inc okay thank you richard j harshman  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer okay operator your next question comes from the line of gautam khanna from cowen and company l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer hello gautam khanna  cowen and company can you hear me l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer yes we can gautam khanna  cowen and company okay terrific just to follow up on your titanium assumptions in  you mentioned  million pounds kind of what are your assumptions with respect to the  program when does it does it pull the same amount of metal as youre anticipating on the q call and secondly kind of how does that boeing agreement work so that if they is there kind of a minimum they have to buy a maximum and then a level at which if they order more in a given period whether it be a month a quarter or what have you the profitability improves on those incremental units and so kind of whats the sensitivity around a delay a further delay l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer well we have a minimum take or pay quantity in this contract we have a nominal targeted quantity and then we have a search quantity what youre referring to in the search quantity is that that has some pricing formula to it that may be different than the guaranteed or nominal plus  we have some ranges there so when we look at that contract i would just say this that in  remember again all this metal that we are supplying the boeing corporation is fungible to boeing into all of their airplane programs they can use this titanium from the  through the  so the  to us would be theyre buying for the ramp up of that program but theyre also this metal at least is fungible across their system our projections and understanding for boeing is that we will have a better year with boeing in  than we had in  and so once we get to that point in time i would say that until this and this is our view of life from ati until this program powers on until it gets up for its first test flight and we have a more precise schedule as to the build rates and when it ramps the surge that were looking for is going to occur subsequent to those events gautam khanna  cowen and company okay i guess what im wondering is rich had mentioned in prior calls that youre looking for a  uptick in shipments  and  mill product titanium right now youre talking a little under  going from  to  presumably there is uncertainty on the  thats sort of driving the variability there and it sounds like the mix is shifting more to industrial markets the net effect of all this im wondering is is there a risk that if indeed the  is delayed call it six weeks more the fact that youre not in that surge bonus round or what have you of the shipments where profitability presumably is better that high performance margins kind of stay at that  throughout the year as opposed to whats implied at  or so l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer i would say this i would say we have a bigger risk on margins staying in the range that you just described from the  of our business that is spot business and is competitive in the marketplace without the surge in the airframe programs i think our margins under our ltas are pretty well locked in for us and we expect to see those the competitive part of the business comes in the serendipitous spot business and now ph those markets defense markets medical markets and general distribution for titanium products where you dont have the where you have a very balanced situation be it at high levels between demand and supply right now so thats where there is more price competition and i think that turns the corner when we see what ill call a surge in orders from the ramp up of these new airplane programs both the  and the  gautam khanna  cowen and company okay and lastly could you guide us on what you think asps are going to average out at on titanium mill next year  l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer id rather not guide on that thank you gautam khanna  cowen and company thanks a lot guys l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator i would now like to turn the call back over to mr hassey for closing remarks l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer well we want to thank everyone for joining us today its an interesting market to be in and its some great questions and the overall picture for us is just outstanding and we have

participants are in a listenonly mode we will be facilitating a questionandanswer session towards the end of todays conference operator instructions i would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for todays conference mr dan greenfield director of investor relations please proceed sir dan l greenfield  investor relations thank you heather good afternoon and welcome to allegheny technologies earnings conference call for the first quarter  this conference call is being broadcast live on our website at alleghenytechnologiescom and on ccbncom members of the media have been invited to listen to this call participating in the conference call today are pat hassey chairman president and chief executive officer and rich harshman executive vice president finance and chief financial officer after some initial comments we will ask for questions during the questionandanswer session please limit yourself to two questions to be considerate of others on the line please note that all forwardlooking statements made this afternoon are subject to various assumptions and caveats as noted in the earnings release actual results may differ materially here is pat hassey l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer thanks dan and thanks to everyone for joining us today we said the first quarter of  would be similar to our fourth quarter  performance and it was we also expected first quarter results to be negatively impacted by raw material costs being higher than the indices and surcharges used to determine selling prices this is a timing issue and it did indeed impact our first quarter results both in high performance metals and in flatrolled products so heres our view high performance metals segment operating profit was below our minimum target of  this was primarily due to two things first the timing mismatch between raw material cost and selling price indices and second lower nickelbased alloy volumes and a more competitive marketplace we saw some of our customers particularly distributors taking inventory management actions we believe inventories at these customers are now fairly lean in contrast shipments of our nickelbased alloys to jet engine oem customers remained solid we expect our high performance metal operating margins to hover in the highs until there is more conviction on the aerospace build schedules nickel alloy volumes continued to improve compared to the first quarter we expect titanium volumes to remain at high levels and our exotic alloys business is doing very well due to strong demand from the chemical process sector as well as growing demand from the nuclear energy market in the flatrolled products segment operating profit was  of sales this improvement of  basis points compared to the fourth quarter but operating profit fell below our minimum target of  we believe conditions now exist for our flatrolled products segment operating margins to recover to approximately  in the second quarter engineered products operating profit in the first quarter was again unacceptable operating performance in our forged products business and startup expense of our casting business at our new alpena michigan facility which is aimed at significant growth in the wind energy business negatively impacted this segments results were working hard to get engineered products’ operating margins back to about  our apt plant is working well and the operating issues encountered during the startup have been resolved in fact based on the current availability and price of apt we believe being fully integrated in apt is the right strategy for this business considering the uncertainties in the us economy and in the aerospace supply chain first quarter results reflect positively on the strength of ati earnings and what we consider to be the bottom of the current market direct international sales reached  of total sales we believe that more than  of our sales are driven by demand from nonus markets our key growth products continued doubledigit growth rates compared to the first quarter of  titanium product shipments increased  under atis diversified global market strategy exotic alloy shipments grew by  grainoriented electrical steel shipments grew by  our key financial metrics speak for themselves return on capital employed was over  return on stockholders’ equity was nearly  net debt to total capitalization was  we have a strong balance sheet we had  million of cash on hand at the end of the first quarter after we made significant investments in the business  million in managed working capital mostly due to the recovery in our flatrolled products business  million of new capital investment and we spent  million to repurchase  shares of ati stock as we have stated we have a balanced view of our use of cash our primary focus continues to be on investing for profitable growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet were also focused on creating value for our shareholders through our dividend policy and our share repurchase program finally we are committed to performance and execution in the first quarter we achieved gross cost reductions of  million again ahead of target lets move to our aerospace business this is an unprecedented global aerospace cycle our aircraft and jet engine customers report record backlogs over  large aircrafts on order their order rates had exceeded the build rates so far in  and production schedules for existing models are increasing the bulk of this backlog is for nonus based airlines the aging fleet is finally catching up with the legacy us carriers as these old planes get older they are likely to have more and more maintenance issues the chaos of domestic air travel that we have seen recently is further evidenced that the us fleet must be replaced sooner rather than later note last week american airlines announced that it is accelerating replacement of its old fleet with new boeing s according to american airlines these new planes are expected to deliver  better fuel economy and better reliability than the mds being replaced to expand our presence in the aerospace market we have formed ati aerospace a market sector team designed to bring the full breadth of our capabilities to jet engine and airframe customers for jet engine customers were at the forefront in developing advanced specialty metals for the next generation and future generation of jet engines for airframe customers… and remember airframe is a relatively new market for us we started by supplying only titanium products now were growing our supply of specialty alloys tungsten materials and cutting tools for difficulttomachine specialty metals no other company can offer customers such a span of specialty mill products and cutting tool technologies through ati aerospace were improving our position at existing customers while diversifying our customer and product base we have the right products and the right tools to continue to form collaborative partnerships with strategic customers the recently revised schedule for the  dreamliner brings nearterm uncertainty to the supply chain boeing has told us that they intend to honor our supply agreement remember our titanium products can be used on every boeing airframe we intend to continue to navigate through the nearterm and continue our focus on diversified mill product capabilities and on the diversified global markets that we serve in titanium we got off to a good start in  this resulted from a high level of demand from the aerospace and defense market as well as growth in our penetration into the industrial titanium markets were on track to reach our  target to ship approximately  million pounds of titanium this year in our flatroll products segment we have a lot of upside lets review this grainoriented electrical steel shipments grew  compared to the same period last year even with the us housing slowdown demand remained strong for replacement residential transformers and for nonresidential transformers demand also remained strong for the international markets nearly  of sales for this product were to customers outside the us we expect demand from this market to continue to be strong going forward our cp titanium sheet business continues to grow these are differentiated titanium products necessary for the global chemical process industry oil and gas and electrical energy markets we have a good understanding of these markets and good visibility through our ati international sales offices and through our unity titanium joint venture shipments of our specialty sheet and specialty plate products decreased compared to the same period last year due to the normal choppiness of capital projects however were now seeing strong demand for specialty sheet and specialty plate products from the oil and gas and electrical energy markets and we expect shipments to increase in the second quarter shipments of our precision rolled strip products were soft in the first quarter due to the us automotive and housing markets we expect shipments to improve in the second quarter as a result of expanded international sales and improved shipments to aerospace and defense customers standard sheet product shipments recovered to approximately  tons in the first quarter which when annualized is our targeted  to ton range now just a few comments about this industry service center inventory data was in the  to month supply in range during the first quarter which is low by historical standards this indicates that the us inventory destocking is over but restocking has not yet begun our shipments continue to improve shipments of our stainless sheet to international markets recovered to a high level we expect our improving penetration of international markets with these products to continue we expect base selling prices for our standard sheet to be flat to improving this includes the recent price increase for products shipped from ready coil inventories we continue our investments to give us unsurpassed manufacturing capabilities these investments enable profitable growth and build new capabilities for our diversified products in a diversified global market were launching new production facilities in  these facilities build on our foundation that gives ati the most advanced technology in our industry were building the right equipment and the right technology to maintain our leadership position in advanced specialty metals our titanium sponge facility in albany oregon is now producing at an annualized rate of  million pounds which is ahead of schedule our titanium sponge facility in rowley utah is on schedule and we expect to begin initial production in the fourth quarter of  our upgraded and expanded specialty and titanium plate facility in washington pennsylvania is nearly ready for its second quarter  launch and lastly we began producing and qualifying wind energy components at our new casting facility in alpena michigan in april our key growth markets aerospace and defense chemical processing oil and gas electrical energy and medical remains solid these markets represent  of our sales ati is well positioned to benefit from an extended commercial aerospace and defense cycle which is in its early stages ati is focused on the global infrastructure build and rebuild developed and developing countries need more oil and gas and electrical energy more fertilizers more food production and clean water atis products help enable sustainability through these systems that lead to greater environmentally sound energy production and improved energy efficiency ati is investing for profitable growth and creating a technology platform on which to build for the future our longterm outlook is positive we believe the first quarter  earnings represents the bottom  per share in the first quarter demonstrates atis ability to achieve stable earnings under difficult conditions looking forward base selling prices are generally flat to higher volumes continue to improve raw material surcharges and indices are in better balance we expect our second quarter earnings to be somewhat higher than the first quarter results and we expect to do better going forward with that brief explanation operator may we have the first question dan l greenfield  investor relations heather operator hello dan l greenfield  investor relations yes can we go to the questionandanswer period please question and answer operator sure operator instructions your first question comes from the line of john hill with citi please proceed john hill  smith barney citigroup great and thanks for the call everyone just a quick question to revisit this boeing and titanium situation i mean its great if they take their volumes in  but it creates a question about an overhang in  if you had to redirect those mill products elsewhere in your customer base could you sell them would have to cut volumes and would you make more money or less money if you could redirect those volumes elsewhere l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer john where we are lets just back up for a second and remember that we expect to ship the volumes that we had in our schedules during  to boeing also when we talk about boeing honoring their contracts we have multiyear contracts which include a minimum target and a maximum level so when we talk about their honoring their contracts we are talking about honoring the contracts straight through this contract period so thats the first point and there are significant volumes in that contract that are take or pay volumes that will be shipped under any circumstances thats the first point secondly were reaching… were running at a rate of  million pounds this year we had over  million pounds this shipment…  million pounds of titanium shipments in the first quarter we began to redirect some of those volumes as to grow to that  million pound level really in the second half of  so we are directing our shipments into more of the marine market into the tubing markets into the nuclear markets into the chemical processing industry to create that growth that we have committed to at the  million pounds i think were able to reach that growth this year and sustain that level throughout the future i think it will take the rampup of the new airplane programs both the  and the  to get us to that next plateau of around  million pounds so were very confident that we are going to reach the  million pound level we are gearing for that level we are stretching into the international markets for the titanium products that we have generating fairly good margins on all of these products and were looking forward to the growth into the new aerospace platforms as the production begins to rampup john hill  smith barney citigroup great perspective and then briefly could you just provide us a little bit more comfort as to why its believed that the mismatch between input costs and surcharges particularly titanium scrap that thats a situation that will be mitigated in the second quarter l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer well were looking at… were into the second quarter now so we know what the prices are in the market right now and they may move a quarter  something like that but what… the bookings that we have and what we see in this market we dont think that scrap prices are going to go into any type of a freefall or a tumble so as we look at the quarter we have john our titanium lead times are around  weeks so when we look at that we pretty much know what were doing in the second quarter we pretty much know what its priced at and hopefully we will have a good handle around this impact of lingering metal in the system that we had purchased or scrap that we had committed to that hit us in the first quarter that will not have the same impact on us into the second quarter john hill  smith barney citigroup great answer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of michael gambardella with jpmorgan please proceed michael gambardella  jpmorgan yes good afternoon l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer hi michael michael gambardella  jpmorgan hi i have a question how much material have you already shipped to the dreamliner in terms like on the… titanium frames that you supply to the dreamliner how many of those… the material for how many units are already out there in the system l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer it is a good speculative question as you know we are one of three major suppliers so we know what we shipped our volumes started back in  were higher in  were higher in  now thats because they were at a  delivered performance and a  quality meet all of our commitments and they can get the metal from whatever form or shape that they want it in if somebody else isn’t shipping i dont know i have said before that i thought there was at least around  ship sets at in this system so i am going to say… i am going to… this is pat hassey relatively giving you a guess okay michael  to  ship sets some place out there some place in the system some suppliers having more than others… having ordered more than others but basically these ship sets are at the built rate that i think meets boeing’s extended delivery with some lets call it shock absorber capability in their logistics supply or tmx to move those tonnages around to other airplane programs its all fungible between commercial and military and its all products that can be used on any boeing airframe so when you look at the total picture it gets complex to try to figure out from one supplier exactly where they are going to sit versus another supplier but i think its reasonable to assume that boeing is going to meet its commitment they’ve set to their supplier base i got a personal call that we will on honor our contracts we were taking the metal that weve talked to you about and we are going to work through this together michael gambardella  jpmorgan i mean can you say when the… when was the last time you shipped specifically materials to the dreamliner project l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer we cant tell you whether we shipped material to the dreamliner a  or a  unless we’re making a particular shape that we know is  dedicated to that particular airplane program but i can tell you that we were making shipments to the boeing corporation straight to the last days of the first quarter michael gambardella  jpmorgan sure okay thanks a lot pat operator your next question comes from the line of gautam khanna with cowen and company please proceed gautam khanna  cowen and company hello you made a comment about boeing honoring their commitments and when you say that do you mean the minimum commitment in  l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer i think its honoring their contracts this program has never rammed to what we would consider target level of shipments under our normal production schedule so when we talk about minimums in our contract were within grasp of those minimums in double digit maybe… numbers either direction not more than  either way from the minimums gautam khanna  cowen and company okay and if i recall on your last conference call you made a comment that when the ramp really picked up on  it could create a tightening of the supply shortage if you will that would drive prices in the marginal market the spot markets is the opposite true now that we have had some slack in the system a oneyear push out till full rate on the  should we expect further erosion and if so when does it appear and did it appear in q is that what we are seeing or is there yet some erosion to come l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer well if you noticed in our q our shipments were up i think  was the number so we certainly didnt see any erosion in total we shipped almost  million pounds of titanium products out of this business gautam khanna  cowen and company for the pricing erosion l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer pricing erosion if youre talking about the margin compression hits us hard when we have higher priced raw materials going into a pricing index that sells it for less money so if we have higher priced material running through our flow times and selling it for the current indices at the current pricing levels the margin contraction comes from the raw material mismatch i’ve tried to make that clear gautam khanna  cowen and company i understand that i guess that  l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer there is no margin contraction in our contracted volumes its our own problems of gautam khanna  cowen and company correct l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer mismatch is there so getting back to your full question i dont think were going to see a contraction i dont think thats the right answer i think what were going to see now is a more gradual increase to this build rate than what i had talked about earlier when we saw the original schedules of second revision from boeing versus the latest revision and ramp now we see a much more gradual ramp which ill call much more traditional to the boeing ramp up of programs versus stepping this up from shipping  airplanes to trying to get to a rate of shipping  or  airplanes the next year this is going to be a much more gradual ramp but you take the same result and spread it across say  to  months versus six months gautam khanna  cowen and company i understand i guess what im trying to reconcile are a couple of conflicting comments one comment is on the last earnings call you mentioned that the  of business in titanium that is not under contract could be the swing item if indeed the  ramp as projected there’s been a slip since that last call a material slip especially in terms of getting to full rate let alone first delivery isnt the opposite true namely pricing on those  sales that are not contracted under firmbased pricing could erode and if so is that why you are guiding to highs margins at high performance when are we going to start to see the dropoff in titanium spot pricing show up in your results beyond what they have already shown because we have already seeing pricing come over… it has declined  in this quarter in the q i dont know if that is mix dependent if you have more ingot versus mill or what have you but if you can work us through kind of the quarrel area of the argument you presented on q which was the  of business not under contract has pricing leverage if the  ramps as planned we know that thats not happening so when is this going to show up in pricing and margins l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer well its not happening in a steep ramp but the volume of that airplane program as it continues to improve whether it is the normal build rates of them making more total aircraft going from  planes to  or  planes to over  in  and a corollary to that with the airbus programs ramping slightly higher than the boeing programs so we have another  of material going into those programs that are not as high as usage as the  but each of those airplanes uses some titanium later models more than other models so it is more of a gradual move the second factor that we have is that as titanium is more available to your point we would suspect that we will see moderation in the spot market business the question of that just simply gets back to exactly what product form will the demand be in if we are talking about products that are going into lets say the heat exchanger or tubing markets i dont see much pricing pressure coming into those markets which are two large segments for us if we are talking about more commodity type of products that might be going into some less stringent applications i would agree with you that we could see some pricing degradation but overall i think that when we talk about staying around the highs thats where we are going to be in that area until we start to see this gradual ramp of the new airplane programs pushing the supply base tighter and as that tightens up we are going to see this spot prices rise as well as any spot business within that industry but basically i am looking for at least in our products and companies more about plateau more about not being able to move prices up but not too much pressure other than where we are at today so if that makes sense to you thats about as close as i can give it to you gautam khanna  cowen and company i appreciate the color last question and i will turn it over youve given some directional guidance on q we understand flatrolled is improving sequentially kind of what is your view today on the backhalf of this year in terms of eps what is q likely to look like i mean are going to two bucks a share is there… i mean give us some color because there are a lot of moving pieces here l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you i think if i had my own way id probably give your guidance but we are not going to give guidance on this year weve given guidance very clearly into the fourth and first quarter of this year i would like to get off that by just simply talking about what the markets are what the indicators are and youre going to have to put your own bent to what you think is going to happen in the market what we are saying is that we see the second quarter improving and we see our position gaining some speed going forward exactly how everything works out in this world and what happens to the exact number of scrap prices or reactions of the competitors as to their own volumes and situations we are going to just have to see how that road works out and navigate through it gautam khanna  cowen and company thanks a lot guys i appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of david martin with deutsche bank please proceed david martin  deutsche bank securities yes thank you i wanted to ask a few questions principally on the stainless market first of all can you update us on your operating rates in that market i think you had said in the first quarter you pretty much operated at full capacity within your target base load has that continued into the second quarter and then secondly can you give us a little bit of color on the divergence in the markets both in the us and europe it has been slightly reported that price attempts by you have failed in the us marketplace but despite that prices continue to increase in europe and some of your european peers are out trying to raise prices now for the third quarter and then lastly can you give us a sense of how many tons you would have shipped that to the us into europe in the quarter l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer i can just tell you on the last part of your question that were getting more and more interest in shipping more tons to europe i’d not like to report that exact number ill tell you that we were shipping at the highest levels we have ever exported into europe the european markets are actually moving faster than the us market and prices are actually rising and looks like that that market is returning to more normal levels in regards to our own operating schedules we are actually operating at a fuller rate in the second quarter than in the first quarter but it all depends on exactly which part of our subunits in this business that you are really talking about so let me just come back our nickelbased alloys and super alloys are operating at a higher level now in the second quarter than the first quarter we are at about  of our highest levels ever highest levels that we have ever operated in during  we are about  under that right now our electrical steel business is running as much volume as it can possibly put out the door our plate business was choppy in the first quarter because of project work that either got delayed or with the banking and credit issues and all that was going on just simply got moved out a couple of months and that business is now going to be operating at a much higher level im not saying  but a much higher level than it was in the first quarter were at  tons in the first quarter were going to be higher than that to achieve better returns and also more stable pricing in our standard sheet in the second quarter so generally speaking when you look at our second quarter were going to be operating at pretty much full the other issue that we have as we go into the third quarter we usually have some summer maintenance schedules to take care of on standard kind of maintenance schedules so were going to be pushing production into the second quarter so i think were going to operate at pretty full levels all the way through on the price increase i think they are moving in that direction as you pointed out in europe and i think thats… that appears solid and in the us we just had one competitor that evidently wasnt full or didnt think they should raise prices david martin  deutsche bank securities okay and then just wanted to followup on electrical steels i know youve commented in the past that youre going to see pretty meaningful price increases on contracts in  were those fully reflected in the first quarter are there some that get repriced at different times of the year l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer this has been integrated strategy that we had put into place where we have some contracts that expired in january we have other contracts that will be expiring at the end of this year in the fourth quarter of this year so we have not fully realized the full benefits of our changes in the electrical silicon business and so we still have some customers that are basically lets say running on  contracts that will expire sometime before or… before  weve other customers that have just been repriced for  that will run for the next few years and we now have a situation that basically  of our business is under one type of a contract or another and these contracts are integrated throughout each year so we have a blended price going forward david martin  deutsche bank securities okay thank you operator year next question comes from the line of david macgregor with longbow research please proceed david macgregor  longbow research yes good afternoon everyone l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer hi david david macgregor  longbow research pat just on the stainless business if youre not getting the price increase can you just talk about your inability to improve second quarter gross margins in stainless l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer well we do have a price increase in the ready coil and we do have price increases on offshore businesses so thats the first point okay secondly we are improving situations in plate and in highperformance side of that business both in titanium nickelbased alloys and were already full on electrical steels were talking about standard sheet and standard sheet only… and will have greater volume david macgregor  longbow research and can you just talk a little bit about your maybe to the extent you can talk about just the cost base on your scrap when does cheaper scrap start to flow through the pl l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer i think in the… i think now i think in the second quarter certainly got not a few pennies per share in the first quarter david macgregor  longbow research okay second question just has to do… i guess back onto the titanium issue and you talked about your ability to redirect titanium if this boeing program should continue to pushed out further im just wondering what the capacity is of those other markets might be to absorb that redirected material it doesn’t seem like that long ago we were getting excited about golf club heads and high glass frames and  seems to really have been the driver since  so without that im just trying to get a sense from you what you feel the capacity might be to move that product l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer well i think there is two things it is really the infrastructure build around the world what we are seeing is… and i think i made a comment in the press release that our bookings in the asian market were at record levels in  and we’re far exceeding those levels in  this is basically titanium industrial applications so we are talking about products that are going into chemical processing industry sulfuric acid plants were talking about clean water were talking about the middle east were talking nuclear applications on the rebuild and some of the projects going on there so we work finding people are coming and knocking on our door as they believe that titanium is more readily available and at prices that they can afford and also that the industrial side of the market can move back into titanium applications that maybe were being substituted by high nickelbased steels stainless steel david macgregor  longbow research good thanks and good luck to you l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of chris olin with cleveland research please proceed chris olin  cleveland research hi there l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer hi chris chris olin  cleveland research pat i just want to make sure i am clear what exactly is going on in the nickelbased alloys marketplace i know you talked a little bit about distributors but is there something else within those numbers that may get lower than it shouldn’t ph be l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer well it was whereas volumes that i think happened in the first quarter if you’re talk about the first quarter results and lower volumes and more competitive pricing were my comments two things happened one it was kind of a onetime quarter in that i think we saw people that because of their earnings last year may have pulled more nickel into the fourth… our fourth quarter of  and then we also had other people in the marketplace that have fiscal quarters ending that maybe pushed some material out of the first quarter into our second quarter so we think that the second quarter right now chris appears to be very similar to the quantities that we shipped in the fourth quarter recovering to more normal levels and we will see where we are i think from a competitive standpoint as we looked at some of the quotes we were seeing in the marketplace that we saw people getting more aggressive about bringing nickel into their order base so well just have to see how that plays out as these markets come back in increasing volume on the sheet side of the business we saw a… very much of a filling of our schedule over the first quarter into second and third quarter kind of schedule so we are watching that carefully well just have to see where it recovers i’d just characterize it this way volumes are going to be covered and we are going to watch the competitive pricing situation chris olin  cleveland research is there any issue with the  on that specific marketplace or is  l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer not through us because we were growing into that market and so were growing and again its frangible kind of products for us what i like about the aerospace business in general it’s at the early stages they’ve got  airplanes on order the strategy continues to be to ramp the existing models especially the later versions and we have two more airplanes coming on stream so its very important to recognize that as boeing or airbus moved from the lets say  to  range and then to the  to  range but this is significant business to all of their suppliers without the new airplane programs and so as we do that plus add the  i think first to that airplane ramp and then a more gradual ramp now on the  were going to see those volumes continue to grow only on a much more gradual basis than a steepstepped ramp chris olin  cleveland research okay i guess lastly im not sure if anybody else has tried so ill give it a shot can you define somewhat better i mean consensus for the second quarter is  inaudible   l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer i am going to let rich answer the question on that richard j harshman  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer hi chris it is somewhat better what we said was we thought the first quarter at  was the bottom for all the reasons pat has articulated we see the second quarter is somewhat better and were really not going to get into the… giving specific guidance because when we do that nobody seems to listen to us anyway so we will stick with a somewhat better description chris olin  cleveland research okay l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer thanks chris operator your next question comes from the line of mark parr with keybanc capital markets please proceed mark parr  keybanc capital markets okay thanks very much good afternoon l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer hi mark mark parr  keybanc capital markets i just wanted to make sure i heard what you had said in response to the question that chris just asked when you were talking about the flatrolled nickel alloy did you say that volume moment was picking up in the second and third quarter based on your older momentum l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer yes we had a record load during a portion of  we are now back to  of that record load which is a very very good forward load for us so i think we see flat to increasing prices we see more volume especially in our nickelbased alloys when you couple that with the cp sheet we should see some very nice numbers coming out of our high performance side of the flatrolled business mark parr  keybanc capital markets okay and if i could ask one more question on the as far as your service center business in the stainless market could you talk a little bit about what youre seeing from an inventory perspective here as we move into the second quarter l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer well i think whats happening in this market with all the uncertainties and issues that we have its unusual and as you know for these us distributors to have inventories at three times their annual shipments…  times their annual shipments mark parr  keybanc capital markets yes these are very low numbers l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer yes very very low numbers secondly theyre willing to pay a substantial premium for the mills inventories within ready coil to handle the outages or to handle special requirements or the buffer through to the business so the question is are they going to continue to operate at these levels or at some point in time are they just simply going to say theyre going to restock and i think were getting nickel prices that seem to be leveling out in the current  to  lets say ranges i think as people get comfortable with the fact that those numbers are going to be relatively stable and they look and see that certain parts of this market continue to pull on a very strong basis ill give you… one example is appliances you may think that the appliance market might be suffering from the housing market i can tell you the appliance market are running wide open and that is maybe after market or somebody not going to buy a new house but they are going to remodel their old kitchen i dont really know but i can tell you that the appliance markets are very strong in comparison to what you might think in the housing market so i think they’re seeing not an escalating great business but they are certainly seeing a sustained stable business at a higher level than what we saw in the certainly in the second half of last year and into the first quarter it is improving and getting stronger so i think the prices in that market and volumes… volume is definitely moving up for us and prices are flat too improving in that market there is certainly not going to be more discounting mark parr  keybanc capital markets so maybe if i could just ask you just a general macro question given what you just shared when you think based on your customers and the business you are seeing do you think were moving closer to or further away from a recessionary scenario for the economy l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer well we can only talk about the segments that we deal with and the segments that we deal with in durable goods and then of course in the… some of the things that i just mentioned we think well over  of our revenues are coming really from end customers that are outside united states mark parr  keybanc capital markets okay l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer and if we take away housing and automotive which hurt us in the precision strip business in the us two things happened we would say that our markets are getting better and when we add the international markets to it and the value of the us dollar lets say into eu markets weve opportunities to grow in those markets and when we look at the growth in china and india you can argue whether the growth in china is going to be  or  so the first quarter it was over  the second quarter looks very busy for us and when we look at the opportunities to sell into the middle east and to india we see the same kind of things  or  growth so for products that were making in the specialty infrastructure build kind of things electricity distribution of electricity power generation clean water these kind of infrastructure applications that requires specialty materials which really those economies are not making and havent had the technology or the provision to make we see a pretty bright future for that segment of the business if i was going to worry about anything i’d still worry like everybody else does that  of the markets are driven by the consumer in the us so were pushing our strategies to those durable goods markets in the international markets for a diversified product base and a diversified strategy of selling around the world mark parr  keybanc capital markets great pat thanks for all that color i really appreciate it l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer thanks operator your next question comes from the line of sanil daptardar with sentinel please proceed sanil daptardar  sentinel asset management thanks in the opening comments you mentioned about the highperformance metal segment that the marketplace is getting more competitive could you just elaborate on that what you mean by that l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer well weve seen it mostly on the nickelbased alloys where people have put some capacities in over the last year i think they would like to fill those capacities and it depends on where they are qualified or what segments that they were in when you look at atis mill products and this is where you have to differentiate this company from some of the other companies we produce products that range from seamless tubing and wire to sheet and plate and rounds and shapes that we can enter various segments to produce products that are needed in those segments other people have a more narrower alley to go down and so as we go… come into some of those markets to sell products we can see more competitive pricing today than what we saw in  sanil daptardar  sentinel asset management okay so… then your commentary on flat to increasing prices may not remain may not stand still in that case then we may probably see some price increases in that business right l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer i think when we look at the inaudible side of the business super alloys and nickelbased alloys and titanium products that… what i said is that we see a much stronger workload on the books today and the second quarter than we saw in the fourth quarter and even entering into the first quarter so with that kind of a situation and extending lead times on those products my history has been when you have order loads that are growing you have lead times that are extending and you have global access indeed that prices eventually move with that sanil daptardar  sentinel asset management okay l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer yes rich go ahead richard j harshman  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes just one more thing when you look at the high performance metals segment and more specifically the nickel and specialty alloys products in that segment about  of our business in that segment in nickel and specialty alloys is under longterm agreements so there you really… you dont have the kind of pricing issues that were talking about other than the changes in the raw material indices sanil daptardar  sentinel asset management okay richard j harshman  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer okay sanil daptardar  sentinel asset management thats a good clarification on the boeing contract of course you would be shipping the volumes now in case of the pricing for those volumes is it at the market rate or it’s at the contract price and does it tend to move with the market rate or what how is that contract structure l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer it is at contract pricing but it does reflect metal indices that change but its a contracted price for the base pricing with some leading indicators around the raw materials that go into the pricing metrics and thats part of the overall formula so… but its fixed pricing sanil daptardar  sentinel asset management okay its fixed pricing so  l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer with raw material indices that reflect the cost of raw material sanil daptardar  sentinel asset management well for example now you had a  decline in the titanium products average selling price so is that reflected in that boeing contract kind of… if there is a decline in the price then probably that your price might be also declining with it l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer the price would decline but it doesnt necessarily mean the margins will decline it should not mean the margins declined the price declines because we can buy raw materials at lower prices now when we look at that this is where we get into this problem in a short period of time in a threemonth fourmonth sixmonth period of time of mismatches of material we have in this system or have procured in our own arrangements and what we can sell for as prices are changing so thats the mismatch that i think gave us some lower earnings in the first quarter sanil daptardar  sentinel asset management okay if i ask the last question inaudible on the distributor side you saw that they are not restocking but the destocking cycle is over what rate do you have when the distributors may start restocking basically to stainless products l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer well usually if there is a restocking then we are going to see schedules moving and pricing moving so… because we’re… we and most other mills are running at fairly good volumes for these markets and with the us dollar where it is it isnt very profitable for certain foreign mills to be shipping into the us from product produced in their own country the exception for that is countries that may manipulate currency and bring it into the us sanil daptardar  sentinel asset management in other words is the restocking basically would be dependent on the demand if they are not seeing any kind of improvement in the demand is there a need for restocking thats what the distributors might be wondering so is that the way one should read that or  l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer i think if they see the demand as stable and where it is and things leveling up the question they have to ask themselves at that point in time is are we going to continue to buy from the mills inventories of ready coil at premium prices or decide to restock some of these quantities and carry the risk in our own inventories today they are choosing to pay the premium prices to the mills for their inventories that are being carried in ready coil form sanil daptardar  sentinel asset management okay thank you l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of tim hayes with davenport timothy hayes  davenport  co hi good afternoon l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer hello timothy hayes  davenport  co my question pertains to the high performance metals segment and specifically in the nickelbased alloys the decline in volumes there i was surprised that the customers waited till q  to destock is the destocking by customers is that in a specific endmarket such as jet engines or is it in a broader range of endmarkets l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer i think it was across the board you can a pick a specific customer that decided to pull something into the fourth quarter and then level his business back out into the first quarter that is now back to normal shipment levels we can isolate a couple of those you can pick distributors that had higher based nickel in their inventory that they wanted to drain down take those inventories to a linear level during the first quarter and i think those have… that basically what we were seeing is that we were going to see nickel volumes much more in line with what we had seen in the fourth quarter starting in the second quarter forward rich go ahead richard j harshman  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes this is another expansion of that the distributor customers for nickel alloys on the high performance metals side those are not the premium materials for aeroengines those are products that largely go into the oil taps to the corrosion markets the noncritical more static parts on a jet engine so thats really where the inventory management and destocking was going on i think the oem customers were more pulling into the fourth quarter or pushing out a little bit into the second quarter depending upon their own unique situation but it was not a demand driven phenomena the oil patch market has been going through an inventory destocking phase on nickel alloys for a while and we see that gradually working its way through here in the second quarter not only in the us market but also in europe timothy hayes  davenport  co very good thank you operator your next question comes from the line of sal tharani with goldman sachs please proceed sal tharani  goldman sachs good afternoon l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer good afternoon sal sal tharani  goldman sachs pat i was just wondering hearing your comments it looks like not much is going… happening until the boeing situation gets a little more clear which will be a few quarters away from here you have a lot of cash on your hand granted you are using a lot of money on capex also im sure youll find your stocks cheap i am sure some of the investors find it cheap why not just… and you are very delevered why not just lever up and do a massive share buyback l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer well our first priority sal is the profitable growth of the company what we are looking at is the longterm value sorry the longterm this is a longterm franchise longterm really valuebased franchise if you believe in the aerospace business and if you believe in the infrastructure build around the world and if you believe in the technology of this company its geopolitical security and its ability with the us dollar today to ship on a global basis the best use of our money today for our shareholders is to position this company both from an unsurpassed manufacturing capability and the technology that we have into this new base to provide new opportunities and new products to grow this company and really make it a longterm franchise for someone to hold thats our first priority second priority comes after that is dividend policy of the company weve had increasing dividends over the last three years and we have an announced and specified share repurchase program we think in todays world a company that has the balance sheet that we have growing in the right markets with the right technology in the right country is a heck of a value at the price of where we are today and we believe that as we demonstrate that with the stability of earnings that we have even in this down cycle over the last six months with the stability of earnings that we have and the ability to increase those earnings in the short to medium term thats the best use of our cash and that’s what we are doing in a very balanced way sal tharani  goldman sachs okay going back on the nickelbased alloys i was just wondering if i look at the you mentioned that nickelbased alloys had a base price plus some plus the raw material cost if i go back at  nickel level these prices were hovering around   a pound has something changed or do you think there is a lag effect and you may go down to that level on your average selling price going forward l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer i think that in the contracted business we have that the prices are pretty much set i think in… depending on what happens to the total market and the volume and how aggressive the industry wants to get on picking up certain parts of the spot business that it could be a very competitive market for a period of time until the volumes in the aerospace business continue to pick up under these new build rates we continue to see another  or  to  build in the next  months out of the aerospace business we continue to see the need for energy in these big landbased turbines and growth in the middle east and also growth in asia we continue to see the need in the nuclear business this is all going to catch up so there is going to be some shortterm dislocations if you want to call them that some competitive issues we are a company thats well positioned that has a market share that is not going to erode so yes we may meet some of those situations along the way richard j harshman  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer sal this is richard another thing to reflect upon is that when nickel prices were     a pound obviously the information we disclose is heavily mix sensitive what product form were selling is it an ingot billet bar et cetera what grade of nickel is it because they are all different kind of grades in terms of how much nickel contained is in it but if you go back to our third quarter and the public information that is out there when nickel was at a much higher price the average prices for the products as we disclosed it were over  so when nickel was at  or  the average selling prices were not at  or  sal tharani  goldman sachs got it so it looks like your base prices have come up also richard j harshman  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer yes once again it just depends upon what the product is and what the market is sal tharani  goldman sachs okay and one more on the mismatch between inventories… sorry raw materials and selling price you mentioned how much inventory do you tell… how many months should we expect this mismatch to continue and continuing on that i thought that youre using lot more sponge now because youre making about what  million tons of sponge and using lot less scrap l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer well on the nickel side we are a net buyer of outside nickel and we do use scrap and we do have revert programs coming back through the company our lead times on nickel are well into the third quarter and if you want a shape or a rectangle it moves out further if you want a round bar its center so we’ll just have to see how the markets play out in total as rich pointed out twothirds of what were doing is under contract those prices are set so we have that onethird exposure to whatever happens in the market richard j harshman  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer and i think the… we… obviously the answer to the question of how long until the indices and surcharges are in better balance with the cost flowing through the income statement depend on the stability of the raw material cost we believe that and we’ve said this in the news release that those indices and surcharges are in much better balance heading into the second quarter than they were in the first quarter on your question in terms of titanium sponge yes were using all the sponge were producing at albany that gives us a defined cost but not all of our products are  sponge melted so generally a heat contains a mix of both sponge and scrap and the indices are based off of that sal tharani  goldman sachs do you have ability to use more sponge in your products or some of the products dont lend themselves to inaudible richard j harshman  executive vice president finance and chief financial officer in some cases we can use all sponge sheets in other cases… in many cases we cannot because of the metallurgical specifications and targets were trying to hit sal tharani  goldman sachs and youre bringing more sponge capacity early next year are you confident that there will be enough demand or you will just be replacing more and more scrap with that l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer well be replacing some scrap but we also are buying from the outside so as that comes up and we reach the  million pound level… you remember we started this year off that  million pound level we’re adding  million pounds this year i think we will be in pretty much balance of what we need to do next year what were looking forward to after that is the ramp to the  million pound level which wont happen unless we see the new airplane program so thats our feeling when that happens then well see the rest of these facilities ramp up with it so thats where we are sal tharani  goldman sachs okay thank you very much l patrick hassey  chairman president and chief executive officer thank you operator as there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the call back over to pat hassey for closing remarks l patrick hassey  chairman
