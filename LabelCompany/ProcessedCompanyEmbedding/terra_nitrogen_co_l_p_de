terra nitrogen limited partnership tnlp or the operating partnership and collectively with tnclp the partnership terra nitrogen gp inc tngp or the general partner a delaware corporation is the general partner of both tnclp and tnlp and owns a  general partner interest in each of tnclp and tnlp the general partner is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of cf industries holdings inc cf industries a delaware corporation ownership of tnclp is composed of the general partner interests and the limited partner interests the general partner interest in tnclp is represented by  general partner units limited partner interests are represented by common units which are listed for trading on the new york stock exchange under the symbol tnh and class b common units as of march    we had  common units and  class b common units issued and outstanding cf industries through its subsidiaries owned  common units representing approximately  of the total outstanding common units and all of the class b common units as of march    we are a master limited partnership mlp partnerships are generally not subject to federal income tax although publicly traded partnerships such as tnclp are treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes and therefore are subject to federal income tax unless at least  of the partnerships gross income is qualifying income as defined in section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended and the partnership is not required to register as an investment company under the investment company act of  as we currently satisfy the requirements to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes no federal income taxes are paid by the partnership on january   the internal revenue service irs issued final regulations on the types of income and activities that constitute or generate qualifying income of a mlp for calendar year mlps the effective date of the regulations is january   the regulations have the effect of limiting the types of income and activities that qualify under the mlp rules subject to certain transition provisions the regulations define the activities that generate qualifying income from certain processing or refining and transportation activities with respect to any mineral or natural resource including fertilizer as activities that generate qualifying income but the regulations reserve on specifics regarding fertilizerrelated activities however the irs has issued a private letter ruling to a taxpayer in the fertilizer industry unrelated to tnclp which would indicate that each taxpayers fertilizer manufacturing activities should produce qualifying income for purposes of determining whether  of the partnerships gross income is qualifying income the entity to which this private letter ruling was issued would appear to operate a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing business that is similar to ours while this private letter ruling provides some insight into the manner in which the irs analyzed fertilizer manufacturing activities at the time this ruling was issued this private letter ruling is specific to a different entity thus the irs is not bound to follow it in respect of tnclp nor may we rely on it as precedent when determining whether we satisfy the mlp  gross income test any change in the federal income tax treatment of income from fertilizerrelated activities as qualifying income could have a material impact on the taxation of the partnership and could have a material adverse impact on unitholder distributions we continue to monitor these irs regulatory activities the accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december    in

asu no  changes the inventory measurement principle for entities using the firstin firstout fifo or average cost methods for entities utilizing one of these methods the inventory measurement principle changed from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value we follow the fifo or average cost methods and the adoption of this asu did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements recently issued pronouncement in may  the fasb issued asu no  revenue from contracts with customers topic  which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in asc topic  revenue recognition this asu is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services this asu also requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments additionally the costs to obtain and fulfill a contract including assets to be recognized are to be capitalized and such capitalized costs are to be disclosed in july  the fasb voted to defer the effective date of this asu through the issuance of asu no  revenue from contracts with customers deferral of the effective date to december   for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after that date accordingly we will adopt asu no  as amended beginning in our first quarter of  we are currently evaluating the impact of

the general partner to reduce our exposure to changes in commodity prices for natural gas natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers the derivatives that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and options traded in the overthecounter otc markets the derivative contract prices are based on nymex future prices based on physical delivery of natural gas at the henry hub in louisiana the most common and financially liquid location of reference for derivative financial instruments related to natural gas however we purchase natural gas for our manufacturing facility from suppliers whose prices are based primarily on the oneok index based on physical delivery of natural gas in oklahoma rather than at the henry hub this creates a location basis differential between the derivative contract price and the price we pay for physical delivery of natural gas accordingly the prices underlying the derivative financial instruments we use may not exactly match the prices of natural gas we purchase and consume we enter into natural gas derivative contracts with respect to gas to be consumed by us in the future and settlements of those derivative contracts are scheduled to coincide with our anticipated purchases of natural gas used to manufacture nitrogen products during those future periods we use natural gas derivatives as an economic hedge of gas price risk but without the application of hedge accounting we report derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value changes in fair

months ended march    we used derivatives to cover approximately  of our natural gas consumption the counterparties to our derivative contracts are multinational commercial banks major financial institutions and large energy companies the derivatives are executed with several counterparties generally under international swaps and derivatives association isda agreements most of the isda agreements contain creditriskrelated contingent features such as crossdefault provisions and credit support thresholds that are dependent upon the credit ratings of the general partner affiliate in the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade of the general partner affiliate the counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require the general partner affiliate to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position the general partner affiliate’s revolving credit agreement at any time when it is secured provides a cross collateral feature for those derivatives that are with counterparties that are party to or affiliates of parties to the revolving credit agreement so that no separate collateral would be required for those counterparties in connection with such derivatives in the event the general partner affiliates revolving credit agreement becomes unsecured the general partner affiliate could be required to post separate collateral in connection with such derivatives as of march   and december    the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features in a net liability position was  million and  million  respectively which also approximates the fair value of the maximum amount of assets needed to settle the obligations if the creditriskrelated contingent features were triggered and the general partner affiliate was unable to post collateral at the reporting dates as of march   and december    we and the general partner affiliate had no cash collateral on deposit for derivative contracts the credit support documents executed in connection with certain isda agreements generally provide the general partner affiliate and the counterparties

options traded in the otc markets with multinational commercial banks other major financial institutions and large energy companies the derivatives are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods these contracts settle using nymex futures prices and accordingly to determine the fair value of these instruments we use quoted market prices from nymex and standard pricing models with inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as forward curves supplied by an industryrecognized unrelated third party see note  —derivative financial instruments for additional information assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis we also have assets that may be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis that is the assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances such as when there is evidence of impairment these include longlived assets that may be written down to fair value as a result of impairment we determined that these fair value measurements rely primarily on partnershipspecific inputs and the

commodities and are subject to price competition the customers for our products make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality the selling prices of our products fluctuate in response to global market conditions and changes in supply and demand over the past decade strong demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins as a result of higher global nitrogen fertilizer prices stimulated global investment in nitrogen production facilities which resulted in an increase in global nitrogen fertilizer production capacity as a result global nitrogen fertilizer supply increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand creating the current global oversupply in the market and leading to lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices a significant amount of new nitrogen production capacity came on line in  and additional production capacity is expected to come on line in  including a significant increase in production capacity in north america this new nitrogen production capacity includes the capacity expansion projects that were completed in  by affiliates of our general partner the new nitrogen production capacity will further increase supply we expect the lower priced environment to continue until global supply and demand become more balanced through a combination of

during the three months ended march   with the decrease primarily resulting from the unplanned ammonia plant outage in the first quarter of   capital expenditures are made to sustain our asset base to increase capacity to improve plant efficiency and to comply with various environmental health and safety requirements due to the size scope and timing of capital projects certain projects require more than a year to complete in   we currently expect to make capital expenditures in the range of  million to  million  planned maintenance capital expenditures and turnarounds are subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals andor permitting unanticipated increases in cost changes in scope and completion time performance of third parties delay in the receipt of equipment adverse weather defects in materials and workmanship labor or material shortages transportation constraints and other unforeseen difficulties we anticipate a planned turnaround of onehalf of our verdigris nitrogen complex  terra nitrogen company lp will occur in  we had previously estimated that this turnaround would occur in late  but the turnaround has been delayed due to a delay in receiving certain equipment the turnaround will result in lower ammonia and uan production lower sales and lower profitability during the period of the turnaround which will reduce available cash for distributions to unitholders we expect this turnaround will cost approximately  million  and the calculation of available cash for the three months ended march   included a reserve of approximately onehalf of this

as defined in our agreement of limited partnership available cash is defined generally as all cash receipts less all cash disbursements less certain reserves including reserves for future operating and capital needs established as the general partner determines in its reasonable discretion to be necessary or appropriate changes in working capital affect available cash as increases in the amount

continue to be both debtors and creditors to us derivatives we purchase natural gas at market prices to meet production requirements at our manufacturing facility natural gas prices are volatile and our natural gas acquisition policy allows us to establish derivative positions that are associated with anticipated natural gas requirements the derivatives that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and options traded in the overthecounter markets natural gas derivatives involve the risk of dealing with counterparties and their ability to meet the terms of the contracts the counterparties to our natural gas derivatives are multinational commercial banks major financial institutions and large energy companies for derivatives that are in net asset positions we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties credit risk is controlled through the use of multiple counterparties credit limits credit monitoring procedures cash collateral requirements

critical accounting policies or offbalance sheet arrangements relative to those disclosed in item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our  annual report internal revenue service regulation impacting master limited partnerships we are a master limited partnership mlp partnerships are generally not subject to federal income tax although publicly traded partnerships such as tnclp are treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes and therefore are subject to federal income tax unless at least  of the partnerships gross income is qualifying income as defined in section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended and the partnership is not required to register as an investment company under the investment company act of  as we currently satisfy the requirements to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes no federal income taxes are paid by the partnership on january   the internal revenue service irs issued final regulations on the types of income and activities that constitute or generate qualifying income of a mlp for calendar year mlps the effective date of the regulations is january   the regulations have the effect of limiting the types of income and activities that qualify under the mlp rules subject to certain transition provisions the regulations define the activities that generate qualifying income from certain processing or refining and transportation activities with respect to any mineral or natural resource including fertilizer as activities that generate qualifying income but the regulations reserve on specifics regarding fertilizerrelated activities however the irs has issued a private letter ruling to a taxpayer in the fertilizer industry unrelated to tnclp which would indicate that each taxpayers fertilizer manufacturing activities should produce qualifying income for purposes of determining whether  of the partnerships gross income is qualifying income the entity to which this private letter ruling was issued would appear to operate a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing business that is similar to ours  while this private letter ruling provides some insight into the manner in which the irs analyzed fertilizer manufacturing activities at the time this ruling was issued this private letter ruling is specific to a different entity thus the irs is not bound to follow it in respect of tnclp nor may we rely on it as precedent when determining whether we satisfy the mlp  gross income test any change in the federal income tax treatment of income from fertilizerrelated activities as qualifying income could have a material impact on the taxation of the partnership and could have a material adverse impact on unitholder distributions we continue to monitor these irs regulatory activities  terra nitrogen company lp forwardlooking statements from time to time in this quarterly report on form q as well as in other written reports and oral

be fully insured • risks associated with cyber security • weather conditions • potential liabilities and expenditures related to environmental health and safety laws and regulations and permitting requirements • future regulatory restrictions and requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions • the seasonality of the fertilizer business • risks involving derivatives and the effectiveness of our risk measurement and hedging activities • limited access to capital • acts of terrorism and regulations to combat terrorism • risks related to our dependence on and relationships with cf industries • deterioration of global market and economic conditions • risks related to our partnership structure and control of the general partner by cf industries • changes in our available cash for

are exposed to the impact of changes in the price of natural gas which we use in the manufacture of our nitrogen fertilizer products because natural gas prices are volatile we manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments the derivative instruments that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and options these contracts settle using nymex futures prices which represent the basis for fair value at any given time the derivatives are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated natural gas purchases during those future periods as of march   and december    we had open natural gas derivative contracts for  million mmbtus and  million mmbtus respectively a  per mmbtu increase in the

partnership mlp partnerships are generally not subject to federal income tax although publicly traded partnerships such as tnclp are treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes and therefore are subject to federal income tax unless at least  of the partnerships gross income is qualifying income as defined in section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended and the partnership is not required to register as an investment company under the investment company act of  as we currently satisfy the requirements to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes no federal income taxes are paid by the partnership on january   the internal revenue service irs issued final regulations on the types of income and activities that constitute or generate qualifying income of a mlp for calendar year mlps the effective date of the regulations is january   the regulations have the effect of limiting the types of income and activities that qualify under the mlp rules subject to certain transition provisions the regulations define the activities that generate qualifying income from certain processing or refining and transportation activities with respect to any mineral or natural resource including fertilizer as activities that generate qualifying income but the regulations reserve on specifics regarding fertilizerrelated activities however the irs has issued a private letter ruling to a taxpayer in the fertilizer industry unrelated to tnclp which would indicate that each taxpayers fertilizer manufacturing activities should produce qualifying income for purposes of determining whether  of the partnerships gross income is qualifying income the entity to which this private letter ruling was issued would appear to operate a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing business that is similar to ours  while this private letter ruling provides some insight into the manner in which the irs analyzed fertilizer manufacturing activities at the time this ruling was issued this private letter ruling is specific to a different entity thus the irs is not bound to follow it in respect of tnclp nor may we rely on it  table of contents terra nitrogen company lp as precedent when determining whether we satisfy the mlp  gross income test any change in the federal income tax treatment of income from fertilizerrelated activities as

providing access to rail transport we also have access to a mile ammonia pipeline the complex has onsite storage for  tons of ammonia and  tons of uan providing us with flexibility to handle temporary disruptions to shipping activities without impacting production our capital expenditures are primarily related to plant maintenance and turnaround projects to sustain our asset base to increase capacity to improve plant efficiency and to comply with various environmental health and safety requirements occasionally we have had other capital expenditure projects related to items such as the installation of new plant control systems or construction of additional onsite storage including the construction of a new  ton capacity uan tank that was completed in  planned capital expenditures and plant turnarounds are subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals andor permitting unanticipated increases in cost changes in scope and completion time performance of third parties

agricultural areas of the midwestern united states and has ready access to barge truck and rail transportation in addition the verdigris facility has access to an ammonia pipeline to transport product to high demand regions competition the market for nitrogen fertilizer products is global and intensely competitive competition in the nitrogen fertilizer market is based primarily on delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality during the peak demand periods product availability and delivery time also play a role in the buying decisions of customers agrium inc koch nitrogen company cvr partners lp lsb industries inc and cf industries are all large north americanbased producers of nitrogen fertilizer products additionally iowa fertilizer company and yara

including some with lower natural gas or other feedstock costs  table of contents terra nitrogen company lp seasonality the fertilizer business is seasonal however the sales pattern of our business can change significantly from year to year due to weather conditions and other factors impacting the agricultural industry the strongest demand for our products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest wholesale buyers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns environmental and other regulatory matters we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including laws and regulations relating to land reclamation the generation treatment storage disposal and handling of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of hazardous substance releases these laws include the clean air act the clean water act the resource conservation and recovery

subject to greenhouse gas ghg regulations the united states environmental protection agency epa has issued federal ghg regulations that impact our facility including a mandatory ghg reporting rule that required us to commence monitoring ghg emissions beginning on january   and begin reporting the previous years emissions annually starting in  in addition if we seek to modify or expand our facility and as a result are required to obtain a prevention of significant deterioration psd air construction permit we could be subject to pollution control requirements applicable to ghgs in addition to requirements applicable to conventional air pollutants such requirements may result in increased costs or delays in completing such facility modifications and expansions on december    countries including the united states adopted by consensus a new international agreement known as the paris agreement the paris agreement is intended to provide a framework pursuant to which the parties to the agreement will attempt to hold the increase in global average temperatures to below  °c above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to  °c above preindustrial levels the paris agreement has been accepted by the united states and went into effect in november  however as a result of the recent presidential election the united states may decide to withdraw from the paris agreement or the united nations framework convention on climate change which would also result in withdrawal from the paris agreement or prior to taking such actions could disregard its commitments under the paris agreement the impact of such actions if they take place on the future implementation of the  table of contents terra nitrogen company lp paris agreement is uncertain if the paris agreement remains in effect it could result in more aggressive efforts to reduce ghg emissions there are substantial uncertainties as to the nature stringency and timing of any future regulations more stringent ghg limitations if they are enacted are likely to have a significant impact on us because our production facility emits ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and because natural gas a fossil fuel is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our costs for or limit the availability of energy raw materials

constructed reconstructed or modified nitric acid plants the regulations will apply to our nitric acid plants if and when we undertake activities or operations that are considered modifications including physical changes that would allow us to increase our production capacity at the plants the regulations include certain provisions that could make it difficult for us to meet the limits on emissions of nitrogen oxides nox notwithstanding pollution controls we may add to our plants and accordingly the regulations could impact our ability to expand production at our existing plants the

carefully consider the factors discussed below before deciding to invest in tnclps common units these risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders risks related to our business we are wholly dependent on our verdigris manufacturing facility and any operational disruption could result in a reduction of sales volumes and could cause us to incur substantial expenditures our manufacturing operations located at a single site in verdigris oklahoma are subject to significant operating hazards and interruptions any significant curtailment of production at one or more of our production units could result in materially reduced revenues and cash flows for the duration of any shutdown operations at our manufacturing facility could be curtailed or partially or completely shut down temporarily or permanently as the result of a number of circumstances most of which are not within our control such as unscheduled maintenance or catastrophic events like a major accident or fire damage by severe weather or other natural disaster or sabotage or terrorist incidents the manufacturing operations at our facility could also be subject to interruption if our ammonia storage facilities were to be removed from service due to damage from an accident or natural disaster or sabotage or terrorist incidents or due to problems discovered during inspections associated with longterm maintenance or safety requirements our business is cyclical resulting in periods of industry oversupply during which our financial condition results of operations cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders tend to be negatively affected historically selling prices for our products have fluctuated in response to periodic changes in supply and demand conditions demand is affected by planted acreage and fertilizer application rates driven by population growth changes in dietary habits and nonfood usage of crops such as the production of ethanol and other biofuels among other things supply is affected by available capacity and operating rates raw material costs and availability government policies and global trade periods of strong demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins tend to stimulate global investment in production capacity the construction of new nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing capacity in the industry plus improvements to increase output from the existing production assets increase nitrogen supply and affect the supply and demand balance in recent years fertilizer producers including cf industries have built new production facilities or expanded capacity of existing production assets or announced plans to do so in the current environment global nitrogen fertilizer supply has increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand creating a global nitrogen fertilizer oversupply leading to lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices lower global production costs driven by lower feedstock costs and foreign exchange rate changes and reduced ocean freight costs have further contributed to the lower priced environment in  selling prices reached multiyear lows last seen in  the average selling price for our products in  was  per ton compared to  per ton in  a decrease of    additional production capacity has recently come on line including capacity from cf industries’ expansion projects and more production capacity is expected to come on line over the next  months we cannot predict the extent to which the current oversupply environment global or local economic and financial conditions or changes in such conditions or other factors may cause delays cancellation or acceleration of other announced andor ongoing projects we expect the lower priced environment to continue until global supply and demand become more balanced through a combination of continued demand growth and supply reductions as producers respond to lower realized margins by taking higher cost production facilities off line during periods of industry oversupply our financial condition results of operations cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders tend to be affected negatively as the price at which we sell our products typically declines resulting in possible reduced profit margins writedowns in the value of our inventory and temporary or permanent curtailments of production our financial performance the amount of our cash distributions and the trading price for our common units have been negatively impacted by the lower selling prices resulting from the current global oversupply of nitrogen fertilizer the period of time that these conditions will persist and the degree to which they will impact our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions are uncertain  table of contents terra nitrogen company lp our products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other fertilizer producers we are subject to intense price competition from our competitors most fertilizers are global commodities with little or no product differentiation and customers make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality we compete with many producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities consolidation in the industry has increased and future consolidation is expected to further increase the resources of several of our competitors for example in september  our competitors agrium inc and potash corporation of saskatchewan inc announced plans to merge some of our competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from fertilizer sales which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities furthermore certain governments as owners of some of our competitors may be willing to accept lower prices and profitability on their products in order to support domestic employment or other political or social goals our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships china the worlds largest producer and consumer of nitrogen fertilizers currently has significant capacity surplus and many highcost plants as a result the domestic nitrogen industry in china is operating at low rates if chinese government policy devaluation of the chinese renminbi or decreases in chinese producers underlying costs such as the price of chinese coal encourage increased production capacity utilization the resulting export volume could adversely affect the balance between global supply and demand and may put downward pressure on global fertilizer prices which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders a decline in us agricultural production or limitations on the use of our products for agricultural purposes could materially adversely affect the demand for our products conditions in the us agricultural industry significantly impact our operating results the us agricultural industry can be affected by a number of factors including weather patterns and field conditions current and projected grain inventories and prices domestic and international demand for us agricultural products and us and foreign policies regarding trade in agricultural products these factors are outside of our control state and federal governmental policies including farm and biofuel subsidies and commodity support programs as well as the prices of fertilizer products may also directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the mix of crops planted and the use of fertilizers for particular agricultural applications ethanol production in the united states contributes significantly to corn demand due in part to federal legislation mandating use of renewable fuels an increase in ethanol production has led to an increase in the amount of corn grown in the united states and to increased fertilizer usage on both corn and other crops that have also benefited from improved farm economics while the current renewable fuel standard rfs encourages continued high levels of cornbased ethanol production a continuing food versus fuel debate and other factors have resulted in calls to eliminate or reduce the renewable fuel mandate or to eliminate or reduce cornbased ethanol as part of the renewable fuel mandate this could have an adverse effect on cornbased ethanol production planted corn acreage and fertilizer demand developments in crop technology such as nitrogen fixation the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into compounds that plants can assimilate or nitrogenefficient varieties could also reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and adversely affect the demand for our products widespread adoption of emerging application technologies could disrupt traditional application practices affecting the volume or types of products used and timing of applications in addition from time to time various state legislatures have considered limitations on the use and application of chemical fertilizers due to concerns about the impact of these products on the environment any reduction in the demand for chemical fertilizer products including any limitation on the use and application of chemical fertilizer could affect the demand for our products which could have a material adverse

fertilizer products to affiliates of the general partner at prices determined based on market prices for our fertilizer products as defined in the services and offtake agreement the price of natural gas in north america and worldwide has been volatile in recent years and has declined on average due in part to the development of significant natural gas reserves including shale gas and the rapid improvement in shale gas extraction techniques such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling future production of natural gas from shale formations could be reduced by regulatory changes that restrict drilling or hydraulic fracturing or increase its cost or by reduction in oil exploration and development prompted by lower oil prices and resulting in production of less associated gas additionally increased demand for natural gas particularly in the gulf coast region due to increased industrial demand and increased natural gas exports could result in increased natural gas prices if such reduced production or increased demand were to occur or if other developments adversely impact the supplydemand balance for natural gas in the united states or elsewhere natural gas prices could

construct new facilities or expand our existing operations future regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders we are subject to ghg regulations there are substantial uncertainties as to the

provide a framework pursuant to which the parties to the agreement will attempt to hold the increase in global average temperatures to below  °c above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to  °c above preindustrial levels the paris agreement has been accepted by the united states and went into effect in november  however as a result of the recent presidential election the united states may decide to withdraw from the paris agreement or the united nations framework convention on climate change which would  table of contents terra nitrogen

the future implementation of the paris agreement is uncertain if the paris agreement remains in effect it could result in more aggressive efforts to reduce ghg emissions more stringent ghg limitations if they are enacted are likely to have a significant impact on us because our production facility emits ghgs such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide and because natural gas a fossil fuel is a primary raw material used in our nitrogen production process regulation of ghgs may require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency limit

our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders in addition to the extent that ghg restrictions are not imposed in countries where our competitors operate or are less stringent than regulations that may be imposed in the united states our competitors may have cost or other competitive advantages over us our operating results fluctuate due to seasonality the fertilizer business is seasonal however the sales pattern of our business can change significantly from year to year due to weather conditions and other factors impacting the agricultural industry the strongest demand for fertilizer products occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest wholesale buyers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons seasonality is greatest for ammonia due to the short application season and the limited ability of our customers and their customers to store significant quantities of this product the seasonality of fertilizer demand generally results in sales volumes and net sales being the highest during the spring and working capital requirements being the highest just prior to the start of the spring planting season as a result of this seasonality you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance in addition as a consequence of our seasonality our available cash for distributions can be volatile and will vary quarterly and annually our business is subject to risks involving derivatives including the risk that our hedging activities might not prevent losses we often utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our financial exposure to the price volatility of natural gas the principal raw material used in the production of nitrogenbased fertilizers we have used fixedprice physical purchase and sales contracts futures financial swaps and option contracts traded in the overthecounter markets or on exchanges our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized marktomarket adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives that do not qualify for or to which we do not apply hedge accounting to the extent that our derivative positions lose value we may be required to post collateral with our counterparties adversely affecting our liquidity and our ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders hedging arrangements are imperfect and unhedged risks will always exist in addition our hedging activities may themselves give rise to various risks that could adversely affect us for example we are exposed to counterparty credit risk when our derivatives are in a net asset position the counterparties to our derivatives are multinational commercial banks major financial institutions or large energy companies we monitor the derivative portfolio and credit quality of our counterparties and adjust the level of activity we conduct with individual counterparties as necessary we also manage the credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties credit limits credit monitoring procedures cash collateral requirements and master netting arrangements however our liquidity and cash available for distributions to unitholders could be negatively impacted by a counterparty default on settlement of one or more of our derivative financial instruments our limited access to capital in a time of need could materially adversely impact our business we invest capital in our business to comply with environmental health and safety regulations and policies maintain our manufacturing assets improve our production capabilities and capitalize on growth opportunities the primary source of capital invested in our business is cash from operations in the event that cash generated from operations is insufficient to fund capital investments we would need to obtain additional funding in the form of loans or equity our ability to obtain such funding would be determined by market conditions at the time of the capital need our partnership structure our reliance on a single manufacturing facility in verdigris oklahoma and our reliance on affiliates of the general partner as our only customer could impede our ability to obtain such capital which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations liquidity and ability to pay cash distributions to

improve chemical facility safety in coordination with owners and operators governmental entities could implement new or impose more stringent regulations affecting the security of our plants terminals

could adversely affect our business in the following ways among others conditions in the credit markets could affect the ability of cf industries customers and their customers to obtain sufficient credit to support their operations and the failure of certain key suppliers could increase our exposure to disruptions in supply or to financial losses we also may experience declining demand and falling prices for some of our products due to cf industries customers reluctance to replenish inventories changes in global economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such changes can be difficult to ascertain resulting in anxiety among market participants that can persist for protracted periods for example concern and uncertainty over the potential impact on the global economy of the referendum in the united kingdom in june  which resulted in a vote in favor of exiting the european union has resulted in increased volatility in the global financial markets the overall impact of changes in global economic conditions on us is difficult to predict and our business could be materially adversely impacted in addition conditions in the international market for nitrogen fertilizers significantly influence our operating results the international market for fertilizers is influenced by such factors as currency exchange rates including the relative value of the us dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing of nitrogen fertilizers into the united states foreign agricultural policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange

the anticipated aftertax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on tnclp being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes to maintain tnclps status as a

code of  as amended the code we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the internal revenue service the irs on this or any other matter affecting us if tnclp were to be treated as a corporation in any taxable year its income gains losses deductions and credits would be reflected on its tax return rather than being passed through to unitholders and its net income would be taxed at corporate rates in addition distributions made to unitholders would be treated as dividend income to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits and in the absence of earnings and profits as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of a unitholders basis in his units or as capital gain after a unitholders basis in his units has been reduced to zero if the irs were to

interpretation at any time on january   the irs issued final regulations on the types of income and activities that constitute or generate qualifying income of a mlp for calendar year mlps the effective date of the regulations is january   the regulations have the effect of limiting the types of income and activities that qualify under the mlp rules subject to certain transition provisions the regulations define the activities that generate qualifying income from certain processing or refining and transportation activities with respect to any mineral or natural resource including fertilizer as activities that generate qualifying income but the regulations reserve on specifics regarding fertilizerrelated activities however the irs has issued a private letter ruling to a taxpayer in the fertilizer industry unrelated to tnclp which would indicate that each taxpayers fertilizer manufacturing activities should produce qualifying income for purposes of determining whether  of the partnerships gross income is qualifying income the entity to which this private letter ruling was issued would appear to operate a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing business that is similar to ours  while this private letter ruling provides some insight into the manner in which the irs analyzed fertilizer manufacturing activities at the time this ruling was issued this private letter ruling is specific to a different entity thus the irs is not bound to follow it in respect of tnclp nor may we rely on it as precedent when determining whether we satisfy the mlp  gross income test any change in the federal income tax treatment of income from fertilizerrelated activities as qualifying income could have a material impact on the taxation of the partnership and could have a material adverse impact on unitholder distributions our unitholders will be required to pay taxes on their share of tnclp income even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us a unitholder is required to pay us federal income tax and in certain cases state and local income taxes on its allocable share of tnclps income whether or not such unitholder receives cash distributions from us no assurance is given that our unitholders will receive cash distributions equal to their allocable share of taxable income from us we prorate our items of income gain loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of units as of the close of business on the last day of the preceding month instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred we prorate our items of income and loss between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units as of the close of business on the last day of the preceding month instead of the date a particular unit is transferred as a result of this monthly allocation a unitholder transferring units may be allocated income gain loss deduction and credit recognized after the transfer the use of these proration methods may not be permitted under existing treasury regulations promulgated under the code treasury regulations if the irs were to challenge this method or new treasury regulations regarding allocation methods were issued we may be required to change the allocation of items of income gain loss and deduction among our unitholders tax gain or loss on disposition of our units could be more or less than expected if a unitholder sells its units for income tax purposes the unitholder will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and that unitholders adjusted tax basis in those units because distributions in excess of a unitholders allocable share of our net taxable income decrease that unitholders tax basis in its units the amount if any of such prior excess distributions with respect to the units sold will in effect become taxable income allocated to that unitholder if the unitholder sells such units at a price greater than that unitholders tax basis in those units even if the price received is less than the original cost furthermore a portion of the amount realized whether or not representing gain may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items including depreciation recapture in addition because the amount realized may include a unitholders

individual retirement accounts known as iras and nonus persons raises issues unique to them for example substantially all of our income allocated to organizations exempt from us federal income tax including iras pension plans and other retirement plans and arrangements will constitute unrelated business taxable income and may be taxable to such unitholders distributions to nonus persons will be reduced by withholding taxes imposed at the highest applicable effective tax rate and nonus persons will be required to file us federal income tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income any taxexempt entity  table of contents terra nitrogen company lp or nonus person should consult its tax advisor before investing in our units any taxexempt entity or nonus person who currently holds our units should consult with their tax advisor as to the us federal and state tax consequences of their holding of our units including the taxability of income andor distributions to them we treat each purchaser of our units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual units purchased the irs may challenge this treatment which could adversely affect the value of our units because we cannot match transferors and transferees of our units and to maintain the uniformity of the economic and tax characteristics of our common units we have adopted depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing treasury regulations a successful irs challenge to these positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to a unitholder or the value of our common units the sale or exchange of  or more of our capital and profits interests during any twelvemonth period will result in a termination of tnclp for federal income tax purposes tnclp and the operating partnership will be considered to have constructively terminated for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of  or more of the total interests in tnclp capital and profits within a month period for purposes of determining whether the  threshold has been met multiple sales of the same interest are counted only once because cf industries currently owns approximately  of the outstanding common units and all of the outstanding class b common units of tnclp a sale or exchange of all or a substantial portion of cf industries interests in tnclp including sales or transfers to affiliates of cf industries when combined with trading in the open market may constitute a sale or exchange of  or more of the total interest in tnclp a constructive termination would among other things result in the closing of tnclps taxable year for all unitholders and could result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income in the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than a calendar year the closing of a tax year of tnclp may also result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being included in such unitholders taxable income for the year of termination termination could also subject us to penalties if we are unable to determine that a termination occurred and therefore failed to make necessary elections in a timely manner a unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale may be considered as having disposed of those units if so the unitholder would no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition because a unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units the unitholder may no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition moreover during the period of the loan to the short seller any of our income gain loss or deduction with respect to those units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those units could be fully taxable as ordinary income unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners should modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their units as a result of investing in our units a unitholder may become subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in jurisdictions where we operate or own or acquire

conditions our products are global commodities and are subject to price competition the customers for our products make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality the selling prices of our products fluctuate in response to global market conditions and changes in supply and demand in the current environment global nitrogen fertilizer supply has increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand creating the current global oversupply of nitrogen fertilizer and leading to lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices our  results were impacted by excess global nitrogen supply and the resulting low nitrogen fertilizer selling prices the us gulf is a major global fertilizer pricing point due to the volume of nitrogen fertilizer that trades there through most of  nitrogen pricing at the us gulf declined often trading below parity with other international pricing points due to low us import demand seasonal decreases in agricultural demand combined with delayed customer purchasing activity resulted in nitrogen fertilizer selling prices reaching multiyear lows last seen in  in the second half of the year our average selling prices for ammonia and uan declined by  and   respectively as compared to   which reduced both our net sales and gross margin in  by  million  in addition during periods of declining prices customers tend to delay purchasing fertilizer in anticipation of prices in the future being lower than current prices customers and farmers delayed purchasing through most of  in response to lower selling prices which reduced inventory levels in the supply chain increases in demand for the  spring application caused higher pricing as  ended as customers began taking deliveries in anticipation of the spring application season a significant amount of new nitrogen production capacity came on line in  and additional production capacity is expected to come on line in  including a significant increase in capacity located in north america this new capacity will further increase supply we expect nitrogen fertilizer prices to rise going into the  spring application season due to seasonal demand however we expect the lower priced environment to continue until global supply and demand become more balanced through a combination of continued demand growth and supply reductions as producers respond to lower realized margins by taking higher cost production facilities off line  table of contents terra nitrogen company lp results of operations consolidated results we reported net

a master limited partnership mlp partnerships are generally not subject to federal income tax although publiclytraded partnerships such as tnclp are treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes and therefore are subject to federal income tax unless at least  of the partnerships gross income is qualifying income as defined in section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended and the partnership is not required to register as an investment company under the investment company act of  as we currently satisfy the requirements to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes no federal income taxes are paid by the partnership on january   the internal revenue service irs issued final regulations on the types of income and activities that constitute or generate qualifying income of a mlp for calendar year mlps the effective date of the regulations is january   the regulations have the effect of limiting the types of income and activities that qualify under the mlp rules subject to certain transition provisions the regulations define the activities that generate qualifying income from certain processing or refining and transportation activities with respect to any mineral or natural resource including fertilizer as activities that generate qualifying income but the regulations reserve on specifics regarding fertilizerrelated activities however the irs has issued a private letter ruling to a taxpayer in the fertilizer industry unrelated to tnclp which would indicate that each taxpayers fertilizer manufacturing activities should produce qualifying income for purposes of determining whether  of the partnerships gross income is qualifying income the entity to which this private letter ruling was issued would appear to operate a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing business that is similar to ours  while this private letter ruling provides some insight into the manner in which the irs analyzed fertilizer manufacturing activities at the time this ruling was issued this private letter ruling is specific to a different entity thus the irs is not bound to follow it in respect of tnclp nor may we rely on it as precedent when determining whether we satisfy the mlp  gross income test any change in the federal income tax treatment of income from fertilizerrelated activities as qualifying income could have a material impact on the taxation of the partnership and could have a material adverse impact on unitholder distributions we continue to monitor these irs regulatory activities  table of contents terra nitrogen

current operating plans historical price activity and selling prices expected to be realized if the carrying amount of our inventories exceeds its estimated market value we immediately adjust our carrying values accordingly upon inventory liquidation if the actual sales prices are less than our most recent estimate of market value additional losses would be recorded in the period of liquidation fixed production costs related to idle capacity are not included in the cost of inventories but are charged directly to cost of sales in the period incurred property plant and equipment property plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciation and amortization are computed using the straightline method over the useful lives of the assets the useful lives used in computing depreciation and amortization expenses are based on estimates of the period over which the assets will be of economic benefit to us useful lives are based on historical experience manufacturers or engineering estimates valuation or appraisal estimates and future business plans we review the useful lives assigned to our property plant and equipment on a periodic basis and change our estimates to reflect the results of those reviews  table of contents terra nitrogen company lp scheduled inspections replacements and overhauls of machinery and equipment at our continuous process manufacturing facility during a full plant shutdown are referred to as plant turnarounds we account for plant turnarounds under the deferral method as opposed to the direct expense or builtin overhaul methods under the deferral method expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized in property plant and equipment when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straightline basis over the period benefited which is until the next scheduled turnaround in up to  years should the estimated period between turnarounds change we may be required to amortize the remaining cost of the turnaround over a shorter period which would lead to higher depreciation and amortization costs if we used the direct expense method turnaround costs would be expensed as incurred scheduled replacements and overhauls of plant and equipment include the dismantling repair or replacement and installation of various components including piping valves motors turbines pumps compressors heat exchangers and the replacement of catalyst when a full plant shutdown occurs scheduled inspections are also conducted during a full plant shutdown including required safety inspections which entail the disassembly of various components such as steam boilers pressure vessels and other equipment requiring safety certifications capitalized turnaround costs have been applied consistently in the periods presented internal employee costs and overhead amounts are not considered turnaround costs and are not capitalized turnaround costs are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows recoverability of longlived assets we review the carrying values of our property plant and equipment and other longlived assets in accordance with us gaap in order to assess recoverability factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include sales volume selling prices raw material costs operating expenses inflation discount rates exchange rates and capital spending significant judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors which include inherent uncertainties the factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process the recoverability of the values associated with our longlived assets is dependent upon future operating performance certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer business adverse changes in demand for our products increase in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our review the recoverability and impairment tests of longlived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recent accounting pronouncements see notes to the consolidated financial statements note  —new accounting standards for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements item a    quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of changes in the price of natural gas which we use in the manufacture of our nitrogen fertilizer products because natural gas prices are volatile we manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments the derivative instruments that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and options these contracts settle using nymex futures prices which represent the basis for fair value at any given time the derivatives are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated natural gas purchases during those future periods as of december   and   we had open natural gas derivative contracts for  million mmbtus and  million mmbtus respectively a  per mmbtu increase in the forward curve prices of natural gas as of december   would result in a favorable change in the fair value of these derivative positions by  million  and a  per mmbtu decrease would change their fair value

although publicly traded partnerships such as tnclp are treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes and therefore are subject to federal income tax unless at least  of the partnerships gross income is qualifying income as defined in section  of the internal revenue code of  as amended and the partnership is not required to register as an investment company under the investment company act of  as we currently satisfy the requirements to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes no federal income taxes are paid by the partnership on january   the internal revenue service irs issued final regulations on the types of income and activities that constitute or generate qualifying income of a mlp for calendar year mlps the effective date of the regulations is january   the regulations have the effect of limiting the types of income and activities that qualify under the mlp rules subject to certain transition provisions the regulations define the activities that generate qualifying income from certain processing or refining and transportation activities with respect to any mineral or natural resource including fertilizer as activities that generate qualifying income but the regulations reserve on specifics regarding fertilizerrelated activities however the irs has issued a private letter ruling to a taxpayer in the fertilizer industry unrelated to tnclp which would indicate that each taxpayers fertilizer manufacturing activities should produce qualifying income for purposes of determining whether  of the partnerships gross income is qualifying income the entity to which this private letter ruling was issued would appear to operate a nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing business that is similar to ours  while this private letter ruling provides some insight into the manner in which the irs analyzed fertilizer manufacturing activities at the time this ruling was issued this private letter ruling is specific to a different entity thus the irs is not bound to follow it in respect of tnclp nor may we rely on it as precedent when determining whether we satisfy the mlp  gross income test any change in the federal income tax treatment of income from fertilizerrelated activities as qualifying income could have a material impact on the taxation of the partnership and could have a material adverse impact on unitholder

property plant and equipment the assumptions used in the evaluation of potential impairments of property plant and equipment and the allowances for doubtful accounts receivable revenue recognition the basic criteria necessary for revenue recognition are  evidence that a sales arrangement exists  delivery of goods has occurred  the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and  collectability is reasonably assured the title and risk of loss passes to an affiliate of the general partner as the product is shipped from the plant gate we recognize revenue when these criteria have been met and when title and risk of loss have been transferred to an affiliate of the general partner cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that

volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers the derivatives that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and options traded in the overthecounter otc markets the derivative contract prices are based on nymex future prices based on physical delivery of natural gas at the henry hub in louisiana the most common and financially liquid location of reference for derivative financial instruments related to natural gas however we purchase natural gas for our manufacturing facility from suppliers whose prices are based primarily on the oneok index based on physical delivery of natural gas in oklahoma rather than at the henry hub this creates a location basis differential between the derivative contract price and the price we pay for physical delivery of natural gas accordingly the prices underlying the derivative financial instruments we use may not exactly match the prices of natural gas we purchase and consume we enter into natural gas derivative contracts with respect to gas to be consumed by us in the future and settlements of those derivative contracts are scheduled to coincide with our anticipated purchases of natural gas used to manufacture nitrogen products during those future periods we use natural gas derivatives as an economic hedge of gas price risk but without the application of hedge accounting we report derivatives on

purchases through december  for the year ended december    we used derivatives to cover approximately  of our natural gas consumption the counterparties to our derivative contracts are multinational commercial banks major financial institutions and large energy companies the derivatives are executed with several counterparties generally under international swaps and derivatives association isda agreements the isda agreements are master netting arrangements commonly used for otc derivatives that mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk in part by creating contractual rights of netting and setoff the specifics of which vary from agreement to agreement these rights are described further below • settlement netting generally allows the parties to net into a single net payable or receivable ordinary settlement obligations arising under the isda agreement on the same day in the same currency for the same types of derivative instruments and through the same pairing of offices • closeout netting rights are provided in the event of a default or other termination event as defined in the isda agreements including bankruptcy depending on the cause of early termination the nondefaulting party may elect to terminate all or some transactions outstanding under the isda agreement the values of all terminated transactions and certain other payments under the isda agreement are netted resulting in a single net closeout amount payable to or by the nondefaulting party termination values may be determined using a marktomarket approach or based on a partys good faith estimate of its loss if the final net closeout amount is payable by the nondefaulting party that partys obligation to make the payment may be conditioned on factors such as the termination of all derivative transactions between the parties or payment in full of all of the defaulting partys obligations to the nondefaulting party in each case regardless of whether arising under the isda agreement or otherwise • setoff rights are provided by certain of the isda agreements and generally allow a nondefaulting party to elect to set off against the final net closeout payment other matured and contingent amounts payable between the parties under the isda agreement or otherwise typically these setoff rights arise upon the early termination of all transactions outstanding under an isda agreement following a default or specified termination event  table of contents terra nitrogen company lp most of the isda agreements contain creditriskrelated contingent features such as crossdefault provisions and credit support thresholds that are dependent upon the credit ratings of the general partner affiliate in the event of certain defaults or a credit ratings downgrade of the general partner affiliate the counterparty may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require the general partner affiliate to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position the general partner affiliate’s revolving credit agreement at any time when it is secured provides a cross collateral feature for those derivatives that are with counterparties that are party to or affiliates of parties to the revolving credit agreement so that no separate collateral would be required for those counterparties in connection with such derivatives in the event the general partner affiliates revolving credit agreement becomes unsecured the general partner affiliate could be required to post separate collateral in connection with such derivatives as of december   and   the aggregate fair value of derivative instruments with creditriskrelated contingent features in net liability positions was  million and  million  respectively which also approximates the fair value of the maximum amount of assets needed to settle the obligations if the creditriskrelated contingent features were triggered and the general partner affiliate was unable to post collateral at

measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis that is the assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances such as when there is evidence of impairment these include longlived assets that may be written down to fair value as a result of impairment we determined that these fair value measurements rely primarily on

believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at this facility which is necessary in order to estimate fair value in reaching this conclusion we considered the historical performance of the facility and have taken into account factors such as planned maintenance asset replacements and upgrades of plant and equipment which if conducted as in the past can extend the physical lives of the facility indefinitely we also considered the possibility of changes in technology risk of obsolescence and availability of raw materials

directors of tngp are required by sec regulations to furnish the partnership with copies of reports of ownership and changes in ownership of our common units they file based solely on a review of the

managed by the general partner tngp the executive officers of which are officers of cf industries or its subsidiaries cf industries indirectly owns approximately  of the outstanding common units and all of the outstanding class b common units representing our limited partnership interests and cf industries is also the indirect  owner of tngp the executive officers of tngp are provided compensation and benefits directly from subsidiaries of cf industries the compensation committee of the board of directors of cf industries is responsible for the compensation decisions relating to the executive officers of tngp the tngp board of directors does not have a compensation committee and does not make any decisions with respect to the compensation of tngps executive officers for more discussion regarding the compensation provided to the executive officers of tngp by cf industries see the schedule a definitive proxy statement of cf industries which will be filed with the sec when available the proxy statement since neither tnclp nor tngp provides any compensation directly to tngps executive officers and neither has any involvement in determining their compensation we have concluded that a discussion of the compensation awarded to earned by and paid to tngps named executive officers as contemplated by item b of regulation sk would not be meaningful therefore our compensation discussion and analysis does not resemble that of most public companies instead we think it is more meaningful to describe the arrangement pursuant to which we receive services from cf industries since we have no executive officers or employees all employmentrelated functions including production planning manufacturing management logistics accounting legal risk management investor relations and other general and administrative functions are provided to us by employees of subsidiaries of cf industries we reimburse subsidiaries of cf industries for a portion of the compensation expenses incurred with respect to tngps executive officers and other employees of cf industries and its affiliates who provide services to us compensation expenses for production and manufacturing services are charged directly to us based on actual costs compensation expenses for selling general and administrative related functions including the compensation of the tngps executive officers are reimbursed based on a quarterly fixed fee arrangement further discussion of our arrangements with subsidiaries of cf industries can be found in note  —related party transactions  of the notes to the

officers and the tngp board of directors serves as tnclps governing body tngp does not have a compensation committee therefore the full tngp board of directors reviewed and discussed the compensation

score it earned on the first assessment it went through in  the seeds of a slowdown were scarcely evident then but theyve become hard to miss today as all of terras key metrics have dropped to lower growth rates  and in the case of dividend payouts have actually declined  earning the fertilizer mlp a decent but not great four out of eight passing grades commodity mlps must often contend with economic forces beyond their control but can terra regain its footing and again become the dividend darling it once was lets dig deeper to find out investors have had to deal with an unusually high degree of volatility from terra over the past two quarters which is undoubtedly frustrating after the stock became the secondbest stock of an entire decade following the dotcom crash  it was a bagger from  to  fool writer bob ciura among others has highlighted the fact that terra is subject to a number of different factors it simply cant control from the cost of its naturalgas inputs to the conditions out on the farms where its fertilizer is put to work while ammoniabased fertilizer prices now seem to be stabilizing after last years plunge terra still has to grapple with natural gas prices that remain nearly  higher today than they were two years ago henry hub natural gas spot price data by ycharts the net effect of this has been to smash profit margins for major natural gas fertilizer makers on this measure at least terra has held up far better than its close competitor rentech nitrogen partners nysernf which has endured a steep collapse in profit margins into the red over the past two years tnh profit margin ttm data by ycharts the drop in ammonia fertilizer prices has also hit cvr partners nyseuan hard on the bottom line even though its primary input  petroleum coke  is derived from raw material that has not endured the same price growth the price of a barrel of oil based on the west texas intermediate price has grown about  in the past two years the only related fertilizer company to not endure similar drops in the latest quarter cf industries nysecf is likely to see its trailing month profit margins shrink again over the course of the year as the onetime impact of the recent sale of its phosphatefertilizer business moves further into the past in fact when we examine gross margins instead cfs profitmargin performance over the past two years is already worse than all but rentechs as a result all of terras mlp fertilizer peers have slashed their dividend payouts over the past two years cvr partners payout is  below what it was in  and rentechs is a fraction of the dollarplus quarterly payouts it boasted two years ago cf which isnt a mlp had the wiggle room to boost its payouts a year ago but its yield is still the lowest of the pack to drive home the point of these data points fool energy specialist matt dilallo points out the inherent hazards of investing in tightly focused mlps with variable payouts particularly when as in terras case their primary asset is tied to the cost of a single input processed at a single location he notes that such mlps shouldnt form the core of any retirement portfolios and its hard to disagree in this instance since terra seems to have reached the limits of its oncemeteoric growth putting the pieces together today terra nitrogen has some of the qualities that make up a great stock

nitrogen co l p de  k    business   part i   item    business   general   terra nitrogen company lp tnclp we our or us is a delaware limited partnership that produces and distributes nitrogen fertilizer products our principal products are anhydrous ammonia or ammonia and urea ammonium nitrate solutions uan which we manufacture at our facility in verdigris oklahoma   we conduct our operations through an operating partnership terra nitrogen limited partnership tnlp or the operating partnership and collectively with tnclp the partnership terra nitrogen gp inc tngp or general partner a delaware corporation is the general partner of both tnclp and tnlp and owns a consolidated  interest in the partnership the general partner is an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of terra industries inc terra a maryland corporation terra is a leading north american producer and marketer of nitrogen products serving agricultural and industrial markets    overview   the north american nitrogen industry experienced substantial growth in  earnings due to higher product prices in response to increased demand for nitrogen products as inputs for key commodities including corn and wheat and combined with relatively stable natural gas prices   business overview   we produce and distribute nitrogen products which are used primarily by farmers to improve the yield and quality of their crops our product sales are heavily weighted toward uan and all of our products are sold on a wholesale basis although ammonia and uan are often interchangeable each has its own characteristics and customer product preferences vary according to the crop planted soil and weather conditions regional farming practices relative prices and the cost and availability of appropriate storage handling and application equipment   financial information about our business is included in item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in item  financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k   our products   overview   one of the principal forms of globally traded nitrogen fertilizer is ammonia uan is used principally in north america and has only recently been traded in international markets uans high water content and need for transportation in tankers can cause transportation costs per unit of nitrogen to be higher than for other forms of internationally traded nitrogen products the location of our sole production facility in verdigris oklahoma provides us a competitive advantage in serving agricultural customers in the central and southern plains and the corn belt regions of the united states we do not sell our products internationally    our nitrogen products and  production are described in greater detail below   urea ammonium nitrate solutions uan   uan is a liquid fertilizer and unlike ammonia is odorless and does not require refrigeration or pressurization for transportation or storage uan is produced by combining liquid urea liquid ammonium nitrate an and water the nitrogen content of uan ranges from  to  by weight unless we state otherwise all references to uan assume a  nitrogen content because of its high water content uan is relatively expensive to transport making it largely a regionally distributed product   uan can be applied to crops directly or mixed with crop protection products permitting the application of several materials simultaneously reducing energy and labor costs and accelerating field preparation for planting uan may be applied from ordinary tanks and trucks and sprayed or injected into the soil or applied through irrigation systems in addition uan may be applied throughout the growing season providing significant application flexibility due to its stability uan may be used for notill row crops where fertilizer is spread on the surface of the soil   in  we produced and sold approximately  million tons of uan primarily to us fertilizer dealers and distributors   anhydrous ammonia   ammonia is the simplest form of nitrogen fertilizer and the feedstock for the production of other nitrogen fertilizers including urea an and uan ammonia is produced when natural gas reacts with steam and air at high temperatures and pressures in the presence of catalysts ammonia has a nitrogen content of  by weight and is generally the least expensive form of fertilizer on a perpoundofcontainednitrogen basis although generally the cheapest source of nitrogen available to agricultural customers ammonia can be less desirable to endusers than urea an and uan because of its need for specialized application equipment and its limited application flexibility   in  we produced approximately  million tons of ammonia we sold a total of  million tons of ammonia and consumed approximately  million tons of ammonia as a raw material to manufacture our other nitrogen products   marketing and distribution   we sell our products primarily in the central and southern plains and corn belt regions of the us our sole production facility in verdigris oklahoma is located near the major crop producing and consuming areas of the us and has ready access to barge truck and rail transportation in addition the verdigris facility has an ammonia pipeline to transport product to primary markets our products are marketed and distributed by terra industries inc based in sioux city iowa which provides services to the partnership for further information on the combined organizations of the general partner and our affiliates see note  to item  financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k   all of our sales are at the wholesale level our customers for fertilizer products are dealers national farm retail chains distributors and other fertilizer producers and traders national farm retail chains have both distribution and application capabilities distributors operate as wholesalers and sell directly to dealers and national farm retail chains which in turn sell directly to farmers many dealers maintain yearround storage capacity for inventory as well as application equipment we sell a majority    of our nitrogen fertilizer products to dealers no single customer accounted for more than  of our  sales   transportation   we use several modes of transportation to ship product to customers including railcars common carrier trucks barges and common carrier pipelines railcars are the primary mode of transportation for shipments from our verdigris facilities we utilize railcars that are currently leased by terra for all of its businesses terra currently leases approximately  railcars we also use approximately  liquid and ammonia fertilizer terminal storage facilities in numerous states   we transport purchased natural gas to our verdigris oklahoma facility via an intrastate pipeline this pipeline is not an openaccess carrier but is nonetheless part of a widespread regional system through which verdigris can receive natural gas from any major oklahoma source we also have limited access to outofstate natural gas supplies for this facility   nitrogen industry overview   the three major nutrients required for plant growth are phosphorous mined as phosphate rock potassium mined as potash and nitrogen produced from natural gas phosphorus plays a key role in the photosynthesis process potassium is an important regulator of plants physiological functions nitrogen is an essential element for most organic compounds in plants because it promotes protein formation nitrogen is also a major component of chlorophyll which helps promote green healthy growth and high yields there are no known substitutes for nitrogen fertilizers in the cultivation of highyield crops these three nutrients occur naturally in the soil to a certain extent but must be replaced because crops remove them from the soil nitrogen to a greater extent than phosphate and potash must be reapplied each year in areas of intense agricultural usage because of nitrogen absorption by crops and its tendency to escape from the soil by evaporation or leaching consequently demand for nitrogen fertilizer tends to be more consistent on a yearbyyear peracreplanted basis than is demand for phosphate or potash fertilizer   the major nitrogen consuming crop in north america is corn certain crops such as soybeans and other legumes can better absorb atmospheric nitrogen and do not require nitrogen fertilizers   demand   global demand for fertilizers typically grows at predictable rates and tends to correspond to growth in grain production global fertilizer demand is driven in the long term primarily by population growth increases in disposable income and associated improvements in diet shortterm demand depends on world economic growth rates and factors creating temporary imbalances in supply and demand these factors include weather patterns the level of world grain stocks relative to consumption agricultural commodity prices energy prices crop mix fertilizer application rates farm income and temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade from government intervention such as changes in the buying patterns of china or india grain consumption has historically grown at approximately  per year according to ifa international fertilizer industry association over the last  years global fertilizer demand has grown  annually and global nitrogen fertilizer demand has grown at a faster rate of  annually during that period north american nitrogen fertilizer demand has grown  annually   supply   over the past seven years global ammonia capacity has remained relatively flat growing at an average of  per annum this result was attributable principally to the combination of new project capacity    being offset by permanent plant closings in the us and europe as global operating rates and prices have risen so have plans for new capacity   this anticipated new global capacity will come primarily from advantaged natural gas regions of the world such as the middle east and africa this expansion of capacity could be limited however by high capital and construction costs lower nitrogen prices and increasing natural gas prices russia has increased domestic gas prices as well as prices paid by their export customers this has increased the production costs for new and existing plants in the former soviet union and europe   imports account for a significant portion of us nitrogen product supply producers from the former soviet union canada the middle east trinidad and venezuela are major exporters to the us these export producers are often competitive in regions close to the point of entry for imports primarily the gulf coast and east coast of north america due to higher freight costs and limited distribution infrastructure importers are less competitive in serving the main corngrowing regions of the us which are more distant from these ports according to fertecon a leading industry publication world trade in ammonia grew from  million tons in  to  million tons by  due to the exceptional increase in gas prices in the us and europe during this period and the consequent closure of us capacity   outlook   fertecon forecasts that global nitrogen fertilizer demand is expected to rise by around  per year from  to  increasing by  million tons or close to  over the period in north america nitrogen fertilizer consumption is expected to increase from  to  from  million tons to  million tons a  increase   the continued growth in demand for nitrogen products has helped stabilize global ammonia capacity utilization rates which averaged  between  and  according to fertecon global ammonia utilization rates are forecasted to remain in the low s through  north american ammonia utilization rates are forecast to decrease from  in  to  by  due in part to projected longterm growth in worldwide capacity and in imports   to help meet the growing global demand for fertilizers especially in high growth areas like china and india new ammonia capacity is expected to come on stream globally in the next nine years according to fertecon global ammonia capacity is forecast to increase by  million tons by  a total increase of  this projected additional capacity excludes plants constructed in china as product produced in china is not expected to be distributed in global markets there are a number of new capacity projects expected or underway in gas advantaged regions however increased construction costs and changes in market dynamics have delayed a number of projects   world trade in ammonia is expected to increase by  million tons or  in the period to  according to fertecon representing more modest growth than seen from  to  fertecon projects that higher gas costs for russian and ukrainian exporters and the lowerthanprevious gas price outlook for the us would appear to support continued operating rates for remaining us ammonia capacity limiting the nearterm growth in ammonia imports   seasonality and volatility   the fertilizer business is seasonal based upon the planting growing and harvesting cycles nitrogen fertilizer inventories must be accumulated to permit uninterrupted customer deliveries and require significant storage capacity this seasonality generally results in higher fertilizer prices during peak    consumption periods with prices normally reaching their highest point in the spring decreasing in the summer and increasing again in the fallearly winter period as depleted inventories are restored   the fertilizer business can also be volatile as a result of a number of other factors the most important of these factors are     weather patterns and field conditions particularly during periods of high fertilizer consumption     quantities of fertilizers imported to primary markets     current and projected grain inventories and prices which are heavily influenced by us exports worldwide grain markets and domestic demand food feed and biofuel and     price fluctuations in natural gas the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen fertilizer   governmental policies may directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the level of grain inventories the mix of crops planted and crop prices as well as environmental demands   raw materials   the principal raw material used to produce manufactured nitrogen products is natural gas natural gas costs in  accounted for approximately  of our total costs and expenses significant increases in natural gas costs that are not hedged or recovered through higher selling prices would have an adverse impact on our business financial conditions and results we believe there will be a sufficient supply of natural gas for the foreseeable future we will as opportunities present themselves enter into firm transportation contracts to minimize the risk of interruption or curtailment of natural gas supplies during the peakdemand winter season when we andor our customers generally build inventories in anticipation of the peaksales spring season we use a combination of spot and term purchases of varied duration from a variety of suppliers to obtain natural gas   we use derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our natural gas purchases we have implemented a policy setting boundaries to ensure coverage of fixed forward sales as well as potential outstanding forward priced quotes and prepay programs our policy is designed to hedge exposure to natural gas price fluctuations for production required for forward sales estimates we hedge natural gas prices through the use of supply contracts financial derivatives and other instruments   the settlement dates of forwardpricing contracts coincide with gas purchase dates as well as shipment periods on forward committed sales forwardpricing contracts are based on a specified price referenced to spot market prices or appropriate new york mercantile exchange nymex futures contract prices   competition   nitrogen products are global commodities and our customers include distributors industrial endusers dealers and other fertilizer producers customers make purchasing decisions principally on the delivered price and availability of the product we compete with a number of domestic and foreign producers including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities some of our principal competitors may have greater total resources and may depend less on earnings from nitrogen fertilizer sales some foreign competitors may have access to lower cost or governmentsubsidized natural gas supplies particularly those with facilities in warmer climates natural gas comprises a significant portion of our raw materials cost for nitrogen products competitive natural gas purchasing is essential to maintaining a lowcost product position we compete with other manufacturers of nitrogen products on delivery terms and availability of products as well as on price    environmental and other regulatory matters   our operations are subject to various federal state and local environmental health and safety laws and regulations including laws relating to air quality hazardous and solid wastes and water quality our facilities require operating permits that are subject to review by governmental agencies we are also involved in the manufacture handling transportation storage and disposal of materials that are or may be classified as hazardous or toxic by federal state or other regulatory agencies we take precautions to reduce the likelihood of accidents involving these materials we may be responsible under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or analogous laws for all or part of the costs of such investigation and remediation if such materials have been or are disposed of at sites that are targeted for investigation and remediation by federal or state regulatory authorities freeportmcmoran resource partners limited partnership a former owner and operator of the partnerships production facilities has retained liability for certain environmental matters originating prior to the partnerships acquisition of these facilities   we may be required to install additional air and water quality control equipment such as low nitrogen oxide nox burners scrubbers ammonia sensors and continuous emission monitors at our facility to comply with clean air act clean water act and similar requirements these equipment requirements also typically apply to competitors as well   we endeavor to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental health and safety regulations and have incurred substantial costs in connection with such compliance because these regulations are expected to continue to change and generally to be more restrictive than current requirements the costs of compliance will likely increase we do not expect our compliance with these regulations to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or net cash flows   our capital expenditures related to environmental control in  were approximately  million environmental capital expenditures are projected to be approximately  million in the aggregate for the three years   and  the majority of these expenditures are for voluntary pollution prevention projects   we believe that our policies and procedures now in effect comply with applicable environmental laws and with the permits relating to our facility in all material respects however in the normal course of our business we are exposed to risks relating to possible releases of hazardous substances into the environment such releases could cause substantial damage or injuries although environmental expenditures in  were not material it is impossible to predict or quantify the impact of future environmental liabilities associated with releases of hazardous substances from our facility   employees   tngp the general partner is responsible for managing our business as of december   the general partner had no employees terra nitrogen corporation tnc a

nitrogen company lp    derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are executed on our behalf by an affiliate of the general partner to reduce our exposure to changes in commodity prices for natural gas natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogenbased fertilizers the derivatives that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps and natural gas options traded in the overthecounter otc markets the derivative contract prices are based on nymex future prices based on physical delivery of natural gas at the henry hub in louisiana the most common and financially liquid location of reference for derivative financial instruments related to natural gas however we purchase natural gas for our manufacturing facility from suppliers whose prices are based primarily on the oneok index based on physical delivery of natural gas in oklahoma rather than at the henry hub this creates a location basis differential between the derivative contract price and the price we pay for physical delivery of natural gas accordingly the prices underlying the derivative financial instruments we use may not exactly match the prices of natural gas we purchase and consume we enter into natural gas derivative contracts with respect to gas to be consumed by us in the future and settlement of those derivative contracts are scheduled to coincide with our anticipated purchases of natural gas used to manufacture nitrogen products during those future periods we use natural gas derivatives as an economic hedge of gas price risk but without the application of hedge accounting we report derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value changes in fair value are recognized in cost of goods sold in

institutions and large energy companies the derivatives are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods these contracts settle using nymex futures prices and accordingly to determine the fair value of these instruments we use quoted market prices from nymex and standard pricing models with inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as forward curves supplied by an industryrecognized unrelated third party see note  —derivative financial instruments for additional information assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis we also have assets that may be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis that is the assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances such as when there is evidence of impairment these include longlived assets that may be written down to fair value as a result of impairment we determined that these fair value measurements rely primarily on partnershipspecific inputs and the partnerships assumptions about the use of the assets since certain of the assumptions would involve inputs that are not observable these fair values would reside within level  of the fair value hierarchy      terra nitrogen company lp    property plant and equipment net property plant

—related party transactions  nitrogen fertilizer market conditions our products are global commodities and are subject to price competition the customers for our products make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and to a lesser extent on customer service and product quality the selling prices of our products fluctuate in response to global market conditions and changes in supply and demand in the current environment global nitrogen fertilizer supply has increased faster than global nitrogen fertilizer demand creating the current global oversupply of nitrogen fertilizer and leading to lower selling prices the third quarter and first nine months of  were significantly impacted by declining selling prices our average selling prices for ammonia and uan declined by  and   respectively during the third quarter of  as compared to the third quarter of   which reduced both our net sales and gross margin in the third quarter of  by  million  during the first nine months of   our average selling prices for ammonia and uan declined by  and   respectively which reduced both our net sales and gross margin in the first nine months of  by  million        terra nitrogen company lp   over the past several years strong demand high capacity utilization and increasing operating margins as a result of higher global nitrogen fertilizer prices stimulated global investment in nitrogen production facilities which resulted in an increase in global nitrogen fertilizer production capacity and the current surplus of supply in the market global investment in nitrogen production facilities includes the capacity expansion projects that are being completed by affiliates of our general partner in addition lower global production costs driven by lower feedstock costs and foreign exchange rate changes and reduced ocean freight costs have further contributed to the lower priced environment we expect the lower priced environment to continue until global supply and demand become more balanced through a combination of continued demand growth and supply reductions as producers respond to lower realized margins by taking higher cost
