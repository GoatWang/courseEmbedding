kirchhausen  biberach  horkheim historyedit up to ad edit the oldest traces of humans in and around heilbronn date back to the old stone age  bc the fertile neckar floodplains in the heilbronn basin aided early settlement by farmers and ranchers the city limits of presentday heilbronn contain many sites of bronze age finds later on but still before ad the celts already mined here for salt from brine under roman emperor domitian ad – the romans pushed east away from the rhine and the outer boundary of the roman empire was set at the neckarodenwald limes a castle in todays borough of böckingen was part of that limes and nearby numerous roman villas and plantations were built around ad  the neckarodenwald limes became obsolete when the boundary of the roman empire was moved approximately  km  mi to the east where it was subsequently fortified with the construction of the upper germanic limes complete with parapet and trenches around  the romans surrendered the limes and the alamanni became rulers of the neckar basin between the th and th centuries the area became part of the frankish empire and the first settlement was built in the general vicinity of the present

for a period of time the name heilbrunna healing well hints to a well that is located not far from the basilica in  a significant settlement of jews is noted in official documents and the codex of the monastery in hirsau documented heilbronns right to hold market days and mint coins mentioning its harbor and vineyards as well –edit the deutschhof in  heilbronn was incorporated into the hohenstaufen empire as oppidum heilecbrunnen oppidum signified a city fortified by parapet and trenches later during the th century the teutonic knights obtained ownership of a large area south of heilbronn which would remain owned by that order until german mediatisation in  starting in  the order built the deutschhof there as one of its residences the church building of the order that was located on the premises was modified and expanded several times first in  it was expanded gothic then it was remodeled in  baroque and in  it was consecrated as a cathedral after the demise of the staufen dynasty

first city hall was erected in the market place and the kilianskirche built on the foundation of the michaelsbasilica was expanded the neckar privilege gave the city the right to modify the flow of the river in  which meant it now had the right to construct dams harbors and mills because of the infrastructure thus created during the th century heilbronn grew attractive to merchants and craftspeople who now demanded the right to determine their own fate in  charles iv holy roman emperor issued a new charter to the city now heilbronn needed to answer only to the emperor and as such was an imperial free city craftspeople and merchants were now represented in its council and the villages of böckingen flein frankenbach and neckargartach became part of heilbronns territory as an imperial free city heilbronn was threatened by the ambitious house of württemberg a relationship with the holy roman emperor and a treaty with the electorate of the palatinate in effect from  to

such as the kilianskirche – trace their origins to that era –edit bollwerksturm götz von berlichingen spent three years in knightly custody in heilbronn starting in  and even spent a night in the tower of the bastion that same year people first took note of the pub owner jäcklein rohrbach who with accomplices would later kill the executor of böckingen after he had spent some time in the hohenlohe plains and collected similarly minded characters around him he returned to heilbronn in april  just as the german peasants war was getting into full swing on april  the peasants killed many of the nobles in weinsberg and on april  the heilbronn cloister of the order of our lady of mt carmel was attacked and ransacked the city opened its gates in response to demands of the peasants and consequently more churches and municipal institutions were robbed the next day for about a month heilbronn remained under the control of revolting peasants and even though johann lachmann later a church reformer had attempted to mediate the peasants did not leave the city until one of their armies was defeated on may   in böblingen their leader rohrbach was executed on may   in neckargartach and his home town of böckingen was partially burnt to the ground in punishment in  the replacement of the mayor by hans riesser a protestant brought on the previously delayed reformation and through

humans in and around heilbronn date back to the old stone age  bc the fertile neckar floodplains in the heilbronn basin aided early settlement by farmers and ranchers the city limits of presentday heilbronn contain many sites of bronze age finds later on but still before ad the celts already mined here for salt from brine under roman emperor domitian ad – the romans pushed east away from the rhine and the outer boundary of the roman empire was set at the neckarodenwald limes a castle in todays borough of böckingen was part of that limes and nearby numerous roman villas and plantations were built around ad  the neckarodenwald limes became obsolete when the boundary of the roman empire was moved approximately  km  mi to the east where it was subsequently fortified with the construction of the upper germanic limes complete with parapet and trenches around  the romans surrendered the limes and the alamanni became rulers of the neckar basin between the th and th centuries the area became part of the frankish empire and the first settlement was built in the general vicinity of the present center of town in  heilbronn is first mentioned in an official document of the diocese of würzburg as villa helibrunna together with a michaelsbasilica and in  king louis the german set up court here for a period of time the name heilbrunna healing well hints to a well that is

regal advocate to rule the city in addition to the advocate he put a council in place that was headed up by a mayor around  the first city hall was erected in the market place and the kilianskirche built on the foundation of the michaelsbasilica was expanded the neckar privilege gave the city the right to modify the flow of the river in  which meant it now had the right to construct dams harbors and mills because of the infrastructure thus created during the th century heilbronn grew attractive to merchants and craftspeople who now demanded the right to determine their own fate in  charles iv holy roman emperor issued a new charter to the city now heilbronn needed to answer only to the emperor and as such was an imperial free city craftspeople and merchants were now represented in its council and the villages of böckingen flein frankenbach and neckargartach became part of heilbronns territory as an imperial free city heilbronn was threatened by the ambitious house of württemberg a relationship with the holy roman emperor and a treaty with the electorate of the palatinate in effect from  to  strengthened heilbronns position and kept the house of württemberg at bay the political

carmel was attacked and ransacked the city opened its gates in response to demands of the peasants and consequently more churches and municipal institutions were robbed the next day for about a month heilbronn remained under the control of revolting peasants and even though johann lachmann later a church reformer had attempted to mediate the peasants did not leave the city until one of their armies was defeated on may   in böblingen their leader rohrbach was executed on may   in neckargartach and his home town of böckingen was partially burnt to the ground in punishment in  the replacement of the mayor by hans riesser a protestant brought on the previously delayed reformation and through the efforts of reformer lachmann schools and healthcare were also reorganized in  the
