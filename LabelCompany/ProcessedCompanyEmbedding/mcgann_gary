of aon ireland his nonexecutive chairmanship of green reit and a clutch of academic qualifications but there was no mention of mcgann’s former nonexecutive directorship of anglo irish bank whose collapse imposed such a burden on the state mcgann was on its board until the last resigning along side other nonexecutive directors in the days after anglo’s nationalisation in  the following month he resigned his chairmanship of the stateowned dublin airport authority saying he had “acted with honesty and integrity” at all times in anglothe stock market notice from paddy power also made no
