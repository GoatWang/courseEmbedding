skillful donor mark v ewert the motley fool published  am sunday march   philanthropy is one of the toughest businesses there iswarren buffett on bloomberg news the oracle of omaha isnt the only person in his family who works with money alexander buffett rozek the grandson of buffetts sister doris has made great strides in the world of philanthropy rozek has been a leader in philanthropy education since  at the sunshine lady foundation which his grandmother founded in addition to managing an investment partnership in boston he served as director of the learning by giving program which began at sunshine lady before growing to become a separate foundation that now partners with more than  colleges and universities rozek is the foundations chairman and president with a team from google the learning by giving foundation has developed a massive open online course or mooc in philanthropy the first of its kind more than  people participated in it last year those participants collectively identified highperforming nonprofits  of which won cash grants from the foundation at the end of the course now the course has been retooled and is available on edx a nonprofit online learning site created by harvard and mit registration is open and free and you can participate in each section of the course on your own schedule if you want an easily accessible way to increase your skill and intelligence as a donor take this opportunity to register for giving with purpose if you have questions about online philanthropy education rozek may have an answer for you  i recently interviewed him and heres what he had to say     photo courtesy of alexander buffett rozek mark ewert what goals were you trying to meet by developing giving with purpose as a massive open online course alexander buffett rozek the goal was to take what has been pioneered in brickandmortar college and university classrooms over the last decade and expand it to an online classroom we are passionate that this can be a useful mechanism to get large amounts of philanthropic capital into communities where it can be the most effective its hard to distribute money thoughtfully this course and the mooc platform give participants the tools to do just that mark did the response to the first round of the online course last summer take you and the developers by surprise if so what was surprising alexander yes in good ways and in bad the demand exceeded our expectations and so did the passion of the students the good news is people care and that passion translates into the thoughtful grants as a result of this course  grants went out and that was due to the collective effort of thousands of students its inspiring to watch what can happen with a collective effort mark a good part of giving with purpose is dedicated to a framework called rise relevance impact sustainability excellence in management and operations for understanding and evaluating nonprofits each course participant is invited to apply the same rise framework to herself or himself as a philanthropist what role do a persons own motivations values faith or family culture have in being skillful with philanthropy alexander in my opinion personal motivations values culture etc are the raw materials learning how to apply them allows them to achieve the maximum effect a good example is a baseball player with a ton of raw talent with a great coach they can become an allstar mark the giving with purpose course encourages analysis of nonprofits based on their sustainability and results this would favor organizations that deliver consistent predictable outcomes yet your uncle howard g buffett emphasizes risktaking as essential to good philanthropy in his book  chances how can donors navigate this tension between conservative and highrisk investments in social change and make good choices about their charitable giving alexander i think the variable is learning and education the more we all learn from the challenges risks and achievements of others the more we will be able to achieve ourselves that is true in any endeavor the wright brothers took great risks and were followed by generations of aviators and engineers now aeronautics is a science we needed both over the past hundred years to get from there to where we are now mark toward the end of the course either in the classroom or on online the participants use money from the learning by giving foundation to make substantial grants to nonprofit organizations chosen by the course participants how can participants expect that to be different from when they are making donations from their own financial resources alexander if the course is successful it will not be any different hopefully they will take the lessons learned and apply them to their own donations and philanthropy staying with the aviation theme if you took a course on building a plane and your final project was a success in the air we hope that what you build on your own would fly as far or further than what you built in class mark the new and updated giving with purpose mooc has its registration open and will be starting soon what changes have you made this time using what you learned in the first round and what new materials have you included alexander the biggest change is that it is now on edx the edx version has the benefit of a user interface and user experience refined over a much larger audience and a much broader set of subjects so we feel the students will have an experience far improved over our first offering in addition the lesson material has been reshot we have a new guest speaker and the brandnew grant app allows for a better level of peer review and grantmaking experience than we have ever seen mark the motley fool community is made up of intelligent independent investors what would you say to these people as they consider stepping more intentionally into philanthropy alexander whether investing in securities or investing in humanity the goal should be to do so intelligently and any intelligent process is the outcome of careful study if you are interested in making a difference in your community

lessons learned and apply them to their own donations and philanthropy staying with the aviation theme if you took a course on building a plane and your final project was a success in the air we hope
