corelogics first quarter  earnings call ill begin today with a recap of our first quarter operating performance including update on market conditions growth trends and capital return jim will cover our first quarter financial results cost management programs and our second quarter outlook well conclude a qa before i begin my prepared remarks i want to acknowledge the passing of anand nallathambi on march  anand was an outstanding leader and a close friend and i want to sincerely thank the many individuals and organizations that extended their condolences and best wishes to the corelogic team and importantly to the nallathambi family anand and i worked very closely together over the past  years to execute against the shared vision of creating an innovative datadriven enterprise that delivers unique propertylevel insights to the global housing ecosystem anand was passionate about corelogic and i know he would have been very proud of the companys strong start in  and our continued execution against our medium and longer term strategic imperatives corelogic delivered a strong operating performance in the first quarter of  we remain very focused on building market leadership in our property intelligence underwriting and risk management solutions sets expanding operating leverage and margins through process and workflow optimization enhancing our technology infrastructure and expanding our innovation center and returning capital to our owners our q financial performance was in line with our expectations and with the outlook jim provided on our last earnings call during the quarter we substantially offset the impact of a  decline in us mortgage applications through a combination of market share gains pricing and the launch of new and enhanced products these positive factors should provide us with solid momentum and help to somewhat offset the forecasted slowdown in us refinancing volumes this year we generated underlying organic growth for the fifth consecutive quarter despite mortgage market headwinds lower projected  projectrelated revenues and planned vendor diversification by a significant appraisal management client in q underlying organic growth aggregated  over the past several years we have continued to build scale leveraged our core data assets and insights and diversified our revenues beyond our traditional stronghold in us mortgage underwriting today our nonus mortgage operations represent about  of our nonvsg revenues versus   years ago collectively they grew at a strong pace in q as we expand these businesses were also executing on our strategic initiative to build a scaled leadership position in property valuation solutions in the us we believe ultimately this is a multivertical and global opportunity corelogic is already the leading provider of valuation solutions in australia and new zealand in  we integrated landsafe rels and fnc into corelogic and built out our valuation solutions management team over the course of this year we will be focusing on building our operational capabilities and platformbased solutions offerings as well as diversifying appraisalrelated revenues with regard to revenue diversification in the first  months of this year we signed up several new clients for appraisal management services and expect to book revenues related to these wins beginning late in the second quarter diversification will continue to be a major focus for our appraisal management services team throughout  the us residential property valuation market is poised for transformation we believe that our scale as well as our technology data and analytics will prove to be advantages in the race to transform the way real estate assets are valued as we said in the past the opportunity to transform the valuation space and bring greater transparency to the underwriting process will be a multiyear endeavor and represents a significant long term opportunity for us during the first quarter we continue to make important investments enhancing and scaling our solution sets as well as expanding our innovation technology and compliance capabilities this strategy allows us to outperform us mortgage volume trends over the short medium and longer terms and to sustain our competitive advantage our focus on scaled and unique datadriven solutions makes us a logical strategic partner for any firm looking for a deep insight into the global real estate ecosystem as the pace of technology advancements has accelerated corelogic has invested to capture the opportunities and benefits of emerging tools and capabilities we launched our first innovation center a little over  years ago in the first quarter of this year we expanded our innovation platform with the opening of a new center in dallas the dallas center is slated to be our global innovation headquarters we also opened satellite innovation labs in sydney australia and oxford mississippi our positive organic growth trend over the past  quarters is underpinned to a significant degree by our continued focus on share gains pricing and product development innovation i believe our track record in making smart investments support durable growth and ultimately ensures our market leadership were able to reinvest because of our aggressive focus on driving scale operating leverage and efficiency regarding cost management and margins over the past several years we have made important strides in our pursuit of first quartile levels of operational excellence every member of the corelogic team is focused on quality and service improvements process and operational efficiency and cost productivity jim will provide more color on this a bit later our relentless focus on building scaled and unique solutions and driving for bestinclass operational effectiveness has resulted in the creation of a durable and highly cashgenerative business model corelogic remains committed to consistently returning significant levels of capital over the last  years we returned over  billion to our owners through our ongoing share repurchase program in  we repurchased  million shares in  we plan to repurchase another  million shares or about  of our outstanding share count through the first  months of this year we have repurchased  million shares although our share count  our share price has increased significantly in the past several years we believe that our current share price does not fully reflect the intrinsic value of our business and its future potential therefore in our view the ongoing repurchase of substantial numbers of our shares remains a significant source of long term value creation my final prepared remarks today will discuss market trends our view of the mortgage market volumes remains unchanged from our last earnings call the us mortgage market is progressively transitioning from its dependency on high levels of refinancing to a purchasedriven cycle we believe this transition will largely be completed during  we expect purchase volumes in  to increase from  levels fueled by growth in the economy population and firsttime homebuyers millennials are also becoming an increasing source of new housing demand and will be so for the foreseeable future we believe a return to the  of the us mortgage market to a purchasedriven foundation is good news in many ways for corelogic and the industry as a whole the end of the refinancing boom in the last  years although challenging in  sets the stage for a more predictable and sustainable growth pattern in us mortgage volumes in the years ahead this bodes well for our future as we have a longestablished track record of consistently outperforming mortgage market trends through a focus on driving market leadership and scale in our core operations as well as smart acquisitions i believe that the success in transforming corelogic as a highperforming global leader is a direct result of our continued successful execution against our strategic imperatives which are focused on delivering unique property insights these insights allow participants in the housing ecosystem to make better decisions in the areas of prospect identification underwriting and continuous risk management and monitoring in closing corelogic is off to a solid start in  we remain laserfocused on market leadership and accelerating our growth rates as well as expanding margin and cash flow i want to thank our employees our clients and our shareholders for their continued support jim will now discuss our financial results james balas thanks frank and good morning everyone today im going to discuss our first quarter financial results cost management programs and second quarter outlook as frank mentioned corelogic is off to a strong start in  both from an operational and a financial perspective for the first  months of the year we outperformed us mortgage application volume trends drove productivity and costreduction initiatives generated high levels of cash flow and returned significant capital to our shareholders notable first quarter  financial highlights included first continued organic growth trends supported by share gains pricing and new products second significant progress towards achieving our costreduction targets third generation of substantial free cash flow and finally the repurchase of  million of our common shares first quarter revenues totaled  million compared with  million in the same  period during the quarter market share and pricingrelated gains as well as contributions from new products in both the property intelligence and the risk management and work flow segments helped to offset the impact of an estimated  decline in us mortgage applications lower demand for projectrelated advisory services and the winddown of noncore product lines pi revenues declined  to  million in the first quarter driven by lower valuation solutions revenues due to lower mortgage application volumes and planned vendor diversification by a significant appraisal management client additionally pi revenues were also impacted by lower demand for projectrelated advisory services pi revenues attributable to insurance spatial solutions and international were higher in the first quarter rmw revenues totaled  million consistent with  levels as the benefits from organic growth offset the unfavorable impacts from lower mortgage volumes and the winddown of noncore product lines operating income from continuing operations totaled  million for the first quarter compared with  million in the prior year the decline in operating income was principally attributable to lower mortgage application volumes as well as charges associated with costreduction programs including severance and real estate consolidation cost and investments in technology innovation and compliance programs first quarter operating income also included a onetime acceleration of stockbased compensation first quarter net income from continuing operations totaled  million compared with  million in  the decline was primarily the result of lower levels of income from operating activities discussed previously partially offset by lower interest costs and tax provisions diluted eps from continuing operations totaled  for the first quarter of  compared with  in  adjusted eps totaled  down  yearoveryear reflecting lower first quarter operating income levels partially offset by the benefit of lower interest costs and tax provisions and the impact of share repurchases adjusted ebitda totaled  million in the first quarter compared with  million in the same prior year period the  yearoveryear decline in adjusted ebitda was principally the result of lower mortgage application volumes higher technology innovation and compliance costs and charges associated with costreduction programs pi segment adjusted ebitda totaled  million compared to  million in  the reduction in pi adjusted ebitda was attributable to the impact of lower mortgage application volumes planned vendor diversification by a significant appraisal management client and the impact of lower demand for projectrelated advisory services rmw adjusted ebitda was  million down  million from  levels as continued organic growth and productivity benefits partially offset the impacts of lower mortgage application volumes and higher spending on compliance and cost management programs finally we continue to generate very strong levels of free cash flows in the first quarter on a trailing  months basis as of march   free cash flow totaled  million or  of adjusted ebitda i will close my prepared remarks today with a discussion on our cost management programs and our second quarter financial outlook as we previously announced we expect to reduce run rate cost by  million in  by consolidating facilities reducing staffing levels outsourcing certain activities and other operational improvements during the first quarter of this year we moved aggressively to secure these cost reductions by reducing our global staffing levels by  and consolidating various offices andor operations although the cost of taking these actions reduced our q profitability somewhat the achievement of our full year savings target should boost adjusted ebitda margins by about  basis points corelogic is committed to achieving plus adjusted ebitda margin over the next  years based on a normalized us mortgage market and after accounting for the buildout of our valuation solutions platform we expect to achieve our margin goals through a combination of profitable growth favorable revenue mix as well as business model transformation and cost productivity in terms of the second quarter of  based on normal seasonality patterns and our current view of market volumes and cost trends within our business as well as investment timing we expect that adjusted q ebitda will be  to  higher than first quarter  levels our full year  financial guidance remains unchanged our longstated capital allocation strategy remains in place we will continue to reinvest in product and service development productivity and cost management programs in addition we will opportunistically pursue strategic acquisitions in the repurchase of our common shares as well as retirement of outstanding debt to sum it up corelogic is off to a strong start in  and we believe were well positioned to continue to deliver strong financial results over the balance of this year thanks for your time today i will now turn the call back over to the operator for qa questionandanswer session operator operator instructions the first question comes from bill warmington with wells fargo william warmington frank back when you first joined corelogic in august  you and anand may he rest in peace implemented an operational efficiency and costreduction program that basically lowered corelogics breakeven point from around  trillion in mortgage originations to about  trillion and that level was tested and proved out when the mortgage market troughed back in the first half of  but since then youve made a number of changes to the business with acquisitions divestitures and additional cost cuts and so my question is how do you think about your mortgage market breakeven point today and going forward frank martell yes thanks bill so i think a couple of factors are relevant to answer that question first of all as i talked about the revenue diversification of the company we had been working on a prevsg taking the mortgage concentration down i think weve been pretty successful there as i mentioned we went from kind of  to about  of concentration mortgage and that  i think that trend will continue were  we do believe that valuation solutions represent a very unique opportunity for the company and i think from that perspective its well worth the investment its not only  not only is it a mortgage opportunity but its also a multivertical and a global opportunity so we see that as unique its a very fragmented space so in the near term thats  i wouldnt put in the context of a breakeven scenario but its certainly in terms of us trying to get to as jim said the  margin threshold for the total company that requires a bit more time but were  we used to talk about in a  trillion market making at least  margin for the mortgagerelated businesses i think clearly weve exceeded that threshold i dont know the exact number but probably several hundred basis points if i had to guesstimate on the call and so i think weve improved on that scenario that you talked about i dont think we ever talked about it in terms of breakeven but in terms of holding a reasonable  margin and in a trough market weve done that i think the mix of the company is materially better than it was  years ago well much more concentrated in terms of our solution set and where we play than we used to be so were a fewer bigger businesses with much more operating leverage so i think our profitability characteristics are clearly superior right now as we talked about the real challenge is really absorbing vsg and getting that to a highermargin threshold right now were in the low teen and we need to get that up and i fully expect to get  be able to get that up through really a combination of mix price recovery cost management and a diversification of the amc revenue william warmington and then for my brief followup how are you feeling about  guidance given the new wins at vsg and also the strong free cash flow performance thats well ahead of the  ebitda conversion that youve been guiding to frank martell yes i think first of all the first quarter was exactly what we expected it we had to make some investments we had to get the cost actions the sooner you can get those done the better off you are from an impact perspective so we went hard at the cost elements of that obviously you have things like severance involved there as jim mentioned were really aggressively continuing to compress our real estate footprint we think that has many benefits beyond frankly the cost elements so i think that was a good result so the first quarter in terms of taking the actions we need i thought was exactly as we expected we continue to invest in innovation which was a point i stressed in my prepared remarks but also we invested a fair amount in compliance as we had the last couple of years because as you know the doddfrank rules and the cfpb and everything else has ratcheted up the performance in that area and it makes us a stronger partner for our clients so weve invested in those areas as well and i think those will bear fruit on the top line and the margin line as we go forward so i think first quarter was a very solid kind of onthescript type of a quarter jim provided second quarter numbers on ebitda i think obviously were going to see a  to  acceleration on the level of ebitda for the first quarter some of that is seasonal we usually get a   seasonal bump so thats obviously an acceleration beyond the normal seasonal characteristics some of that is less cost on some of these investments and some of it is the efficiency benefit of the cost actions so i feel good about second quarter it validates the full year range that we have out there right now and yes well revisit that in the midyear i would say the other thing is a real home run for us obviously was cash flow in the first quarter and we bought back more shares that we traditionally do in the first quarter because its such a short window but we will continue to repurchase shares on an aggressive level as we go through this year and i think the cash flow is a real win there and again i think as we look at the guidance well probably look at that conversion target that we normally use to  and update that in midyear as well operator the next question comes from darrin peller with barclays darrin peller look i think weve characterized the results more as an outside strength in the rmw side of the business just based on what we would have expected on originations to impact that so clearly market share gains there were coming in strong with  on the other side of that the vsg side being a bit of a slower start maybe attributable to certain clients but i guess if you  give us a sense  it would be helpful to give us more of a sense of this sustainability to that i mean in terms of the originationsensitive businesses outside of vsg first market share gains there were  is that going to continue i mean is that an opportunity for you guys to continue to really outperform the origination trends in that area through the year maybe a little more color on what you see happening there and then on the vsg side i mean i know its  you indicated it came in in line with what youd expected but again theres a couple of clients or a client that i think has been maybe a little more either challenged or moving share around so just curious to know what types of scale were talking about in terms of new clients that can roll on to vsg in the second half and what kind of run rate we could expect frank martell sure darrin yes so just on  to parse that out i do think the first quarter was as expected and as we kind of talked about on the last call so i dont  there wasnt really any new news in the first quarter i think we executed really almost exactly as we planned to do and as we thought wed do i would say that weve tried to be aggressive on the cost actions i mentioned it earlier in bills  in response to bills question so i think first quarter theres no surprise there theres no really anything kind of different in terms of the question on nonvsg origination rmw had a good performance in the first quarter as it really has for the last  or  years i think the team there has done a terrific job really focusing on quality service levels and also product innovation which i think has been why theyve been able to take share weve done a great job the last couple of years in credit as well as tax and flood in particular those  businesses that credit has come on strong now some of thats trend  things like trended data and a few other things like that flowing through for the full year but clearly our  kind of powerhouse origination businesses have performed well and i think thats really a tribute to the team and the underlying product quality and delivery i think theres additional realm room for share per share gains particularly credit we have some new product in tax and flood that i think will continue to grow those businesses so i think those businesses are in good shape and i think theyll continue the same trend we saw in the first quarter so i have no concern there and im optimistic there as it relates to vsg as weve talked about theres really  components of the revenue stream in vsg theres the appraisal management end of the business which is really as you guys may remember there was  clients that was really rels and landsafe those  were captives so we had a noncompete so we really were not able to diversify revenue in  we started working on it in the first quarter and i think we have a solid number of new clients signed up it just takes a while to see the revenue so i think well see  in the back half of the second quarter well see some revenue flow there is it going to be an exact replacement in the short run for some of this diversification from the one client i think itll fill up that bucket to a certain degree but not fully in the short run but thats factored into the guidance so i think thats not a surprise i think ultimately we will end up with a diversified mix there but  and a scale thats unique in the industry on the appraisal side obviously the game for us is not to do it the same way its always been done but to really automate digitize and make it a really different customer expense so ultimately the margins that traditionally are in that business which are kind of the midteens to upper teens i think could grow into the mids through automation digitization et cetera and thats what were working hard on the other part of the business which we havent focused as much on but ultimately is extremely important in the strategy is the platform side of this equation fnc is a great platform used by over  lenders connects the over  well over  appraisers and a myriad of other constituencies like home inspectors so thats a huge platform for us to reach out and monetize more of our services so thats an area that we will be talking more about as we go forward and one thats a tremendous opportunity and at a much much higherlevel margin so if you look at the last couple of calls we talked about margins that are for vsg in the aggregate that ultimately will look something like the  target that we have and that will come through the mix in the expansion of that area which we have a big focus on so i think vsg is again no new news there but im giving you a little more granularity because i want to make sure that people know that those are the key areas of focus those  areas and i think diversification on the amc side the expansion of the platform side and then i havent gotten into the third area which ultimately i think is an extra benefit is the monetization of the data resident on those platform businesses we have over  million appraisals for example in our national database that came with fnc that is a rich source of additional data so lots of opportunity on the vsg side early innings we talked about it its a multiyear because its a pretty stayed area of the market but one thats critical for our clients and critical for our business partnership darrin peller all right so i mean just to characterize it sounds like youre saying that rmw is going to be able to grow outpace the mortgage market the way you did this quarter i guess in the next couple of quarters is that right and then the vsg side we should expect some revenue to fill in what was sort of lost loss from the diversification but not to the same full degree frank martell yes so i would say that thats correct darrin and i think thats all embedded in our guidance for the year and look i think again just to kind of give the rmw guys a pat on the back i mean theyve really earned their market positions through quality and service and i think were clearly the market leader in the  businesses and were innovating and growing and i think thats going to continue darrin peller okay thats helpful just a very quick followup just to be clear at least the margin side i know they were the onetime items you mentioned i mean those were some of the severance costs et cetera that impacted the quarters margins especially on the rmw side that  your guidance is still for margin expansion for the year suggesting obviously that those really are more onetime in nature i guess and youre going to have  not see a lot of that repeat i just want to make that  make sure thats clear james balas yes darrin the severance clearly we dont expect that going forward the other components  well still have a little bit of compliance on the first half of the year itll probably normalize in the back half operator the next question comes from chas tyson with kbw chas tyson i just want to follow up on the last point you made particularly on kind of increasing the margin in the vsg you noted thats a combination of mix price recovery and cost management can you just rank order those and talk about which ones contribute the most and then on fnc can you talk about how you expand that platform is it essentially increasing the number of offerings that are on there away from just appraisal to more offerings and kind of making it a more holistic mortgage gateway frank martell yes so chas this is frank so i think on fnc its been  the revenue has been traditionally around the order entry and fulfillment aspect of that platform so i mentioned data but theres a lot of other were looking at how to add more of a corelogic existing data sets on to that order entry fulfillment so theres a distributional play there theres a data play an analytics play so theres a number of different factors that we think we can take existing assets and mix them in on that platform and get a benefit from that so i think theres that also the  just the organic growth that that company has grown and continues to grow organically through new client acquisitions so i think fnc is a  has a pretty durable business revenue model and also frankly has a i think some upside opportunity there all of that should be at strong margin levels so as that business grows it becomes a more important part of the mix of the vsg thats going to lift our margins i think on the amc side or the appraisal management side it is definitely if i rank order in the near term its about panel integration and getting diversification those are really id say the key elements to this year but also as you look at the next year fundamentally the optimization the workflow it takes  to  days on average to do an appraisal these days thats too long for the industry to  from a clientexperience perspective so were trying to looking to shortening that substantially if you can shorten it then the economics and the margin characteristics change dramatically thats just a manufacturingtype truism if you can do something twice as fast youre going to be able to have a lot of leverage there so thats what were working on there ultimately and so thats i would say an important but maybe perhaps medium to longer term chas tyson okay and then on the major client thats diversifying i guess just based on some rough math but quickly maybe  of the revenues came off is that the right way to think about it is there  i mean how much more do we have to go in terms of them diversifying throughout this year or maybe next frank martell yes well obviously thats  to their discretion theres no lender can guarantee you volumes under the regulations so from that perspective we have  id just emphasize we have a very strong leadership position with both of these clients so were not talking about something dramatic there but they  when we acquired that asset they had a stated diversification plan we knew that its in the numbers so its not a surprise to us and so the key to me is not their diversification because we kind of know what that is its more how quickly we can fill the bucket and ultimately frankly to have a much more stable revenues in reo because obviously the diversification  youre not hitching your start to just  or  players but having said that those  players have and will provide a tremendous foundation for market leadership for corelogic and so we want to make sure that we keep as much share as possible so were not relinquishing share beyond what we have to to accommodate their planning were definitely fighting hard for every dollar of revenue in both of our major clients but also as we get the diversification going operator the next question comes from kevin mcveigh with deutsche bank palmer miles this is palmer on for kevin can you give a little bit more color on the revenue split between rmw and pi as it relates to the guidance and you guys have touched on it before but how should we think about that revenue mix moving forward frank martell yes for the first quarter revenues roughly  for the quarter and thats kind of where we were last year ex vsg obviously and so this quarter i think  i dont see thats going to shift dramatically the ex vsg potentially but the revenue of the company remains kind of that ish and i think in terms of growth levels we expect  in the guidance we expect them to both outperform the mortgage market obviously rmw is significantly exposed to us mortgage volumes and the pi segment less so so that provides us a little bit of a different growth characteristics depending on how the market behaves operator the next question comes from jason deleeuw with piper jaffray jason deleeuw so i was just hoping to get a sense for the pricing benefits to revenue and can we expect those to continue to kind of or just to flow through for the remainder of the year and then any color on kind of new products also kind of contributing to the revenue growth outlook james balas so if you think about it the organic growth rate was about  the  big levers in that were essentially the pricing and the new product growth they were pretty equal in contributing to that amount if you think back the last year we have a  growth rate exiting the fourth quarter half of that was roughly market and the balance was coming from share gains pricing and new product growth so this was very much in line with what we expected and yes we do expect that to continue throughout the year jason deleeuw and then frank im just kind of  would like to get your thoughts on ma i mean the business is cash flowing great and im just wondering if strategically are all the pieces in place or are there other avenues youre looking at or fulltime stuff just would like to get your highlevel thoughts frank martell yes so id say theres nothing new on ma we  there is a tremendous amount of assets out there in play i think i dont know if thats a function of where the market cycle is but we remain pretty disciplined the vsg deals we did in really  were the last ones weve done we didnt do  we just closed fnc in  early  but we do remain focused on our ma stream which is scaling capabilities datafocused and i think that screen has served us well the last six years were focused on that i think there are a lot of assets out there but i want to be disciplined in where they  if we do any transactions where that is and how that integrates into the company were obviously interested in scaling our vsgrelated areas in the right areas as an example continue to look at our spatial business for example and its been a tremendous growth there for us in high valueadded areas so those types of areas remain of interest to us and then just general scaling so i think they would all have to be largely accretive but we remain pretty disciplined on that front operator the next question comes from andrew jeffrey with suntrust andrew jeffrey along the lines of insurance and spatial frank im wondering if we could get a little bit of color in terms of how that business is growing how much of the growth is from share and price and new products and what the competitive environment is generally i know you dont break it out formally in your reporting but would love to get a little color on how much thats contributing to the growth and how much it might going forward frank martell sure so the iss business the insurance and spatial business is growing kind of midsingle digits the first quarter of the year so  and again theres not a  theres not the same seasonality characteristics in insurance as there is in a little bit more in spatial frankly so a solid start to the year that growth rate is a little bit higher than historically theyve grown in the last   years id say theres a pretty good balance between price and product weve actually had a lot more product introductions the last  years which are starting to yield some good benefit not a significant share component to that so its more pricing and product introduction thats driving that growth and we feel pretty good about that starting to see some leverage with the corelogic data assets and that was one of the premises when we built up the insurance verticals theres a lot of cross polarization of data assets both from insurance into the core business and from the core business to insurance so thats working pretty well so that business  and again very very good margin very good cash flow business and a great data and synergy play for us and its been terrific andrew jeffrey and then how do you think about organic revenue growth sort of through the cycle for your business recognizing that as you said the mortgage market is changing now do you think that  youre putting up  in a pretty tough macro environment what should we think about if  for example is a flatvolume kind of year frank martell yes actually i think the good thing is i was pretty pleased with the organic growth because we dont  implicit in the volume situation is a lot of lenders and the services are still under siege in their own operations a lot of regulatory pressure you guys see the headlines and some of the different things that are going on out there so a lot of lenders are not rushing to spend a lot of money in fact theyre cutting back in a lot of areas so its an interesting time period i think weve been able to grow organically through share gains but i think importantly pricing is a bigger component and product and thats going to have a benefit as we come out of this cycle thats going to be more pronounced than it is right now if you look at pricing i think we feel pretty good were going to get to that we talked about it a couple of years ago but were going to get to that  percentage type annual impact as we roll through  and the mortgage market finally gets back to kind of a purchasedriven market because its been a real roller coaster the last  years in terms of refis and its been great and not great great so with that flattening out i think youre going to see a more pronounced benefit on pricing we just  we said it before but weve got  i think the best product pipeline weve had in indiscernible with the company and thats been hard fought but its  and the good news its not just one product its a lot of different areas and it leverages off the course so i think those  areas in particular are going to be beneficial to us i think we have share gains that are still to go there are a lot of very interesting areas in the property space but we have to make some investments what you saw the first quarter around technology platforms and all that kind of stuff can deliver those and deploy those in a digital age and so i think  i feel good about the hopeful acceleration of our organic growth trends beyond the last couple of years which have been okay but i think i look forward to acceleration operator the next question comes from jeff meuler with baird nick nikitas this is nick nikitas on for jeff can you walk through your sensitivity or exposure to mortgage apps versus origination volumes in any given quarter so i know you mentioned that apps were down i think it was  in q the origination forecast i think was expecting volumes up slightly so im just wondering how we should think about that exposure going forward and the quarterly impact james balas yes nick this is jim the way to think about it is first of all the first quarter was a bit disconnected between the closed loans and the applications and that was essentially due to transition in the market going to higher volumes to lower and then in terms of our sensitivity apps ex the tax services which is really at the closed loan stage the majority of our products are really at the application  have the application exposure because of their early upfront in the origination process nick nikitas okay thats helpful and then just going back to the organic growth i just want to confirm so the  for this quarter is kind of ex end market or mortgage market volumes james balas correct nick nikitas and then so if we look back to kind of the past couple of quarters the right way to think about it is kind of this ish plus a little bit rate going back to the second half of  with a mix  kind of new products and pricing james balas correct as we discussed on the last call we had  and about half of that was market and now that were in the dire market were quoting about a  number which is pretty consistent with what we exited the back half of  operator the next question comes from glenn greene with oppenheimer glenn greene sorry i have to belabor i just want to go back to the organic growth just on  i want to understand your definition of it because you still have another quarter of fnc thats sort of rolled in and probably at a  basis points or something and fx was probably added to it as well so i just want to understand so weve got a baseline how to think about it going forward what are you including or excluding from underlying organic growth james balas its market the product winddowns that weve done in the past and it definitely excludes acquisitions we dont include acquisitions growth in the organic growth value and we also strip out fx fx was pretty modest this past quarter glenn greene and how much was the noncore product winddown roughly how much of  what kind of impact to revenue was that frank martell yes really glenn its become pretty de minimis now its i think a  million or  million with the amount total amount we were really at the tail end of that winddown glenn greene and does fnc have any meaningful volume sensitivity or i didnt think it did but  so i was thinking that was more like   line of quarter frank martell theres a little bit of volume sensitivity in fnc but its  as you know its a platform company so theres other aspects to it that are not volumerelated glenn greene okay and then the one number that really stood out to me and i think darrin might have touched it this but the credit and screening business which you would think would be the most sensitive to mortgage apps and you called out the negative  mortgage apps but that line grew  was there meaningful pricing in there is there trended data in there i cant frank martell yes theres trended data which is obviously running through that line just remember the mortgage piece of that business is less than  its kind of a little bit below  that business has other components to it that are nonmortgage trimerge mortgage support so youve got auto and you got a few other things in there as well so the trends wont be a match for the mortgage market trends necessarily clearly glenn there  the team has done  i mean thats been indiscernible so weve picked up some good share over the last couple of years and that in addition to trended data are really whats fueling that line glenn greene okay and then the diversification of the one of the large clients in vsg i know you expected the diversification but is it  is the magnitude of the diversification happening like you thought and  or was it sort of that a full  do you think of full run rate or is there more to come frank martell no i think its a little more episodic than we thought it would be and actually we probably are in better shape a little bit in better shape than we thought we would be because when we did the deal there was a plan that was presented but that plan obviously will change but weve never really  we dont consult on that obviously thats their plan and not our plan so  but we have a pretty good dialogue going and i think were definitely holding our own theres not a real surprise i think the biggest challenge is more timing frankly than anything else because we provide guidance based on certain assumptions and then we cant control that but its been pretty  id say its been within the realms glenn greene okay and then just sort of a nuance question but your  ebitda margin target you talked about with year time frame sort of parse this but are you thinking end of  end of  i just wasnt clear on that james balas yes i think kind of ish is what we were  what were kind of thinking about but operator the next question comes from john campbell with stephens john campbell just want to touch back on the costreduction target and then the spin required to get you there i mean it sounds like maybe a lot of the full year investment spend was kind of pulled forward into q that drove margin compression but obviously you guys are expecting a solid q ebitda can you kind of just  i dont know jim if you can do this can help us size up what that spin was in q what remains for the  or whats remaining on the balance of the year just basically trying to get to a i guess net cost saves of that  million you guys called out for the year james balas yes so on the savings  on the cost and the actions the majority of that is on the first quarter we will experience additional spend throughout the year but clearly the biggest component was in the first quarter related to severance and things like facilities and so forth and thats included in kind of those unusual spikes in costs that we had within the  million to  million and the way the phase will roll out during the course of the year is well see that start to hit in the second quarter a good slug of it will be in the second quarter and itll probably top up in the third and fourth quarters john campbell okay and then back to vsg nice job on the wins there i know you guys called that out last quarter maybe that you were expecting that but is there something that you had factored in or implied in annual guidance when you guys indiscernible put that out or is that upside to original guidance frank martell yes we clearly had a diversification factored into the guide i think first quarter was pretty much in line with where we thought   clients so that was kind of good and theyre the right clients for us so that worked out really well but its  that clearly we hadnt assumed john campbell okay and then i guess the new client wins it sounds like you guys have actually signed them and youre maybe just in the process of onboarding and you expect that in the back half but what was that  did you have those new client wins in original annual guidance frank martell yes theres a lag once you contract but  so we expect revenue  as i said in my remarks its kind of we expect revenue flow in the back half of q and then it should ramp over the remainder of the year in terms of the numbers of clients and the revenue contributions so i think thats pretty normal operator the next question comes from kevin kaczmarek with zelman  associates kevin kaczmarek just following up on the last question can you give us some color on who these clients are are they like top  lenders top  and how much of their appraisal work do you think you can eventually get over time frank martell yes i mean so there  i would say first of all theyre a mix of depository and nondepository originators theyre definitely the top  and top  frankly so theyre not small we would not be for example kevin  of their volume were a portion of their volume and so what were trying to do is make sure that as we add clients that as i said its kind of the right fit for us and what well try to do ultimately with the digitization and the customer experience there and so these clients definitely fit that mold but we would be a portion of these new clients volumes and i think its a good start as i said i think its within  certainly within my expectations kevin kaczmarek okay and are these fastergrowing lenders like some of the online guys that have been growing at above market pace or are they more kind of maintaining their share over the past few years frank martell no id say that theyre growth originators obviously lets put it in the context that the market is coming down but i think in the context of the market yes theyre a good growth kind of innovative lenders kevin kaczmarek okay i think just one last thing within the servicing business overall theres been a lot of movements citi is getting out of direct servicing and theres some privatelabel services that are changing around does this affect you guys in terms of tax processing should we see any lumpy additions or subtractions in the next couple of years as all these changes kind of take place frank martell no as you guys know we did have a small jv with citi thats been wound down and  but theres nothing material operator the next question comes from josh lamers with william blair joshua lamers since were over the hour mark here ill just ask  quick broaderbased questions first looking at vsg out over the next couple of quarters couple of years is there anything to note in terms of pressure there whether its coming from lack of supply of appraisers increased compensation excessive regulation anything that we should read into that might impact these segments over the next couple of years frank martell josh look as i said this area is ripe for transformation honestly and to do that you need to scale and you need innovation and you need data and we have all of those assets so thats why were kind of in this so i think this industry will change i personally dont think its a lack of appraisers its more workflow and automation and applying technology which i think everybody wants to do so theres an alignment of interest i think across the constituencies so i think theres a lot of opportunity for growth in this area frankly and insight so i dont see the need for appraisals going away i dont see reshaping theres lots and lots of fragmentation obviously were trying to scale up a bit to leverage our existing scale and i dont see a dislocation per se theres clearly pressure points in the industry as you mentioned theres demographics of appraisers theres regulatory pressures theres lots of rules and regulations that are challenging and those are all under discussion but i think its going to  the outcome is going to be for a better customer experience and a more automated experience and i think we hope to be a leader there joshua lamers and then one last one given the expansion of the nonus operations just a quick comment on the australian housing market and any impact anything we might expect or could surprise us if the australian housing market does take a dive frank martell not really i mean every year they kind of project pressure but every year the housing market is pretty  its been pretty durable in australia you got kind of the capital cities which is where all the action is and were out of the gate strong in the first quarter so i dont see any major issue there operator this concludes our questionandanswer session and the conference is also now
