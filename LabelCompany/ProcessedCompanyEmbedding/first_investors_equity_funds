bonds and money market products the fund is managed by a professional asset management team mutual fund pricing and performance i am interested in equity funds mixed asset funds taxable bond funds tax exempt funds prospectuses  reports fund pricing  performance go why mutual funds foresters financial has long advocated investing in mutual funds as a key component in building a diversified investment portfolio mutual funds are comprised of a basket of securities such as equities bonds and money market instruments and thus offer the benefit of builtin diversification when you invest in a mutual fund you essentially pool your money with other investors who have similar goals and allow a professional asset management team to make the underlying investment decisions about dozens of securities most people cannot afford to buy on their own    please note diversification and asset allocation do not guarantee a profit nor do they eliminate the risk of loss of principal our philosophy taking the longterm view today too many individuals and investment firms concentrate solely on shortterm performance at foresters financial weve always stayed focused on the long term for more than  years—through several wars recessions and countless bull and bear market cycles—weve consistently provided guidance to help our clients reach their longterm financial goals   our conservative approach to investing means that regardless of what goal youre saving for—owning a home sending a child to college or funding your retirement—we encourage a longterm approach to investing this in fact is the timeframe our mutual fund portfolio managers have in mind when they choose investments for the funds they manage here are some of the other goals we follow in managing our funds   we respect risk at all times our appreciation for risk underlies all of the investment decisions we make we take fund performance very seriously while we strive to have as many of our funds as possible in the upper half of their respective peer groups we dont take on the risks that are necessary to be at the top of those groups were willing to miss the biggest gains in bull markets we dont think its prudent to take the risks that are necessary to achieve those gains   we seek lower volatility for our funds volatility is the enemy of longterm investors at foresters financial we  believe that using a longterm strategy is the best way to achieve your financial goals to help you stay on track to reach those goals we try to minimize volatility as much as we can what types of mutual funds are available foresters financial offers the first investors family of mutual funds which contains a wide variety of fund options to meet your shortterm and longterm investing needs you can use individual funds or a diversified portfolio of funds to meet your particular goals and objectives   our mutual funds are divided into two categories core and noncore core funds are a building block in the foundation of your complete investment program they generally carry a moderate level of risk and are well diversified examples of core funds include growth  income total return and investment grade  noncore funds carry a higher degree of risk but can be a good way to diversify a portfolio or to achieve a specific investment objective international and global are noncore funds that can give you access to growth opportunities outside the united states whether youre a novice or an experienced investor whether your goal is to provide a comfortable retirement fund a college education increase current income save for a new home or provide tax savings a foresters financial registered representative can help you decide on an appropriate mix of core and noncore funds for your investment portfolio equity taxable bond mixed asset tax exempt money market select tabs equity taxable bond mixed asset tax exempt money market equity or stock funds invest primarily in companies of varying sizes small caps midcaps large caps and can be domestic international or both on balance equity funds give you the highest potential rate of return as well as the highest level of risk first investors equity funds covered call strategy equity income global growth  income hedged us equity opportunities fund international long short fund opportunity real estate select growth and special

mix of stocks bonds and cash and are a suitable option if you want total return and diversification first investors mixed asset allocation funds total return and balanced income these funds mainly invest in securities issued by municipalities to finance public projects such as bridges schools and highways the primary benefit of investing in municipal bonds is their taxexempt status depending on
