products partners q  earnings conference call all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise after the speakers remarks there will be a questionandanswer session it is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to mr randy burkhalter please go ahead sir john randy burkhalter  enterprise products partners lp thank you nicole good morning everyone and welcome to our first quarter call our speakers today will be jim teague chief executive officer of enterprise and director of enterprise general partner and bryan bulawa chief financial officer other members of our senior management team are in attendance today for the call during this call we will make forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities and exchange act of  based on the beliefs of the company as well as assumptions made by and information readily available to enterprises management team although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forwardlooking statements are reasonable it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct please refer to our latest filings with the sec for a list of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forwardlooking statements made during this call and with that ill turn the call over to jim a james teague  enterprise products partners lp thank you randy our business continued to perform well in the first quarter benefiting from our integrated systems the momentum from an improved price environment but i think most of all from the relentless drive of our employees as demandoriented projects such as ethylene plants fire generation and lng exports begin to come online we believe the us is entering into a period of strong demand growth while many companies have been busy trying to weather the storm of the last two years weve positioned ourselves for the demand phase of the cycle and are set to benefit from the demand increases that are coming for us hydrocarbons it felt good to see the word record in our press release and with production coming back and a number of our own long lead time projects coming online we hope to be using that word more total gross operating margin was  billion up  from first quarter of last year ebitda was a record  billion and our distributable cash flow was up  with a coverage ratio of  three of our four business segments reported higher gross operating margins than the same quarter last year we had record ngl pipeline transportation volumes record marine terminal volumes and record onshore liquids pipeline transportation volumes of  million barrels a day our biggest demand project our pdh remains on target to be up and running in the third quarter permitting and engineering is moving along for our ibdh plant which is expected to be up in the second half of  both of these projects are similar as the movement towards increased ethane cracking that brought us numerous feedstock opportunities is now giving us the opportunity to take growing lpg volumes and turn them into higher value propylene and butylene in april we announced that well develop ethylene storage and transportation in and around our us gulf coast assets because we are already connected to every ethylene plant in the us and supply them with substantial amounts of their ethane and propane as well as their storage needs we feel like we can add value to these customers storing and transporting their ethylene we expect that to be online in  as to supply projects in the permian we recently announced a major ngl pipeline our chinook pipeline the pipeline will have an initial capacity of  barrels a day but its expandable to  barrels a day we expect that in service in the first half of  this pipe adds to our other westtoeast ngl pipelines in moving ngls to our fractionation storage distribution and export systems at mont belvieu we recently added two new processing plants in the permian and have a third our orla plant under construction and frankly we expect to add more processing in that basin as our forecast indicated that additional gas processing will be needed we have plant   under construction in order to support all of these liquids which is expected to be up and running in the first half of next year our midlandtosealy crude pipeline is currently under construction with an expected inservice date late this year ramping up to full capacity early next year there are two areas that have been seen as laggards over the last couple of years the eagle ford and the haynesville starting with the haynesville over the last  to  months there have been significant ma activity the buyers are applying new drilling and completion techniques have very low breakevens and are experiencing significantly improved initial production rates and reserves and they are committed to the basin and are moving quickly to maximize their returns after bottoming at  rigs last year haynesville rig counts have improved considerably to around  and there were over  wells drilled in the play in the first quarter with parties like covey park considering ipo it appears that capital markets understand the capabilities of these new producers and the capabilities of the haynesville with this increased level of activity volumes in our gathering systems are increasing rapidly in fact by yearend we project that our state line system in north louisiana could exceed our peak volumes of a half of  bcf set back in  this outlook was a key driver behind our recent acquisition of the azure gathering and processing assets these assets access both rich and lean haynesville and cotton valley production and are an excellent fit with our systems in east texas and louisiana in addition these assets complement our supply footprint and will help us grow our gulf coast markets we feel good about what we have seen from this new type of haynesville producer and we like where the production sits relative to growing demand in the eagle ford similar to what we have seen in the haynesville eagle ford acreage is now beginning to turn over in a trend that is expected to continue the highest profile resale was anadarkos sale to sanchez but there have been others including pioneer selling some of their atascosa county acreage and acreage sales by newfield sm and rosetta obviously the cost of entry is much lower in the eagle ford than the permian and the basin has technical upside both in new drilling and completion techniques and in the spec phase now being developed in the upper eagle ford austin chalk and the buda after hitting the low of  rigs last october the eagle ford rig count has moved up to around  with  wells permitted and  horizontal wells drilled during the first quarter while rig count increases – instantaneously bring incremental volumes we project that eagle ford production is now stabilizing and will soon begin to grow as eagle ford production grows we have the capacity in our existing assets so increased production means cash flow upside and from a competitive standpoint our enterprise value chain is hard to match we also believe there isnt a better basin situated for the growth in the crude ngl and gas markets including exports finally we think its important that the market appreciates the ability of the houston ship channel to handle the growth in energy exports that we expect to occur over the next  to  years with our facilities at our enterprise hydrocarbons terminal and at morgans point there isnt a company that has more experience and more conviction around the capabilities of the houston ship channel than enterprise over the years weve become used to rhetoric from competitors trying to get a toehold into exports but recently the houston ship channel has been the recipient of deceptive allegations from folks promoting other texas ports frankly because they dont have and cant get a position on the ship channel ive read commentary from socalled experts many of whom have never loaded a ship about growing congestion on the houston ship channel people are entitled to their own opinions they are not entitled to their own facts here are the facts actual ship traffic data shows that the houston ship channel operates at well under  of its peak day capacity nothing compares to the ship channels capabilities nowhere has the combination of over  pilots designated barge lanes twoway traffic a draft of  feet max beam of  feet air draft of  feet and probably most important somewhere in the neighborhood of  berths the ability to stage a lot of vessels at multiple docks is what really allows ship traffic to move in and out smoothly theres a reason the houston area is considered the energy capital of the world one reason is the houston ship channel another reason is refining capacity that offers producers a domestic market of  million barrels a day of crude and more storage than all other gulf coast locations combined all of these gives producers the two things they value the most full assurance and market choices and with that ill turn it over to bryan bryan f bulawa  enterprise products partners lp thank you jim and good morning everyone i will discuss a few income statement items for the first quarter provide an update on our growth and sustained capital spending for  and wrap up with an overview of our balance sheet metrics and capital raising activities for the quarter but before doing so id like to reiterate comments ive made in the past regarding revenue and seasonality the changes in revenue and operating costs and expenses are largely influenced by changes in commodity prices and are not typically an accurate depiction of the partnerships performance in contrast to the past few quarters the first quarter of  revenue was up  when compared to the same quarter of  while associated costs and expenses were up  we believe total gross operating margin is a better performancebased metric and as jim mentioned it increased  to  billion for the first quarter of  when compared with the first quarter of  also its important to be reminded that the fourth and first quarters are typically our seasonally stronger financial performance quarters now moving along to income items for the quarter net income attributable to limited partners for the first quarter of  was  million or  per unit on a fully diluted basis compared to  million or  per unit on a fully diluted basis for the first quarter of  it was a relatively clean quarter with no material nonrecurring items total capital spending in the first quarter of  was  million including  million for sustaining capital expenditures for the full year of  we expect organic growth capital expenditures to be approximately  billion to  billion and sustaining capital expenditures to come in right around  million this is slightly elevated from the levels provided during the analyst day given the number of new organic projects weve announced and were mentioned earlier in jims comments in addition we recently closed the previously announced  million acquisition of the midstream assets – midstream business and assets of azure midstream partners through a bankruptcydirected auction process at march   our total debt principal outstanding was  billion the average life of our debt portfolio was  years and our effective average cost of debt was  adjusted ebitda for the  months ended march   was  billion and our consolidated leverage ratio continues to trend lower after peaking near  times in third quarter  for the first quarter of  it was  times after adjusting debt for the  equity treatment ascribed by the rating agencies for the hybrid debt securities and we reduce it further for cash and cash equivalents further when we adjust debt for elevated working capital levels associated with shortterm continuing opportunities across commodities and contracted growth projects under construction our adjusted leverage ratio was just under  and  times respectively for the first quarter of  we retained  million of distributable cash flow and raised  million in net equity proceeds from our distribution reinvestment program our employee unit purchase program and the aftermarket or atm program to that end we had record unaffiliated unitholder participation in our distribution reinvestment program that was paid in february which raised  million in equity proceeds finally our consolidated liquidity was approximately  billion at march   which included available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and unrestricted cash with that ill turn the call back over to randy john randy burkhalter  enterprise products partners lp thank you bryan nicole were ready to take questions from our participants but before we do that let me remind everyone that wed like to limit the questions to one question plus one followup please to give more people time to ask questions go ahead nicole questionandanswer session operator certainly it is now time for the questionandanswer session your first question comes from the line of jean ann salisbury with bernstein jean ann salisbury  sanford c bernstein  co llc hi good morning i just wanted to see if you could give a little more color on how to think about the competitive positioning of your oil gas and ngl pipelines in the permian youve mentioned before that your crude acreage dedication could be a primary feeder to your oil pipeline would those be the same customers on your other pipelines or is it just a totally different set that youre pitching a james teague  enterprise products partners lp i think its a mix some of the customers will be the same but there will be others that will be different jean ann salisbury  sanford c bernstein  co llc okay so the acreage dedications support the crude pipeline but not necessarily the other pipeline a james teague  enterprise products partners lp thats correct they would be individual per pipeline jean ann salisbury  sanford c bernstein  co llc okay thanks and separately i get a lot of questions about whether processing capacity could be a bottleneck in the permian i think youve said before that you dont expect that due to the no permitting and quick build time for the plant but i just wanted to get your latest view on that a james teague  enterprise products partners lp im sorry i missed your question you said what now jean ann salisbury  sanford c bernstein  co llc whether processing capacity could be a bottleneck in the permian anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp not if we have anything to do with it a james teague  enterprise products partners lp thats correct jean ann salisbury  sanford c bernstein  co llc all right thank you operator your next question comes from the line of brandon blossman with tudor tuckering sic pickering holt  co brandon blossman  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc good morning everyone a james teague  enterprise products partners lp good morning brandon brandon blossman  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc lets see ill circle back on the ngl pipeline what just broadly from a macro perspective what are you guys seeing in terms of takeaway capacity over the next five years for ngls out of the permian and are you thinking – how do you think about market share gains relative to your competitors over that fiveyear period for ngl takeaway in the basin anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp brandon this is tony when we made our announcement on our ngl pipeline we said it was expandable and as we see the numbers at current drilling rates that we think theres a good chance that over the time period that you discussed that we will be expanding it thats how we see it brandon blossman  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc okay fair enough related topic the texas interstate system – natural gas system – saw a downtick yearoveryear whats and probably for tony whats the trajectory there from your expectations going forward bradley motal  enterprise products partners lp hi this is brad i think that from a trajectory perspective we – kind of seen the bottom and i suspect that well start to see some upside on a goforward basis as we maximize the use of the pipes out of the permian going east and south and then with the pickup of the eagle ford we should see some revenue growth there as well brandon blossman  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc okay thats my two ill circle back thanks guys operator your next question comes from the line of tj schultz with rbc capital markets tj schultz  rbc capital markets llc great thanks good morning i guess just first if you can give any update on centennial just discussions with customers on needs for diversification and how much that may ultimately play into the dynamic i guess just to find a second market for ngls a james teague  enterprise products partners lp well the centennial project is a slow play right now these projects require a multitude of players to be involved they have fast phases and slow phases and were in slow phase weve suspended work in the field were pressing on with our negotiations with shippers northeast producers that want additional access to the gulf coast market for their propane and were calling on other people to see if they would be interested to be shippers and when theres sufficient volume demand therell be a project i think were a long way from talking about abandonment but until theres a volume at acceptable levels to justify a project it wont go forward but the good news i think in that is that because of the acceptable range of volumes that would justify the high end of that is very realistic it should be just a matter of timing but until its there until the demands there theres no project in a nutshell tj were not going to chase it if people want it well do it but were not going to chase it tj schultz  rbc capital markets llc okay that makes sense i guess second would just be on the eagle ford and haynesville you spent some time there so you see leases turning over you just bought the azure assets i guess are there other assets in those particular basins that you think make sense potentially from an ma perspective or is azure kind of a oneoff and the message is just that more that theres open capacity right now in your system that youll participate in with minimal capex a james teague  enterprise products partners lp i think azure was a unique situation that fit us like a glove and i think that the eagle ford wed like to see production come back more tony thinks it will weve got plenty of capacity to handle it without doing a heck of a lot in the permian we found that its more economical to build than to get caught up in the frenzy of paying high premiums for existing assets tj schultz  rbc capital markets llc okay great thanks guys operator your next question comes from the line of kristina kazarian with deutsche bank kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc good morning guys a james teague  enterprise products partners lp good morning kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc jim you started off talking about the multiyear period of petchem demand growth that were going into and i know you guys announced a handful of new projects in the quarter but maybe could you talk high level about like what the next set of major infrastructure needs or projects epd is kind of focused on to meet these needs and i guess most importantly how big could this opportunity be a james teague  enterprise products partners lp well with pdh and ibdh its pretty big already kristina but from an ethylene perspective i think what rb and his groups putting together is kind of sticking your toe in the water to see where we can go with ethylene logistics i think putting together a storage system that the entire gulf coast can use putting together a distribution system is a first step now we rb has worked tirelessly on ethylene export but the question there is how long is this market how long is it with ethylene for how long and well keep working that and see where it goes but right now we just kind of like what were doing just a minute im getting a note and then tonys reminding me that he thinks that theres a second wave of crackers that will be built in the us he doesnt think were through building crackers which will be supportive of us putting together kind of an ethylene hub and distribution center and will be supportive of our ethylene delivery infrastructure kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc perfect so i guess my followup will be maybe just timeframe on those latter two points so timeframe to developing a lot of the infrastructure needed to handling the end products on the ethylene side and maybe timeframe to tonys second wave of crackers that maybe might be coming anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp this is tony so relative to the second wave were watching the announcements quasiannouncements like everyone else so lets think in the early s thats what we expect and then relative to hub activities rb will take it roger b herrscher  enterprise products partners lp yeah were currently developing the pipeline transportation and the storage if the ethylene terminal goes if the demand is there it will go but a lot of the crackers focus a lot on their feedstock supply and their derivative capacity and what we have found is theres a little bit of a gap there on the ethylene side of the business that were trying to fill their needs kristina kazarian  deutsche bank securities inc perfect guys hope you win all of them thanks guys operator your next question comes from the line of darren horowitz with raymond james darren c horowitz  raymond james  associates inc good morning guys jim maybe a question for you or tony id like your thoughts on the expectations that propane balances possibly could meaningfully tighten this winter and what you think about the impact on market dynamics and pricing specifically if we dont have enough us supply to meet lpg exports running at  barrels or  barrels a day without drawing down inventories how do you guys think about capitalizing on what could be a very profitable arbitrage of securing propane nearterm storing it at belvieu selling it forward especially if were heading into a scenario where mont belvieu propane could sell at a premium to like northwest europe a james teague  enterprise products partners lp hey darren i wondered where you were darren c horowitz  raymond james  associates inc i did too jim a james teague  enterprise products partners lp and you didnt start out with saying nice quarter have you been hanging out with our ngl marketing guys darren c horowitz  raymond james  associates inc as much as i can a james teague  enterprise products partners lp now youre speaking of contango obviously and we did quite a lot of contango last year tuck  we havent done – frankly we havent had the opportunity to do as much i dont think the first quarter as we did last year but it is in our playbook and the beauty of our system is when you have things like weve had the last couple of years invariably it creates other opportunities that arent otherwise there contango being one of them and weve got a system that can capitalize on that big time brent tuck  anything brent b secrest  enterprise products partners lp well i think youre deadon this is brent talking the market has not told propane that it needs to be stored yet and so youre starting to see some stuff happen youre starting to see just from the industry talk cancellations happen this month and yeah for the month of may but ultimately i think youre spoton the market will tell propane that it needs to be stored so that they can get geared up for this winter darren c horowitz  raymond james  associates inc hey jim by the way good quarter thats all i had thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of matthew phillips with guggenheim partners matthew phillips  guggenheim securities good morning guys so continuing on the petchem theme tony alluded to it before but exxon recently announced the possibility of a new cracker down near corpus christi you all have a frac in nueces county i mean do you – that part of texas is fairly light in ngl infrastructure i mean do you see the room for more of a buildup there whether its your own assets or acquiring thirdparty assets a james teague  enterprise products partners lp if they build that monster were certainly going to be in there pitching a system to supply it if you look at – we say it a lot for ngls were tied to every ethylene plant in the united states were very proud of that and were not going to let an ethylene plant come online that we dont have some kind of access to matthew phillips  guggenheim securities would it make more sense to extend aegis that way or would you build a bespoke frac for a plant like that a james teague  enterprise products partners lp well the reality is we – from mont belvieu down to south texas we have a inch pipeline in ethane service thats bidirectional so we call aegis from mont belvieu to the river the reality is weve got an ethane header from corpus to the mississippi river so were positioned to do some but if they build what they say theyre going to build what is it tony over  barrels i think anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp over  barrels a day a james teague  enterprise products partners lp theyre going to need an infrastructure i bet were talking to them out there matthew phillips  guggenheim securities to that point i mean the fact that exxon and sabic would build a plant of that size does that kind of throw some cold water on the idea that were going to be tight ethane anytime in the next five six seven years a james teague  enterprise products partners lp personally ill let tony weigh in but as i look at all the associated gas and rich gas im having a hard time thinking were going to run out of ethane anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp yes our balances for ethane and we published them at the analyst meeting changed considerably over the last year so we have a slide we published it in our investor materials all the time as to how we see it and its – the situation is much better than it was before and out of the shales ethane is plentiful and getting more plentiful all of the time matthew phillips  guggenheim securities you mean much better from a supply perspective anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp yes yes matthew phillips  guggenheim securities okay anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp thats correct matthew phillips  guggenheim securities okay got it thank you anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp matt i guess i want to add one other thing jim alluded to infrastructure when we look at the second wave of crackers they need services that particularly around storage and transportation that are offered in and out of mont belvieu so i personally dont believe that youre going to disconnect mont belvieu from anything that happens further south just like you didnt disconnect it from whats happening in louisiana matthew phillips  guggenheim securities does it make sense for you to – would it dilute your turns to build a frac further south than i would at mont belvieu at this point a james teague  enterprise products partners lp no matthew phillips  guggenheim securities okay thank you operator your next question comes from ted durbin with goldman sachs theodore durbin  goldman sachs  co thanks just coming back to the permian and the gas takeaway question i guess can you quantify how much gas youre moving or can you move right now on the texas intrastates is it because youve got a lot of capacity on that system but its hard to know exactly how much can come up right now before you get your new gas line built a james teague  enterprise products partners lp brad bradley motal  enterprise products partners lp yeah we can move – weve got the two pipes the inch and the inch we can move over  bcf a day away from the area as it sits today what i can tell you is on a daily basis we run fairly full already because weve seen the volume start to show up so theodore durbin  goldman sachs  co okay thats helpful thanks and then second question is when you think about whether its a permian gas pipe or an ngl pipe this mandate to use american steel i think you mentioned that you always use american steel but im just curious about your thoughts on the costs as they kind of come through the industry how that might impact your ability to pass on if there are higher costs and earn the returns on capital that you want to earn a james teague  enterprise products partners lp were going to adjust the kind of deals we do based on what our costs are the one thing is we – the fact that weve had a real initiative to build kevin  for the last eight ten years that we were going to buy american weve developed pretty good relationships with the mills and we think that gives us an advantage kevin  youve got anything to add i mean yeah more demand probably increases costs but american capitalism is pretty neat it has a way of making it up unknown speaker yeah weve been successful so far we havent had the big you know price problems and as you know weve bought american on virtually all our major projects for some time theodore durbin  goldman sachs  co okay ill leave it at that thank you a james teague  enterprise products partners lp weve got an american flag in here in the conference room you know operator your next question comes from the line of shneur gershuni with ubs shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc hi good morning guys a lot of my questions have been asked and answered but maybe just a quick followup i think kristina asked earlier about potential project opportunities and so forth you know excluding the gas pipeline that youre thinking about out of waha is there kind of a number that were thinking about in terms of how big the backlog could potentially get to are we talking  billion to  billion more are we talking something on the scale of  billion to  billion im just wondering if you can sort of give us a frame of reference a james teague  enterprise products partners lp well i think our biggest problem is holding our people back we never talk about our backlog we dont publish that at all weve got this many billions of dollars of backlog but we seem to always – if we think were going to spend a  billion two years from now when we get there its usually a lot more shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc i mean is there kind of like a capacity that you feel that you can handle on an annual basis  billion to  billion is kind of your max capacity that your staff can handle or do you think that you can do something bigger than that bryan f bulawa  enterprise products partners lp this is bryan weve had in the past weve handled quite handily  billion to  billion without thirdparty acquisitions and i think with our size and the access to capital markets to the extent theres opportunity there we dont really see it as being a huge limiting factor of course well always instill the discipline that weve demonstrated over the years with respect to our balance sheet and approach in dcf coverage shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc very helpful and then just in terms of financing and equity needs and so forth youve had a pretty decent quarter – or pretty good quarter actually – in terms of ebitda and dcf and so forth does this take down your equity needs for this year youve talked about being selffunding in  has that timeframe moved at all either up or backwards just given the changes to your capex forecast bryan f bulawa  enterprise products partners lp well just on your latter notion with respect to yes being selffunded is dependent upon a recovery and of course were on that the winds not quite fully at our back at this point but we are continuing to spend and find the opportunities so the more opportunities we find the less likely well be fully selffunded but our equity needs still as we look forward into  remain light and as far as this year pretty much the last three quarters are a pretty good indication of the range of activity that we might have with respect to raising thirdparty equity shneur z gershuni  ubs securities llc perfect thank you very much guys really appreciate the color operator your next question comes from the line of brian zarahn with mizuho brian joshua zarahn  mizuho securities usa inc on the chinook  project you secured customer contracts from a high level how do you view producer willingness to sign contracts for existing projects and potential future projects a james teague  enterprise products partners lp if you look at that pipeline the most reliable supply that you can have for a pipeline is that that comes out of your own plants which should tell you something about our plans in the delaware permian from a processing perspective brian joshua zarahn  mizuho securities usa inc understood i guess maybe trying to extend throughout your other projects how do you view the producer willingness to increase their contracted capacity so for example midlandtosealy a james teague  enterprise products partners lp yeah midlandtosealy i think were going to be fine we originally said that pipeline was going to come on at  barrels a day we have opted to take it up to its full  barrel a day capacity we did that because we feel like  barrels well be at easily and theres room to grow were talking to a lot of folks theres a lot of interest i think a lot of the reason theres interest it isnt just that they are signing up for a pipeline theyre signing up for a system that gets them to the water on the houston ship channel that gets them to a market that has  million barrels a day of refining capacity and gets them to a location that has tons of storage so what theyre looking at i think is this is ideal for giving me the flow assurance that i want and the ability to market my crude to a variety of customers brian joshua zarahn  mizuho securities usa inc along those lines on crude exports weve seen significant growth this year and assuming the eia data is correct exceeding over  million barrels a day at times how do you view the crude export opportunity given the current spread environment and do you have enough capacity in the future to accommodate expected permian production growth to load vessels a james teague  enterprise products partners lp go ahead bob  laurie h argo  enterprise products partners lp i feel like we have plenty of capacity to handle it and ill let brent speak to our future potential for crude exports a james teague  enterprise products partners lp how much crude could we load today without spending a dime laurie h argo  enterprise products partners lp four million barrels a day brent b secrest  enterprise products partners lp yeah four million barrels a day across all the terminals and that can be increased for minimal dollar impact a james teague  enterprise products partners lp on the our  piece for a while last year we had structural working for us and so we were doing quite a few exports just based on structure not based on brent wti spreads but as structures come in youre seeing these spreads widen youre seeing it widen all the way down the curve our belief much like we said at the analyst meeting is that these barrels have to clear on the water theres only so much demand here domestically for this light sweet crude it is the cheapest barrel thats going to be out there for the global market and ultimately this barrel its not justified to be stored so wheres the next move it goes out by the water brian joshua zarahn  mizuho securities usa inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jeremy tonet with jpmorgan jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc good morning a james teague  enterprise products partners lp hey jeremy jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc just wanted to touch on waha basis youve talked about this a bit here but just wondering if you could walk me through how to think about what stops that basis from widening out at this point youve really seen it move and just what can you guys do to capitalize on that in the near term i guess a james teague  enterprise products partners lp brent brent b secrest  enterprise products partners lp waha basis a james teague  enterprise products partners lp yes brent b secrest  enterprise products partners lp hes talking gas a james teague  enterprise products partners lp oh gas brad bradley motal  enterprise products partners lp weve got a little bit left i guess id say in the near term as far as this basis or pipeline capacity to take advantage of the basis but for the most part we have sold that capacity on a firm basis away so its – a lot of the daytoday business that we do is not basisoriented between waha and south texas a james teague  enterprise products partners lp i think one of the things we can do to take advantage of it is and others are trying is they are given present an opportunity to have more infrastructure out of there jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc so does the basis just anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp yes this is – jeremy this is tony when you look at the forward markets on basis for the waha area the markets already telling you capacity is tight and going to get tighter infrastructure is required to solve this problem jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc great thanks and then just one followup youve talked about in the past just wondered if you had any updated thoughts to share with regards to any potential in the future to adopt a dual c corp currency to kind of broaden investor access to enterprise bryan f bulawa  enterprise products partners lp yeah jeremy thats something that well continue to evaluate it but really no update jeremy b tonet  jpmorgan securities llc great thanks thats it from me operator your next question comes from the line of faisel khan with citigroup faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc good morning guys a james teague  enterprise products partners lp good morning faisel faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc i had two questions but then you threw out this  million barreladay crude oil export number i just want to clarify that is that just crude oil or is that – youre talking about total liquids where its products and crude oil and condensate i mean my understanding is you have to have segregated tanks youve got to sort of – you cant just – theyre not  interchangeable i just want to make sure i understood your comment on the  million a day a james teague  enterprise products partners lp i would tell you the  million barrel a day does relate to all the commodities you referenced but as far as you dont necessarily have to have completely segregated tanks if you have the ability to completely drain a tank to load a ship so its a clean tank for the next product and that is across the system in that regard it does not include refrigerated products in that number faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc right but if youre already exporting sort of – the us exporting  million barrels a day of total liquids products i mean its displacement right you cant just like – if the product was in there to be exported then you would have the excess capacity for crude but you have to actually have both right a james teague  enterprise products partners lp his number doesnt have anything to do with lpg if thats what youre asking about faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc sure no but for the products right we export what the extra two three million barrels a day of product so im just trying to figure out how much excess capacity you have to move crude i guess thats the – yeah thats the more critical number as we grow production and keep product exports growing too right anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp faisal this is tony from a fundamental standpoint youre either going to export more crude or more refined product not both right and the behavior of the refineries isnt that theyre going to massively expand so if we look at that capacity and say whats the guess if you will as to whether or not its going to export crude or refined products because it wont be both we think that crude oil exports are the one that are the game just because the refineries arent adding all over the united states we just dont see that faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc okay sure no okay thats fair enough and last question just on the midlandtosealy pipeline going back to your comments so do you have the – i think at the analyst day you commented that you didnt have the  barrels a day of contracts in hand but that you were sort of very close to sort of inking those deals has that been done yet laurie h argo  enterprise products partners lp yes we – well we have the  barrels a day filled of capacity and we actually think that well be at the  barrels a day capacity upon startup faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc sure i mean my question was on the contracts though are the contracts at capacity laurie h argo  enterprise products partners lp yes a james teague  enterprise products partners lp what shes saying is weve got laurie h argo  enterprise products partners lp were up to  barrels a day a james teague  enterprise products partners lp yeah faisel h khan  citigroup global markets inc okay okay got it okay makes sense okay thats it for me guys thanks a lot operator your next question comes from the line of michael bushi with tiaa  unknown speaker hi good morning gentlemen great quarter i wanted to talk about the capex number that was up a little bit from the analyst day is that  capex getting pulled forward or do you see new opportunities and following up do you expect if it is getting pulled forward from  to replace that in  thanks bryan f bulawa  enterprise products partners lp michael  this is bryan that is not pulling  forward that is just the addition of the projects that have been added that has moved the  number up so also clearly we didnt talk about  but our  number has also moved up unknown speaker great great bryan f bulawa  enterprise products partners lp yeah unknown speaker thats very helpful thank you operator your next question comes from the line of barrett blaschke with mufg securities barrett blaschke  mufg securities america inc hey guys just wanted to followup on the commentary about a second round of cracker buildup kind of timeline for that and do you see it as all being gulf coast or do you see the east coast finally trying to develop more of a local market around the volumes that are being produced up there anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp this is tony so we see the timeline as early s and as we look at the projects for now we see it as all being gulf coast barrett blaschke  mufg securities america inc so no thoughts on – i guess that all tries to remain an export market as it builds out anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp up in the northeast barrett blaschke  mufg securities america inc yes anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp yes sir thats how we see it barrett blaschke  mufg securities america inc okay thank you anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of chris sighinolfi with jefferies christopher paul sighinolfi  jefferies llc hey good morning jim a james teague  enterprise products partners lp good morning christopher paul sighinolfi  jefferies llc appreciate the comments about the many attributes of the ship channel i was intrigued by the conversation earlier on the call about export capacity so i just wanted to try and clarify that  million barrel a day number that you quoted im just trying to reference that relative to lets say what the q volume was so if i just think crude and refined products somewhere in the neighborhood of  million barrels a day is that the right sort of starting reference point to think about your headroom without meaningful capital spend a james teague  enterprise products partners lp yes thats probably in the ballpark yes christopher paul sighinolfi  jefferies llc okay okay and then second just – or as a quick followup the number that you quoted for crude export last night or i guess this morning  –  barrels a day was just slightly different than the number that i saw in the release in april so i was just wondering if it was just a difference in definition or if i misinterpreted something or any help in clarifying that would be helpful john randy burkhalter  enterprise products partners lp yes this is randy the press release that we put out in march was reflecting gross barrels and then what we referred to in the press release thats more our economic barrels or net our netted christopher paul sighinolfi  jefferies llc okay okay perfect perfect and a final just followup on exports jim your comments in the release you had talked about morgans point ramping to sort of  barrel a day level by sort of the end of the year just curious i know your slide presentation had sort of indicated around that range as an average for  but you had mentioned in those presentation slides the opportunity of shippers to sort of flex around customer elections might change im just curious if im reading just way too much into your comment and nothings changed or if there were any maybe changes in the election a james teague  enterprise products partners lp i think youre probably reading a little much into it christopher paul sighinolfi  jefferies llc okay im at risk of doing that at times so thats fair all right thanks a lot guys appreciate it john randy burkhalter  enterprise products partners lp nicole this is randy i think we have time for one more question operator okay and your final question comes from the line of john edwards with credit suisse john edwards  credit suisse good morning guys thanks for taking my question just on the second wave of steam crackers in terms of size i guess this first wave was around  barrels give or take of incremental ethane demand so maybe tony you can tell us whats – how big you see that second wave in terms of ethane demand a james teague  enterprise products partners lp john this is jim and ill turn over to tony you know theres a basic assumption that is the gas to crude spread so if youre assuming second wave youre assuming a wide gas to crude spread which frankly we do but that can – you have crude fall relative to gas so thats a different ballgame but we think it wont so tony anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp right yes so we have been on the bandwagon that the us has ample natural gas for a considerable time but relative to the question the projects that we are monitoring today have call it between  to  barrels of incremental demand those are the handful that were monitoring today as im going to call them prospects okay john edwards  credit suisse okay a james teague  enterprise products partners lp and that would include exxon sabic tony anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp yes sir it would john edwards  credit suisse okay now does that include shells cracker in the northeast or no anthony c chovanec  enterprise products partners lp those are the existing wave those are being built theyre under construction this is the second wave john edwards  credit suisse okay all right fair enough and then just i guess for my second question jim you made the comment better to build than buy in the permian so you know i just thought maybe you could give us a little more insight into the permian opportunity i mean obviously youve talked about some of these with the – your midlandtosealy pipelines are you think is going to hit  barrels per day by the third quarter obviously very bullish there so any other comments you can make around opportunities that youre seeing in the permian and how enterprise can take advantage a james teague  enterprise products partners lp were building a truck line upstream of midland what is that laurie how long is that pipe that youre building up the loving county laurie h argo  enterprise products partners lp from loving county into midland about  miles  miles  miles a james teague  enterprise products partners lp all right so we are building upstream of midland were being very disciplined and im – i mean heck i dont know were pretty sold on the place were pretty proud of our position i really dont know how to answer the question other than we continue to build out there in both crude gas and ngls john edwards  credit suisse okay fair enough thank you john randy burkhalter  enterprise products partners lp thank you nicole if you would give
