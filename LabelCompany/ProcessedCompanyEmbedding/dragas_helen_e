writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate

university of virginia board of visitors by then governor tim kaine in  she became rector of the board on july   and was the first woman ever to be elected to the post it’s been noted that dragas’ state service was uncontroversial until she made headlines in june  as part of the resignation of uva president teresa a sullivan sullivan announced her resignation as president in early june after only two years in the position citing philosophical differences with the board of visitors as her reasoning media outlets had reported that the rift between sullivan and the board may have been in part due to dragas viewpoint that the university was facing serious financial challenges and that the administration would need to explore fiscally conservative solutions something sullivan was not actively pursuing a washington post story and a uva student newspaper story had both claimed that dragas organized the support necessary to oust sullivan as president after the resignation dragas assured the community that the board was unified in its actions but some board members later claimed that they had no knowledge of the sullivan decision until just before her resignation a former board member randal kirk publicly stated that he and others believed that sullivan was the wrong pick from the start public records later revealed that a supermajority of the board supported the change in leadership based on personnel reasons dragas became the center of attention for those who supported sullivan in their expression of dismay according to a public records release there were over  emails sent calling for dragas to resign as rector additionally the faculty senate of uva passed a resolution supporting sullivan and expressing a lack of confidence in dragas a newspaper report would later reveal that sullivan’s supporters mobilized by john o “dubby” wynne a former uva rector who had originally hired sullivan had established “a ‘war room’ on grounds where they organized a counterattack focusing on influential alumni and wavering board members” following the vote dragas offered to meet with the faculty senate to discuss the matter and a meeting took place on june   according to a statement by the faculty senate the meeting was cordial but the faculty senate still demanded both the reinstatement of sullivan and the resignation of dragas as the situation escalated governor bob mcdonnell made a statement that if the board of visitors did not resolve the issue by their june  meeting he would use his power of appointment to replace all of the board members at the june th meeting the board unanimously voted to reinstate sullivan as president while emails show that dragas had considered resigning from her position as rector during the height of the situation she was subsequently reappointed to another term on the board by governor mcdonnell and has released a joint statement with sullivan to demonstrate a shared commitment to moving on to solving the universitys problems reconfirmationedit dragas was reconfirmed in january  a march   washington post article reported that days after virginia lawmakers confirmed dragas’s reappointment to the board in january the rector sent the president a lengthy and detailed list of goals to meet this school year sullivan claimed that the letter was inappropriate and constituted micromanagement the american association of university professors aaup issued a report on march   criticizing the actions of the board in general and dragas in particular the report stated that dragas was not prepared for the disruptive influence of online education that she had previously made uninformed statements and that she seemed inexperienced in her position  it was noted that the report contained “multiple errors of fact” the american council of trustees and alumni later praised the work of dragas and the board stating that “if students are to receive a quality and affordable education in virginia it is the trustees who are going to have to press for measure and demand results dragas’ financial support of the university has been documented noting that she has donated nearly half a million dollars to the university “but she considers herself a voice for the states lower and middleincome families” added one news report in april  dragas was on the losing end of a  vote to raise tuition claiming that the rise in tuition was putting the school on an unsustainable track dragas argued that tuition was rising faster than the income of virginia families so could become a barrier to postsecondary education end of tenureedit the washington post wrote that the ouster of sullivan served to be beneficial for the university in terms of developing an attitude in favor of long term change in an exit interview from the position dragas stated that i believe we did the right thing in that we pushed for needed change  we did it the wrong way in that we misunderstood that when youre going to try to solve thorney problems at a highprofile public institution you need to communicate a lot  a lot more than we did  and with a lot of people and that was a lesson that i in particular and the board learned the hard way her term as rector ended at the end of june  though she remains a member of the board in august  dragas was one of only two members of the board of visitors to vote against scaling back the university’s financial aid program access uva which assured lowincome students could graduate without debt the uva student council submitted a letter echoing dragas requesting the program be maintained as it has operated for nine years following the decision ms dragas maintained her opposition to the measure stating that “this action raises the cost of a uva degree substantially for students from lowincome families hurting our diversity and coming at a time when we are already seen as elitist and unwelcoming” some alumni and students have begun organizing support and sending emails to administrators in an effort to reverse the decision in september  dragas was noted for further expressing her opposition to tuition increases in the aftermath of a meeting between foundation representatives administrators deans and some board members who are advocates for raising instate student tuition later in the fall at a november meeting dragas urged her fellow board members to delay approving elements of a new strategic plan reiterating a need for more discussion on the plan’s potential impacts to tuition and financial aid dragas specifically raised a concern about several years of doubledigit tuition increases following comments for the university’s president that the possibility of tuition increases have not been ruled out to pay for parts of the strategic plan especially improvements to curriculum and student engagement ms dragas was featured in hampton road magazine’s list of “ leading ladies” featuring the advice of powerful and inspiring women she further mentioned the importance of affordable tuition by attributing her success and inspiration to the fact that she and her family “were able to afford the cost of a lifechanging undergraduate and graduate education at the university of virginia advocacy on affordabilityedit throughout  dragas was further recognized for her advocacy of affordable higher education dragas has been joined by other members of the board in raising concerns that the university has relied too much on yearly tuition increases to backfill stagnant state funding lack of strategic planning and declining research dragas and fellow board members have also pointed to the university’s lack of a longterm financial plan as one reason for the continued escalation of tuition in response in june  the uva board of visitors set up a special subcommittee to work on a longrange plan targeting affordability for students during a june meeting of the uva board of visitors dragas again raised the issue of the university’s public mission to provide affordable access to virginians arguing that board members owe their primary duty of loyalty to the public and then to the university a newspaper article on the meeting pointed to tuition increases as an example which may limit access to virginians with lower incomes but help the university administration avoid difficult budget decisions one virginia newspaper the daily progress cheered “hooray for helen dragas” and editorialized that dragas was “spoton in saying that the university of virginia including its governing board should put the public interest first” calling her “right on the money on these issues” the progress also agreed with dragas that a proposed code of conduct muzzling board member expression of dissenting views would be an unrighteous

 at a meeting of the university of virginia board of visitors dragas who led an unsuccessful effort that year to oust uva president teresa a sullivan recently left the board after eight years ap photosteve helber helen e dragas a hampton roads businesswoman was appointed to the university of virginia’s governing board in  by thengov timothy m kaine d she was reappointed by thengov robert f mcdonnell r in  she led the board of visitors as uva’s first female rector from  to  her term on the board ended june  here she offers a parting viewpoint on the direction of the public flagship university key player in the  leadership drama at uva leaves the school’s board by helen e dragas regular citizens here and around the world are expressing disapproval of their lack of control over crushing policies made by the disconnected elite with national student loan debt exceeding  trillion american students and families must feel frustrations similar to those vented across the atlantic in the recent brexit vote after an eightyear term on the board of visitors at the university of virginia i can confidently attest that this disconnect is alive and well at the commonwealth’s flagship despite significant growth in state and federal funding the board has voted to raise tuition for new students by  percent since  administrators regularly seek — and get — annual raises for faculty well above the rate of inflation while some secretarial and administrative staff earn more than the governor of virginia the median family income in the state remains stuck in the mid’s it’s easy for accomplished and wealthy board members — including me — to sit around a fancy oval table and pass judgment about what’s affordable or what’s not but we don’t walk in the shoes of everyday virginia parents struggling to keep body and soul together and a child or more in college and accolades of “best value” regularly received by uva fall flat on the ears of students for whom all choices are a financial strain earlier this year just before leaving home for a board of visitors event a google alert linked me to a story about a uva student forced to beg online for help to pay her tuition and to eat in anybody’s book that should be shameful a keen sense of moral unease deadened my appetite as i later dined with my fellow board members administrators and deans on crab cakes filet mignon and designer desserts in a luxury country inn owned by the university without doubt the forces of growing income inequality increasing diversity soaring costs technological changes and global influences have come home to roost in charlottesville in fact the commonwealth is a microcosm of the country we are well off and not we are black and white and brown and every other color of the rainbow we are global citizens but there’s one thing virginia’s families have in common and that’s the desire to create opportunities for the next generation to grow and prosper and to do so without mortgaging the future its founding dna imprints uva as a very public institution with what should be a very public responsibility yet since  the university has raised instate tuition by  percent cut grant aid to the poorest virginians formed an administrative committee to explore secession from the state hired a private university governance consultant for  spent more than  million on financial aid to outofstate students raised the net price for some virginia families to subsidize others and proposed gagging board members from talking to legislators the press and the public thousands of virginia students who seek admission are denied a coveted spot every year the university of virginia is slowly being privatized as a native virginian whose family’s tax dollars have supported the commonwealth for decades watching this process unfold from a front row seat has been excruciatingly painful at our june meeting administrators revealed their coffers include a  billion pot of reserves surpluses and earnings that for years has been hidden in plain sight loosely labeled as necessary to support operations now through financial maneuvering this treasury has been liberated expressly to support strategic initiatives that will enhance the university’s reputation as administrators requested a series of board actions to facilitate that change members were not apprised of the large sum at stake only later did we learn that these moves had created a  billion slush fund privately referred to as “unfound money” that is unfound by legislators the press and — as a result — the general public this astounding sum could run the entire university academic division for a year and a half it would pay the fouryear tuition bills for  virginia students it is  percent more than the market value of all of uva’s year buildup of educational and general program buildings and facilities a conservative estimate of its annual earnings potential —  million — could be used to cut the tuition of all instate undergraduates by  percent while others and i have made futile requests for more detail on these funds — with a top administrator recently citing fear that the originating sources would try to reclaim them — credit belongs to the current rector william goodwin for tenaciously pressing administrators for transparency about this astounding accumulation but to consider hoarding a multibilliondollar slush fund for pet projects doesn’t reflect reality by way of example one recent proposal suggested a  million program for selfcare training to include journaling meditation and yoga for nursing students proper public use of this public gold mine and funds received by the university from any source become public dollars could put an excellent education within reach of more middle and lowerincome students look outside many of virginia’s families are already drowning in tuition debt that robs graduates of the opportunity to gain basic independence let alone start small businesses that virginia so desperately needs for economic growth it’s wrong when reputational rankings in magazines matter more than serving virginians but when public universities are run like private academic playgrounds and boards act as unelected taxing authorities perhaps it’s time for a higher power to weigh in i believe there’s a better way to do business in virginia governor mcauliffe and the general assembly should make strengthening transparency and accountability a priority for the  session through a few simple measures first they should ensure that the women and men appointed to serve our public colleges understand and pledge to uphold their primary duty to virginia citizens requiring significantly more rigorous orientation and training delivered by independent objective sources would help board members see through a wider lens than that of administrators having witnessed abuse of virginia’s sunshine laws by outofstate appointees in order to increase instate tuition by double digits i believe legislators should stipulate that only virginians be allowed to serve as board officers and chairs of certain critical committees the socalled “legislative liaisons” employed directly by colleges and universities should be subject to the same registration and reporting laws as all lobbyists and the records of all officers — including college presidents — should be subject to virginia’s freedom of information act finally requiring public comment periods at board meetings and creating accountability back to the taxpayers they serve would bring higher education into the modern world of governance these steps alone could help ensure that uva remains true to its yearold mandate in the meantime its leaders should voluntarily reclaim its historic public heritage by denouncing the rankings and embracing an identity that is more diverse more affordable more accessible and more nimble in adjusting to the dynamics of today’s learners let’s keep our public treasures
