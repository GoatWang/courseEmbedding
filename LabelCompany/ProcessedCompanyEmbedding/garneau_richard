the cautionary statements in our press release and on slide number two of todays presentation richard garneau good morning and thank you for joining us we generated adjusted ebitda of  million for the quarter compared million in the fourth quarter of  our results were supported by higher prices in our wood product segment and significantly lower unplanned maintenance expenses when compared to the previous quarter on the other hand higher costs related to seasonally higher energy expenses sga adjustment and lower volume mainly in newsprints negatively impacted our financial performance by segment we generated adjusted ebitda of  million in market pulp an improvement of  million against the previous quarter  million from our tissue operations  million in wood products compared to  million in q  in newsprint down by  million and  million in specialty papers up by  million even as demand declines continue in our paper segments and unfair trade action on supercalendered paper negatively affected our cash position we will report improvements in segments focussed on growth markets namely pulp wood product and tissue which collectively generated an increase in ebitda of  million when compared to q in our pulp segments we experienced a reduction in unplanned downtime which allowed us to reduce cost despite several price increase announcements throughout the quarter pricing was only up slightly compared to the fourth quarter in tissue we had achieved important milestones first we successfully started out our new machine at calhoun nearly a month ahead of our original schedule we are now able to support our sales efforts with our own product samples and will be in a better position to compete in the retail business bidding cycle at atlas we are also making progress by delivering positive ebtida this quarter as for our wood product business it continued to demonstrate very solid results thanks to strong pricing in part due to market expectation of countervailing duties on export in our paper segments market conditions continue to deteriorate which led to the permanent closure of mokpo and the indefinite idling of thorold during the quarter nevertheless our speciality paper segment benefitted from lower maintenance and chemical cost which led to an increase in ebitda despite reduction in pricing let’s review our individual segments starting with market pulp world demand for chemical pulp grew by  in the quarter compared to the same period of  demand in china and north america rose  and  respectively while western europe declined by  specifically for softwood kraft demand increased by  globally with china rising  north america  and western europe declining  operating rates were solid in the quarter for softwood kraft mills reaching  for hardwood grades we saw global demand growth of  entirely due to china which recorded an increase of  during the quarter compared to q of  demand in north america and western europe both declined by  and  respectively after falling during the fourth quarter of  our realized pricing gradually increased from the lows of last december reversing the trend and resulting in a small increase over the fourth quarter average pricing our maintenance improvement efforts resulted in lower overall cost reduction in unplanned repair led to a  million reduction in costs for the segment however total shipments fell by  metric tons due in part to catawba annual maintenance shutdown taking place at the end of march in the first quarter total tissue consumption in the us grew by  against the same period last year away from home shipments increased  while at home volume grew  at atlas our volume growth of  was entirely driven by parent rolls and we achieved a positive ebitda for the segment in the quarter one of the highlights was the start up of our calhoun integrated tissue operation the facility started production in structure mode which not only represent a world first of this technology but also allowed us to produce premium products right from the start the tissue machine is manufacturing quality products from how to indiscernible internally supply pulp we are now focused on ramping up production and accelerating sales we have firm orders with important retailers which will be shipped in the coming quarters growth in the us housing market continued in the first quarter overall seasonally adjusted housing start in the us rose by  with single family starts increasing by  on average when compared to the fourth quarter new home sales also increased significantly rising  on average when compared to q influenced by market expectations on softwood lumber duties market pricing rose during the quarter our overall realized price in the segment increased by  to thousand board feet compared to the fourth quarter despite adverse weather condition our shipments exceeded half a billion board feet for the third consecutive quarter our profitability was impacted by higher log cost and production curtailment overall ebitda was  million for the quarter compared to  million in the fourth quarter and only  million in the first quarter of  the us department of commerce imposed countervailing duties of  on the company’s export of softwood lumber effective april  we find this decision to be baseless ignoring the regulatory changes made in quebec forestry system in  making it the market base and that indiscernible nafta panel ruling confirming the absence of sub cities in ontario residual system we expect that the final duty of termination will recognize these elements north american demand from newsprint fell by  in the first quarter compared to the same period of  exports declined  over the same period as global demand went down  even as north american consumption continues to decline the industry production to capacity ratio was  our newsprint shipments fell by  metric tonnes when compared to the fourth quarter and this reduction is mostly explained by the permanent closure of mokpo and the definitive idling of thorold pricing slid by  per metric ton during the quarter which was mainly attributable to our export business and the weakness of global currencies against the us dollars the other root cause in the segment rose by  per metric ton compared to the previous quarter this was mostly the result of lower volumes and higher distribution and energy costs which were partially offset by lower maintenance and a reduction in fixed cost this led to a reduction in ebitda of  million down to  million north american demand for uncoated mechanical papers was down by  in the quarter compared to the same period last year markets for supercalendered papers led this decline dropping  while other uncoated grades fell  industry production fell  compared to  this resulted in a shipment to capacity ratio of  for the quarter market conditions in coated mechanical grades continue to deteriorate north american demand fell  during the quarter compared to the same period last year imports also fell by  over the same period and north american production declined by  resulting in a shipment to capacity ratio of  our overall segment pricing fell by  per short ton when compared to the fourth quarter of  impacted by a reduction in demand in supercalendered and coated grades however our shipment increased by  short tons compared to q mostly in white paper products the combination of this increased volume and a reduction in our delivered cost of  per short ton due to lower maintenance and chemical cost offset by seasonally higher energy expenses resulted in an increase ebtida of  million compared to the fourth quarter to  million i will now let joann discuss our financial performance before i conclude with our priorities and outlook joann longworth good morning everyone today we reported a net loss of  million for the first quarter or  per share excluding special items this compared to a net loss excluding special items of  million in the previous quarter and a net loss excluding special items of  million for the same period last year special items included startup costs of  million associated with the calhoun tissue project  million of closure cost for mokpo and  million in stores inventory write down associated with the closure total sales in the first quarter were  million  million below the fourth quarter overall pricing positively impacted our results by  million primarily in lumber where prices rose by  per thousand board feet while our market pulp pricing rose by  per metric ton our three other segments stock pricing declined of  per short ton in tissue primarily due to an increase in parent roll sales  per metric ton in newsprint and  per short ton in speciality papers shipments of wood products and speciality papers increased by  million board feet and  short tons respectively in tissue volumes rose by  short tons resulting from higher sales of parent rolls which represented  of our shipments in the quarter up from  in q more than offsetting these gains were reductions in pulp of  metric tons resulting in part from the annual outage at catawba and by  metric tons in newsprint mostly due to the capacity disclosure excluding foreign currency and volume impacts our costs of goods sold was essentially unchanged from q we saw a  million decrease in maintenance cost reflecting improved productivity and reduced repair a  million reduction in pension and other post retirement benefit expense mostly due to lower interest cost resulting from the decrease in discount rates at the end of  and a  million reduction in chemical cost which were mostly offset by a  million seasonal increase in energy pricing and consumption a  million rise in startup cost associated with the calhoun tissue project and a  million increase in log and recycled fiber cost market pulp all in delivered cost was down by  per metric ton largely because of lower maintenance expenses resulting in an increase in ebitda of  to  per metric ton our progress at atlas continued to yield results with increased shipments of short ton of parent roll and ebitda of  million for the quarter the increase in cost of  per short ton was due to favourable adjustments in depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter in wood products the delivered cost rose by  per thousand board feet due largely to higher log cost and production curtailments nevertheless higher prices pushed ebitda up  per thousand board feet to  newsprints delivered cost rose by  per metric ton to  this is mostly explained by lower production higher freight and energy cost which were partially offset by lower maintenance and fixed cost ebitda per metric ton fell from  to  in specialty papers the delivered cost fell by  per short ton mostly driven by lower maintenance and chemical costs partially offset by seasonally higher energy expense leading to an increased ebitda per short ton of  to  despite a reduction in realized prices we spend  million in capital expenditures in the quarter  million of which was dedicated to the calhoun tissue project we anticipate that the total cost of the project will be about  million nevertheless we will meet our overall  capex target of  million as previously disclosed during the quarter we used  million of cash in operations mostly due to an increase in inventories in our wood product segment when combined with our capital spending this resulted in additional net borrowings of  million from our revolving credit facility during the quarter our debt as on march  was  million with the cash position of  million and total availability under our credit facilities of  million liquidity at the end of the quarter remained solid at  million we made contributions to our pension and opeb plans totalling  million in the quarter which resulted in a  million reduction in the net pension and opeb liability on our balance sheet during the first quarter the company reached an agreement with the province of ontario with respect to capacity reduction contributions under that provinces special funding relief regulations we are no longer required to make any further contributions in respect of capacity reductions in ontario that occurred after april   consequently contributions to the affected pension plans will be lower by approximately  million in  and  million in  in addition estimated contributions to our québec pension plans from  to  are expected to be lower than previously disclosed by approximately  million including  million for this year based on the exchange rate in effect on march   our total pension contributions are expected to decline by approximately  million in  compared to  and a further  million between  and  slide  reflect these changes and provides greater clarity on the timing of our  contributions i will now turn it over to richard for concluding remark richard garneau so before we’ll discuss our market outlook i would like to report on our four priorities for this year but first we make progress business in our tissue business and we’re pleased with the startup of our tissue machine at calhoun starting equipment ph of this complexity can bring unexpected difficulties all employees have embraced the challenge in the product we currently manufacture meets our expectations at this point in the rampup in the case of atlas we’ve generated positive ebitda this quarter and have increased our focus to improve sales going forward we only made progress improving equipment reliability which translated into lower maintenance costs particularly in our market pulp segments our capital spending for  will be centered on maintenance of business and the completion of the calhoun tissue project we will meet our previously disclosed target of a  million for the year and finally as i pointed out that we are disappointed with the countervailing duties recently imposed on our softwood lumber exports we support the measures taken by the québec government who responded to industry and community needs we also applaud the principal statements made by canadian federal ministers freeland and carl who declared that the trade actions were unfair and unwarranted we look forward to continuing to work with interactive stakeholders to ensure that québec and ontario lumber industries are recognize as free subsidies and deserve unencumbered access to the us market our market outlook remains unchanged from last quarter in pulp we are confident that the favorable market we are experiencing will continue until at least mid year and possibly into the second half we also expect to see stronger price realizations in the coming two quarters as announce price – less price increases in excess of  per metric ton or realized net of discount in tissue our manufacturing focus will be to continue to ramp up production but the key to all success will be in our marketing and sales effort not that we can offer a full complement of our integrated tissue and powder products we believe that customer will be increasingly receptive to all offering we will continue to promote our green heritage and harmony brands and actively pursue bid cycle opportunities with us retailers in lumber we expect steady increases housing starts for the foreseeable future however we anticipate shortterm volatility in the market cause by the imposition of us trade barriers in our paper rates we expect the ongoing demand decline to continue at the similar pace both domestically and offshore where currencies will continue to handicap the competitiveness of all us mills we are committed to positioning our network to compete effectively this concludes our formal presentation operator we will now open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question is from hamir patel cibc capital markets please go ahead hamir patel sure i want to get your thoughts on how lumber prices in canada might see relative to the us when duties are in effect because i under during lumber four there was discount of the benchmark but curious what you think that may be in this current environment richard garneau well there was no doubt that we’re going to  unfortunately i see a discount in the canadian market so the tax the countervailing tax imposed on the export is going to force more volume in canada and more volume in canada means that were going probably to see the canadian market to be oversupply and we knew when there was more supply and demand the impact on pricing hamir patel great thanks it’s helpful i know québec has spoken about giving loan guarantees and i may have missed this if this is kind of reported in the french press what exactly is the québec government going to be doing to support the sawmilling industry richard garneau well the program has been while the premier has indicated his intention to help the communities and the industry so we were expecting that we’ll have to see the loans that could be offered volume indiscernible québec at market conditions depending its what i heard depending of the credit how strong your credit is so i think that to make sure that its not countervailable that is not going to taxable so québec has put us in this program basically some strong production to make sure that its going to be recognized as market so it means that they continue with this weaker credit is going to be more like it is now with commercial bank so the premier has been very supportive and i think that indiscernible i think the premier has this strong position to held the communities and they has assisted also on the fact that québec has an auction system that is market and has been strongly critical of the benchmark that has been use by commerce to determine the duty rates hamir patel thanks for that richard thats all i had i’ll turn it over richard garneau thank you operator operator instructions and we have a question from the line of paul quinn with rbc capital markets please go ahead paul quinn yes thanks very much and good morning richard richard garneau good morning paul quinn just had a couple questions one on softwood lumber i know you expect the rate to be zero but given the politics of the file what was your expectation on the preliminary cvd did it come in the range that you thought and your discount offs some of the western producers is that the amount that you guys were kind of expecting richard garneau well the – i was expecting sort of a lower rate than that i was expecting that the auction system in québec would be use and as you’re probably aware they use nova scotia as a benchmark benchmark that apparently cannot be verified and its confidential what i knew at this point looking at the details of how they came to the margin commerce came to the margin they didn’t basically use – there is variance of  million so they have under estimated our stumpage and really that caused by  million so our margin should be lower than that and also they had also countervail power so green power that is not at all use into the manufacture of the lumber so i think that i’m confident while assuming that there is no politics i’m confident that our rate is going to be significantly lower by one they come with the final determination paul quinn okay and then from the last time that we saw this final determination rates came down through litigation over time but it seemed to take at least two years do you expect the same timeline on litigation on the file to be able to ultimately reduce the final rate richard garneau well i think that we have obviously to wait for the final determination so i think that certainly we will have an opportunity to verification to have discussion with the commerce auditors so the discrepancies that i just referred to are going to be taken into account i can tell you that it’s going to reduce the rate i think that we certainly going to have discussion on a green power in quebec it’s not related to lumber at all so when you look at trade laws ph and the statutes and regulations so i think that it’s not defensible and i think that the other one is the benchmark so nova scotia wood or timber is completely different from québec and ontario and i think that we have vetted ph system auction system more than royalty ph it’s in fact ahead slightly over  of the wood in québec that is sold through auction or brought from private timber land owner so i think that we should certainly see the final determine the reduction and i think that i would like to mention that back in  i knew it’s a long time ago but the residual value system in the field was to determine that they are were no subsidies so i think its matter of – certainly a matter of discussion certain discussions that we’re going to have between now and the final determination and before we talk about litigation so i think we have wait and final determination is probably going to november so we’ll have to live with these uncertainties for some months paul quinn okay and then if i can just move on to pulp here we were kind of disappointed with your realization in the quarter wondering if theres anything unusual and then second part is you described china growth is i think you had it at  i’m just wondering how sustainable you think that is going forward joann longworth hi paul it’s joann on the pulp pricing in q the issue there is it bit complicated but you had prices rising in the fourth  sorry decreasing in the fourth quarter rising in the first quarter so if you average them out the comparison unfortunately this is not a strong as what actually occurred during the first quarter and secondly you’ve got lags on the pricing in certain of our contract of a month to two months so we are expecting that the several price announcements we made in the first quarter we’ll see the bulk of that in the second and third quarter richard garneau and paul when i look at december and march so we saw an increase of  and its lag so i think that in the second quarter we’re going to basically get benefit of the price increase net of the discount paul quinn okay and then just a reference to that china growth almost  and the global growth that you pointed out over  how sustainable do you think that is going forward i mean a number of analysts including myself expected pulp pricing to come down to get to the capacity additions coming forward and that thing that we got sort of  we werent quite aware of is the significant growth in china and other places do you think thats sustainable richard garneau well it’s a very difficult to forecast as you know we all thought that we would see a very slow growth in china in the first quarter and we were all surprised so certainly trying to forecast what they  how much they’re going to buy and consume forward is very difficult but what i could say i think that there is certainly now we’re going to enter into more downtime annual maintenance downtime certainly in north america and i think the other factor paul that you aware is that our large new pulp mill didn’t start as fast and we know how difficult it on to startup equipment and to get up to the design capacity and get the quality so i think that and well certainly when i look at it for the second quarter and maybe the third that we’re going to continue to see a strong number so i think that there is probably its a subconscious optimism here if i can see but i think the pulp market is certainly increasing paul quinn okay and just lastly turning to newsprint  you described the operating array at  for the industry what is that for resolute and weve also seen because of the sort of weakening price at wescare weve seen a price increase announcement from norpac and others and whats the pricing situation in the east coast richard garneau well it’s certainly under pressure with the demand decline and i think that now with the price increase announcement in the west so i was getting closer in terms of pricing between the east and west i think that this  so what’s reflect the machine closure a permanent closure that happened indiscernible with all in other companies also that their capacity out and converted that to other products so i think that normally at  and the reason that we put that in our script is that  you should see stable pricing and well in the past at  ph we the industry enjoyed price increase but i think that to the indiscernible down what we had in the past and i think that with the decline its continue to decline  per year so its only going to force the industry to supply and demand – to adjust the supply to a demand paul quinn excellent thanks richard and joann and look forward to improvement in q thank you richard garneau sure thank you joann longworth thank you operator and there are no further questions at this time i’ll turn the

compared to our  million in the third our results were supported by increase overall volumes lower chemicals and sga costs as well as favorable foreign exchange on the other hand reduction in pricing across all our business segments as well as higher costs related to fiber and energy negatively impacted our financial performance by segment we generated adjusted ebitda of  million in market pulp unchanged from the third quarter marginally positive ebitda from our tissue operation an improvement of  million  million in wood product compared to  million in the previous quarter  newsprint up by  million and  million in specialty papers up by  million we are pleased to report that we have made progress in addressing operational issues experience in prior quarters particularly in all tissue segments our targeted initiatives to improve reliability and efficiency are showing results including atlas the performance of continues digester at calhoun showed strong improvement in the quarter reflecting corrections to peripheral equipment our wood product segment delivered solid result even a seasonally higher cost impacted margin in paper market structural demand declines combined with weakening global currencies continued to present challenges in both newsprint and specialty paper segment nevertheless we lowered our costs from the third quarter and our ebitda improved significantly lets discuss our individual segments starting with market pulp world demand for chemical pulp grew by  in the quarter compared to the same period of  chinese demand rose by  while north america and western europe fell by  and  respectively world capacity grew by nearly  metric tons over the same period world demand for softwood was up by  in the quarter this mostly reflected the  increase in shipment to china north america and western europe demand fell by  and  respectively in the same technical difficulty demand for hardwood was up by  and shipment to china up by  while north america and western europe were down by  and  respectively our overall pricing for the pulp segment fell by  per metric ton as anticipated supply addition particularly in other wood grade maintain that pricing pressure through the fourth quarter our operating performance was improved compared to the third quarter previously discussed challenges with turf oil equipment and continuous digester at calhoun were largely resolved and output increase during the quarter supported by incremental production at calhoun and better operating efficiencies of saintfelicien and thunder bay shipments rose by  metric tons when compared to the third quarter certain global market dynamics evolve in the recent weeks capacity addition were delayed and stronger than anticipated chinese demand led to a tightening of market condition as a result that we announced price increases key pulp product in january and february of this year despite these positive developments we continue to believe that incremental supply expected in the coming quarters will lead to pricing pressure in the latter part of  and into next year but we continue to believe that longterm prospect for the pulp market favorable in this quarter total tissue consumption in the united states grew by  against the same period last year away from home shipments increased by  over the same period while at home volume by  our overall pricing declined by  per short ton this quarter due to change in our customer mix as well as declining prices for current rolls shipments declined by  short tons mostly away from home product on the other hand we made progress in the implementation of all action plan the resulting impact has been a reduction of  million in cost in the fourth quarter compared to the previous quarter this translated into a significant reduction in the average cost per short ton which fell by more than  when compared to the third quarter despite remaining challenges in revenue growth the segment generated slightly positive ebitda in q a  million improvement when compared to the previous quarter our target of  million to  million in annual ebitda in  is unchanged  will be a better year for our tissue segment we are looking forward to starting up our new tissue machine at calhoun and we believe that we are finally turning the corner with atlas we expect to close off the calhoun project spending around the originally budgeted amount of  million the converting lines are operating and we will now setting finished product with that purchase current pulp the housing market in the united states continue to strengthen during the fourth quarter while seasonally adjusted the housing starts in the us rose by  with singlefamily starts increasing by  on average when compared to the third quarter following seasonally weaker demand our overall pricing in the segment slipped  per thousand board feet during the quarter sustained productivity gains across our network as well as added production from our newly acquired sawmill in senneterre translated into shipments of  million board feet very closed the third quarter our overall cost was impacted negatively by higher fiber usage and operating cost made worse by winter condition in north overall the ebitda was  million for the quarter compared to  million in the third quarter while all of  wood product segment saw shipments in excess of  billion board feet of lumber the highest levels in  and generated ebitda of  million the lumber tree dispute between canada and the united states unfolded as we anticipated we have been selected as one of the mandatory respondents in both antidumping and conserving beauty investigation we continue to believe that the result of the department of commerce investigation could be favorable to resolute however if the department of commerce were to determine that unfair trade practices exist with respect to all export of lumber to the united states that determination could represent risk to the company overall liquidity north american demand for newsprint fell by  in  export declined by  metric tons compared to the same period last year as global demand went by  through november when compared to  even as north american demand continues its structural declining the industry operating rates remained at  in  our newsprint volume rose by  metric tons when compared to the third quarter these gains were almost entirely realized in north america and made possible by higher production become more internally pricing slipped by  per metric tons during the quarter the consequence of weakening global currencies due mostly to the higher volume mainly in domestic market our delivered cost fell by  per metric ton to  consequently the ebitda rose by  million when compared to the previous quarter reaching  million this year we expect continue decline in demand for newsprint particularly in export market where customers purchase technical difficulty remain a challenge in north america we believe that supply and demand will remain balanced as a result of one machine conversion out of newsprint in the first quarter north american demand for uncoated mechanical papers was down by  in  compared to the previous year markets for supercalendered papers led this decline dropping by  for the year while other uncoated fell by  industry production fell by  for the year in line with market demand this led to an operating rate that was unchanged from last year at  although decelerating in the last quarter the decline of north american demand for coated mechanical grades reach  in  after retreating in the first half of the year imports rose significantly in the latter part of  pushed by weaker global currencies compared to the us dollars and declining demand in western europe north american production declined by  for the year resulting in a shipment to capacity ratio of  given structural declines and lower seasonal demand our overall pricing for the specialty papers segment fell by  per short ton in the fourth quarter to  per short ton shipments also declined by  short tons on the other hand we have reduced our delivered cost by  to  per short ton mostly due to lower chemical costs resulting ebitda for the quarter was  million  million higher than the third quarter supply and demand in specialty papers will continue to be challenged by declines in market demand weakening global currencies will also encourage imports into the united states we had established four priority areas for  and our action in those areas have delivered important benefits in newsprint we successfully implemented price increases in our domestic market however economic conditions in the falling market and global currency weakness against the us dollars had a negative impact on pricing on our tissue initiatives our focus on improving the performance of atlas is starting to show result and we are only weeks away from starting up the new tissue machine at calhoun following correction to the peripheral equipment the pulp mill at calhoun delivered its strongest operating performance  in the fourth quarter and is on track to reach its full potential in  finally the combined value generated by our atikokan and ignace sawmill has increased as production sales and ebitda all significantly improved in  following a challenging year in  we are entering  with cautious optimism our top right priorities for this year will be first we will successfully ramp up our calhoun tissue operation and together with atlas develop a solid customer base through quality of our product offering second we will focus even more on improving operating performance and lowering cost third we will lower our capital expenditure by opportunities to reduce net debt with the goal of decreasing our leverage and finally we will continue to deploy every effort to mitigate definitive trade actions on export of lumber to the us and that should duty deposit we put in place our financial flexibility as i mentioned would be affected joann will now review our financial performance joann longworth good morning today we reported a net loss of  million for the fourth quarter or  per share excluding special items this compared to net income excluding special items of  million in the previous quarter and a net loss excluding special items of  million for the same period last year special items included  million of closure cost impairment and other related charges of which  million related to recycled newsprint assets  million of foreign currency translation loss nonoperating pension and other postemployment benefit cost of  million and start up cost of  million associated with calhoun tissue operation total sales in the third quarter were  million essentially unchanged compared to the third quarter pricing for our products declined in all of our segments pulp fell by  per metric ton tissue by  per short ton wood product by  per thousand board feet newsprint by  per metric ton and specialty papers by  per short ton the other hand volumes increased overall when compared to the third quarter this rise was primarily driven by our pulp segment where shipments increased by  metric tons and in newsprint where shipments rose by  metric volumes volumes in wood products remain strong at  million board feet specialty paper volume however fell by  short tons owing primarily to seasonality and unfavorable market conditions as for tissue shipments declined by  short tons excluding foreign currency and volume impact our costs of goods sold increased by  million for the quarter compared to q the key changes were as follows a  million increase in recycled fiber prices and wood cost a  million increase in purchased energy resulting from higher seasonal steam consumption and rising natural gas prices and  million increase in maintenance costs which were partially offset by a  million reduction in chemical costs originating mostly from normal operations of our line count and a change in great disc ph market pulp allin delivered cost was down by  per metric ton largely from the higher volume as well as lower chemical cost which was partially offset by rising prices of recycled fiber these improvements were not sufficient to offset pricing decline and as a result ebitda fell by  to  per metric ton following a positive adjustment the amortization expense of  million and progress on our action plan cost in our tissue segment improved in the fourth quarter ebitda rose by  million and was marginally positive for the quarter in wood products the delivered cost rose by  per thousand board feet do largely higher fiber usage and operating cost exacerbated by winter conditions as a result ebitda was  per thousand board feet versus  in q newsprint delivered cost also fell this quarter by  to  per metric ton this was mostly explained by higher volumes ebitda per metric ton rose by  to  in the quarter in specialty papers the delivered cost fell to  per short ton mostly driven by lower chemical costs ebitda per short ton rose from  to  during the quarter we generated  million of cash from operations and increased our net borrowing by  million in order to support our capital expenditures fourth quarter capex was  million  million of which was dedicated to the calhoun issue project we expect the total project cost to be to about  million approximately  million will be required to complete the project in  the majority of which will be spent in the first quarter total capital expenditures for  were  million with the additional  million drawn on our revolver  revolving credit facility during the fourth quarter our net borrowing in  were  million and resulted in total debt of  million as of december  our cash position was  million at the end of the year which combined with the availability under our revolving credit facility resulted in liquidity of  million the net pension and opeb liability on our balance sheet increased by  million since the end of the third quarter reaching  billion at yearend this is mostly explained by a reduction in the applicable discount rate partially offset by regular contributions in december following our negotiations with ontario and an amendment to a special funding relief regulation the company voluntarily exited québec funding relief regulation as such beginning on january   the companys québec pension plan will be subject to the provinces supplemental pension plans act which provides for funding pension deficit on a going concern basis rather than on the solvency basis this new legislation is expected to lessen the impact of shortterm market fluctuations and reduce the amount of annual pension contributions when compared to the baseline contributions of  we estimate that pension contributions will drop by approximately  million between  and  while ontario funding calculations remain solvency based the required contributions for our us plan are computed using a year average interest rate and as mentioned previously québec uses a going concern basis given these parameters our funding deficit including a stabilization provision required under the québec legislation is lower than our accounting deficit by approximately  million alain bourdages this includes our former presentation operator we will now open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of roger stitz with bank of america your line is open roger stitz thank you good morning can you speak with  about the tempo of the calhoun rampup in terms of the volumes and ebitda as you go through the quarters of  richard garneau i think that what i  technical difficulty roger stitz im sorry can you speak  i beg your pardon very much could you please speak a little closer to the mic i can barely hear you richard garneau so well as we already announced were going to start the machine in the next few weeks we already are in the process of commissioning and that thing so  and the three converting lines are in operation we said that we are considering the product with purchased roles so i think that before we see the rampup of this machine i think that is probably too early to mention any target or demand ebitda so i think that the expectation what we previously indicated in term of profitability was to believe that it’s a target that is achievable so next quarter were going to be in a production to report on the startup itself and the rampup and to better determine the machine productivity and product acceptance into the market roger stitz and can you discuss your marketing strategy for  with the converted tissue do you expect to  have you presold some is it to strategic customers is it to tissue distributors anything you care to tell us about that richard garneau well we already have some firm volume from large retailers and we continue to reaching out to large retailers but we dont have again the product that were going to have with our machine is put into production so i think that some of the important one are waiting to see the final quality of the product but even  what is very encouraging even with the parental ph  purchase control that we converted on our tree line so there is a large retailers that as i started to pass on their shelf the product and the reaction has been very positive so i think that the  at the end of the first quarter when we have product were going to  because its a premium quality that were going to have on that tissues and towels so i think that by then were going to be able to give you  to give the investors and show a better indication of the traction of the  well the acceptance and the progress also on longer term commitment with the retailers roger stitz thank you can for you provide capex for  and  richard garneau well im just going to give you a range on capex on the  i think that the  we should normally go back to the level that we had in  that  and if you look at our financial statement it was around the  million so i would give you a range of between  million to  million is the expectation on capex in  i dont have a number yet for  but if you look at our capex this year were  million so if we go back to the    level its  million  million reduction is what we expect for next year roger stitz so the  million to  million includes the  million for the calhoun thats mostly in q is that correct richard garneau yes it includes the completion of calhoun roger stitz thank you very much richard garneau youre welcome operator and your next question comes from the line of paul quinn with rbc capital markets your line is open paul quinn yeah thanks very much and good morning richard garneau good morning joann longworth good morning paul paul quinn just a couple of questions just i agree with you in a short term run on pulp looks like you  you are going to see some higher prices just wondering how bad you think the back half of  and into  is going to be with the significant capacity increases on both the softwood and hardwood side richard garneau you know paul i think that when you look at the demand in china we were surprised to see the increase in demand of  we just dont know when our salespeople don’t know if it is sustainable but it seems that we are consuming a lot more pulp so i think that if this trend continues i believe that  well certainly continue to have pressure on price because the capacity addition is significant but that could be tampered and somewhat by this significant demand increase in china with the softwood and hardwood paul quinn okay fair enough just on the tissue side we saw december operating rates down to  we have got some capacity adds again in this segment in   i know you got a new machine but do you expect some significant headwinds there well richard garneau well i think the positive on the tissue is that the demand is growing so it’s true there was capacity addition but i think that when i look at review report there is room for at least machine or even twoyear so  and i think that it is what has been announced so i think that still very positive on the side and i think when you look at also at the  because we are always relate to the housing start and what you have you have that more household formation so going also to consume probably more tissue and wood also i think that we have to figure that also went to into demand and we are certainly assuming that the us economy is going to continue to grow so if the numbers that between  and  is certainly going to help tremendously on the tissue consumption or tissue demand paul quinn i like your performance metric slide  here is tissue something you are going to add to this once you get calhoun ramped up richard garneau sure we are just looking… joann longworth yes richard garneau yeah paul quinn okay last question i had for you just seeing  just in newsprint just because its been so bad for so long i think at some point maybe is five seven years ago we thought you know it might hit a base level and stop producing but  especially in north america was another significant down year do you see a base level that this is going to bottom i would add or is that still off in the distance richard garneau its very difficult question what we have been expecting this low level seven years and we still dont see it so i would  i think if i would refrain to make any forecast of this one but at some point we certainly expect that we are going to see a flow but we just dont know when its going to happen the other part also is really when we would look at export the currency weaknesses in the market where we sell all products the brazil or mexico or asia so i think that had a very significant impact so when we talk with our customers they are paying in us dollars and in some case with the currency that has depreciated by  that  there was consequence to that so thats probably generating or pushing the decline faster than it should have and if there is adjustment in currency maybe there is some adjustment that we may see on the demand side paul quinn all right thanks very much best of luck richard garneau thank you operator your next question comes from the line of kasia trzaski with td securities your line is open kasia trzaski hi good morning everyone this is kasia filling for sean just a few questions morning your average pulp transaction prices fell  per metric ton quarteroverquarter and that now case decline in indiscernible prices that we track can you speak maybe the mix on your pulp shipments that may have helped the filling the gap richard garneau i am just trying to get to the mix i think we have sold more  so when i look at the volume here on sales price compared to the previous quarter i think that hardwood that went down the mills and we had higher shipments on hardwood so i think overall its mix driven here the hardwood has brought the pricing on softwood we also experienced a decline in pricing but it was significantly less but overall we had a slight improvement on fluff and our rbt went up just slightly so it’s really the mix on hardwood and the significant decline in hardwood with the new capacity announcement that  the impact that we had in the fourth quarter kasia trzaski okay thats helpful and just coming back to what you said a second ago i did notice in the press release that you had referenced gains in fluff pulp prices were the benchmark that we track indicated very modest sequential pressure can you help me understand the discrepancy there richard garneau well the pricing announcement on fluff is  in february so i think that  there is  the demand is a bit better so  but i think that albeit the product we have seen an announcement on northern bleached of twine engine ph  in february so i think that it’s in line with  also what has been announced on the southern bleached softwood also  i think the fluff only  one announcement in february of  so i think that we feel it’s on slot this price increase is more or likely than not be fully implemented kasia trzaski got it it sounds like you guys didn’t see that pressure in q than  for you guys okay and going to your wood products cost quarteroverquarter spike was a bit sharper than normal and outside of the seasonal factors that you referenced was there other elements affecting this or was it more of a return just to normalized cost level after exceptional q results richard garneau i think that we had the quite a difficult quarter weatherwise we had lot of snow and impact on the wood delivery that had also on our cost so it’s weather related than anything else and i think that so far in the first quarter i think that we are seeing more a more normal condition but the snow we have obviously have been used the productivity on the machine and it was also cold in the fourth quarter compared to the third then there is always an impact on the wood yield so when it’s frozen solid and when you depart just to you an idea what is going on to the sawmill there was fiber losses that has been basically reflected in our fourth quarter result the other impact also even though we ship at almost a record level during the holidays the christmas and new year we also had  well already our reach that has also impacted our overall cost the fixed cost then i have the volume so when you think that  this three items into account explained what happened and we should normally have more expect  we will more normal condition then in the first quarter and going forward kasia trzaski okay thats helpful thank you and then last one here looks like prices for coated ground wood improved in early  but the uncoated grades hold back do you expect any more traction and implementation of default coated ground wood prices or any other color you can provide on current market conditions would be great richard garneau well when we look at the operating rate its at  level so normally at this level we can expect stability in pricing i think that i would not  i would  certainly when you look at coated there is more import coming to us with the currency and its also true for supercalendered paper so  and i think that certainly that headwind that we have on very strong us dollars is making well its more difficult to deal with a market that is declining and that there is more offering coming from overseas and the imports if you look at the stats or coming in  really going up and wood probably continue to come to the us with the currency if us dollars continue to strengthen so lately we have seen some pull back on the us dollar so could  so the overall work trade somewhat but i think it is difficult to predict what is going to happen on this side kasia trzaski got it okay thats it for me thank you very much operator and your next question comes from the line of indiscernible your line is open unidentified analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question the first one is regarding the trade dispute you guys have noted a few times now that you expected it to sort of in a positive manner which would certainly help you guys there could be some liquidity risk some other ways could you maybe help us quantify that or helps to understand what that liquidity risk is and are you guys currently accruing for any potential trade tariff issues onto the balance sheet right now thats my first question richard garneau are you referring to the cvde on supercalendered and lumber unidentified analyst yeah exactly the soa exactly with… richard garneau okay well we have been selected as the respondent for québec and ontario and we are in the process to respond to all the questions that has been raised by commerce you probably not aware of it but the québec government has been really really pushing hard to have their new  well it’s not new anymore lets say  forestry regime that the is that is that a copy of the us forest service and many of the states that sell wood on the market so  of the wood is sold through options and i think that the options are basically the basis for sitting the stumpage sales for all the volume into the province so  and i think that the québec government want to a great extend they have everything in the  someone from the university of pennsylvania to look and he is an expert in options to look at our system and this report is going to be share with commerce and we are certainly opening and the québec system is going to be recognized as market obviously the other part we also have operation in ontario the company that is going to report on it but in  ontario has been the only province that benefited from chapter  nafta chapter  decision a panel decision their forestry regime was market so i think it is always difficult to predict what the commerce is going to look at so weve had the  a tough experience with supercalendered paper with  this available and the items that they picked that were nor related at all to the product but i think that we have to wait and again we are confident that we are going to be able to make a demonstration with both government in ontario and québec that both provinces have a forestry regime and that is how they have stumpage the trees at market like to the space and usd in the united states unidentified analyst right i understand the process i was just more wondering from  you mentioned it could be negative liquidity event should go against you first and what that negative liquidity can look like should it go against you guys richard garneau but i just dont know what thats going to be so it is going to be only to be  or  so when we have an indication of the preliminary rate thats probably unlikely to come before may and i know that the preliminary determination has been post on for few days so i think that  when we have that we are going to be able to quantify we heard all kind of numbers but you heard nice explanation on the system in québec and ontario so i am certainly not going to expect  not even  so i think it is going to  it may be a lot less than that and i just don’t know what the impact is that we are going to have so were going to wait until we have the determination and was going to share on the impact on our liquidity but some time you always expect well planned  expect for the better plan for the worse but we have not this point yet unidentified analyst got it i understand it is still to be trade that  thanks for that i guess my next question is really on the capex side it sound like you guys are still spending  million on calhoun this year does that  with that spend will you still be at your  because the numbers i have thatll be above the  and then what that imply for the rest of the business because i thought capex for this year will be lower than sort of the  to  range you are targeting and i guess the next implication for that is its a heavy q q spend so should we assume additional drawdowns on the revolver to help from the liquidity given some challenges operationally in the first half as well joann longworth hi jeff this is joann in terms of the spending for calhoun tissue i will let richard answer the rest of the question we spent  million in the year for  okay  million prior to that and we have  million left to go so by my math that adds to  million unidentified analyst got it okay richard garneau okay and to complete it the number that i mentioned between  and  i think that includes also the completion of the tissue project at calhoun and the normal capex that we have to make  to maintain our operation and we also have in this amount the project that have a quick payback so very good return but i think that we are going to return to the same level about the same level than  including the completion of calhoun unidentified analyst got it okay and then i guess the second part of that question was it sound like it’s going to heavy spend especially from calhoun first half second half and implications for liquidity because it sounds like you need to stop on that given your current cash balance and sort of the challenge operation in first half in terms of ebitda or whatnot so should to expect additional draws joann longworth yeah have your capex first half of the year yes i would assume we would draw more and then hopefully reverse that out towards the end of the year unidentified analyst got it and you said you spend  million of capex in calhoun in  so that imply the rest the business was sort of running at  million that seems higher than your normal run rate of ish or whatever for the business outside of tissue or was that spent on and where should we see that in terms of improved productivity in the operations because i guess i am having hard time seeing pickups in volume and whatnot so for me that on the cost side joann longworth well i think the next largest project that we have besides calhoun tissue is putting in a centralized and uniform sap system across the board so thats where a lot of the other savings coming from unidentified analyst is that done commercially or we have more to go on… joann longworth it will continue through  for the project so far and the rollout and then we will take a look from there on in but the biggest spend  one of the biggest spend was in  as we wrapped up most of our payroll implementation richard garneau as we also announced previously we will be replacing two waterwheels at hydropower facility and we are going to have the cost in  so it’s already announced unidentified analyst do you quantify that sap cost richard garneau it’s about  million that within that and thats what we are going to spend on this two waterwheels unidentified analyst got it okay and then i guess lastly back on tissue segment i mean it sounds like you are making a little bit of progress on the atlas side but i guess its  just trying to understand how are you going to get to  ebitda target there and i know you are not giving specific guidance on calhoun yet but how is the mix of that business in terms of price and product and cost as well relative to your atlas business is it a lower price point or higher and should the ebitda generation at calhoun at full rate is that supposed to be higher than atlas or how should we think about that richard garneau well defiantly so i think that when calhoun is ramp up its capacity is going to be more profitable than atlas dont forget that it’s dry creek its away from home we have also some at home product but calhoun is premium product and premium product sales for more than the away from home and it is going to be virgin the miami machines we have two machines or recycle so i think that again recycle sells more or less you don’t have this employee and we supply all the pulp from our fairmont mill that has  recycle mill has a very good quality but the advantage is definitely going to be at calhoun with this facility that we have only three lines just to give you an example three converting lines at calhoun for  tons of production and we have  in florida so you can just so well portrayed from the labor point of view at significantly less on calhoun so you have nature of difference here the other item also that you have to take into account calhoun is flesh pulp that is going to be count directly to the machine so there is no permission ph cost and i think it got advantage it’s the integration that we are going to have so there is also  when you look even further than that the steam cost well so you have the facilities you have the models that oil running for the other products all capacity so all this is going to be to benefit to the issue in calhoun and thats the rational that we view reset to build machine into an existing mill to take advantage of the synergies and benefit that we can get compared to nonintegrated tissue facility unidentified analyst goy it when do you think this is going to be running at capacity richard garneau well let’s… unidentified analyst to be determined and sort of still… richard garneau yeah to be determined… joann longworth thats a good response unidentified analyst what is the  i guess what is inability to figure out when it can be ramped up or is it  because you put the capex in place and this still a long lead time in terms of machinery to ramp up or i mean is it like a year or is it a year and half two years what is it because its been a big spend for the last three years now so richard garneau the experience is that it takes normally a year but the  again what i want to emphasize here the three converting lines are running basically they has been commissioned and we had that done all the test so now its going to be focused on the machines and with the assistance of the manufacturers we have  has been  we have spend a lot of time with the employees on training so they had visited here and they have worked alongside people that are operating the machines is exactly the same so it’s a start up and start up it’s not like a new car you put the key and then started you have  those many components and you have to basically do everything in the process to make it happen but again at the end of the first quarter we are going to have the indication and how we are going to be able to run this mission now with the information that we are going to gain by the end of this month we should start really do to see some product on the machine but at the end of march we should have a better idea and be able to better answer the question that you have on this unidentified analyst got it and then the last one for me and i will let someone else to hope in and i know i have taken some of your time you guys seen  guys came in to the tissue space because i mean some of you guys  some of your competitors are obviously looking for is a growth and one being tissue relative to things like newsprint and coated and whatnot because we sort of look at and see to it seems they are also targeting tissue i mean what do you think about sort of the initial capacity is coming into the industry and what that means for competition and pricing and then maybe growth as well because just seem like there is other guys coming into space so richard garneau i think that when you look at newsprint its mechanical pulp base and you cannot make tissue with mechanical pulp you need kraft mill to be able to supply pulp to the machine so i think that you have well many newsprint manufacturers if you don’t have a pulp mill on site i think that well you are going to be insulated and youre going to buy your pulp on the market the authorize pulp on the market when you look at calhoun it’s one significant maybe that we have we had all necessary we had invested in new digester this is now running fairly well so  and when you look at the  there is a few project just not integrated so we don’t have the benefit that we are going to have calhoun and the location i also would like to stress the location if you look at calhoun in tennessee and you look at technical difficulty we can read to a significant number of household and normally it is in disarray that you have you have more housing starts and more household formation so we should also benefit from it unidentified analyst got it thank you guys i will let someone else to get on thank you richard garneau thank you operator your next question comes from the line of hamir patel with cibc capital markets your line is open hamir patel hi good morning i just have one question for joann the customer reports in december that québec was thinking of offering loan guarantees to the lumber industry in the province when duties hit just curious how we should think about how that might impact resolutes liquidity and are you expecting any sort of similar assistance from the federal government as well richard garneau well i am going to take this one so i think that the province because you know that in québec there was many small independent companies and sawmills so  and premier as indicated that the is going to stand by sort of government does not do i think that the  well at least its a source  so its a guarantee that they are going  the government is going for likely because we don’t have any detail the premier has announced it but without really stating what the intend is  the intend that they have on the structure itself but i think it’s just guarantee and the sawmills operator in the province will be able to go to their bank going from the government and be able to finance the deposit if we have the  if we all  or the primary determination basically said rate for the province hamir patel great okay thanks thats all i have richard garneau operator we will have time for one last question operator certainly the last question comes from the line of kevin cohen with imperial capital your line is open kevin cohen good morning and thanks for taking the question i guess when you look at liquidity in the pacing during the year there sort of a minimum liquidity target that company seek to maintain and in that context for the company explore potentially issuing equity or other equity like options to improve the liquidity joann longworth we dont have a specific liquidity target obviously the year coming has a lot in front of it in terms of completing the tissue project and wrapping that up in term of whether we pay any duty cvde antidumping or otherwise we also have a large amount on deposit for our and sc calendered or calendered paper which we are continuing to battle a broad spectrum of we’re up against in  our goal as we discussed and our priority is to continue to reduce capex and be disciplined in our capex spend look at other opportunities to reduce net debt so that were able to keep our leverage where it is or lower so thats one of our objectives for the year kevin cohen sure and has the company articulated any sort of margin goals as it relates to that capex in terms of thinking about the incremental ebitda on a run rate basis starting to flow through in the coming kind of  to  months out joann longworth this is on the tissue project kevin cohen yes joann longworth no we have not announced yet what the return is or what our ebitda expectations are as richard said we will have a better idea in terms of the rampup once we see the machine running by the end of this quarter and are able to show that product to customers to see how quickly it can be incorporated into the market kevin cohen and then one last real quick question any easy to sell assets anything sort of noncore when you look across the portfolio that would be easy source of liquidity if need be just as a plan b richard garneau well not at this point so i think that with certainly sawmills and the pulp mill it is part of our core and tissue and on the paper side we have integrated with the sawmills in québec and ontario and obviously that many buyers that interested in uncoated paper or newsprint these days kevin cohen thats very helpful thanks and best of luck richard garneau thank you operator and there are no further questions in queue richard garneau so that concludes our call operator thank you everybody operator this
