consider the risks described below and the other information in this prospectus before investing in our common stock if any of the following risks occur our business operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed the trading price of our common stock when and if we trade at a later date could decline due to any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment risks related to our business because our auditors have raised a going concern there is a substantial uncertainty that we will continue operations in which case you could lose your investment our auditors have issued a going concern opinion this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business as such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your investment we may continue to lose money and if we do not achieve profitability we may not be able to continue our business we are company with limited operations have incurred expenses and have losses in addition we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses as a result we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability which may not occur we expect our operating expenses to increase as a result of our planned expansion even if we do achieve profitability we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future we expect to have quartertoquarter fluctuations in revenues expenses losses and cash flow some of which could be significant results of operations will depend upon numerous factors some beyond our control including regulatory actions market acceptance of our products and services new products and service introductions and competition   we are solely dependent upon the funds to be raised in this offering to start our business the proceeds of which may be insufficient to achieve revenues and profitable operations we may need to obtain additional financing which may not be available   our current operating funds are less than necessary to complete our intended operations we need the proceeds from this offering to start our operations as described in the plan of operation section of this prospectus as of january   we had cash in the amount of  and liabilities of  as of this date we have no income and just recently started our operation the proceeds of this offering may not be sufficient for us to achieve revenues and profitable operations we need additional funds to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues there is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available on terms that will be acceptable to us we require minimum funding of approximately  to conduct our proposed operations for a period of one year if we are not able to raise this amount or if we experience a shortage of funds prior to funding we may utilize funds from shuisheng zhu our president treasurer and director who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and operation expenses however mr zhu has no formal commitment arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company after one year we may need additional financing if we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of  of additional funding to pay for ongoing sec filing requirements we do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing   if we are successful in raising the funds from this offering we plan to commence activities to continue our operations we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to continue our business plan according to our plan of operations we are a development stage company and have commenced limited operations in our business we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future   we were incorporated on october   and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities we have commenced limited business operations accordingly we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises the likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to undertake these potential problems include but are not limited to unanticipated problems relating to the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues we expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future we recognize that if the effectiveness of our business plan is not forthcoming we will not be able to continue business operations there is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks our business will most likely fail we have limited sales and marketing experience which increases the risk that our business will fail   we have no experience in the marketing of electronic toys distribution and have only nominal sales and marketing experience our future success will depend among other factors upon whether our services can be sold at a profitable price and the extent to which consumers acquire adopt and continue to use them there can be no assurance that our business will gain wide acceptance in its targeted markets or that we will be able to effectively market our services   we are in a competitive market which could impact our ability to gain market share which could harm our financial performance   the business of niche of electronic toys distribution is very competitive barriers to entry are relatively low and we face competitive pressures from companies anxious to join this niche there are a number of successful entities operated by proven companies that offer similar niche services which may prevent us from gaining enough market share to become successful  these competitors have existing customers that may form a large part of our targeted client base and such clients may be hesitant to switch over from already established competitors to our service  if we cannot gain enough market share our business and our financial performance will be adversely affected some of our competitors may be able to use their financial strength to dominate the market which may affect our ability to generate revenues some of our competitors may be much larger companies than us and very well capitalized they could choose to use their greater resources to finance their continued participation and penetration of this market which may impede our ability to generate sufficient revenue to cover our costs their better financial resources could allow them to significantly out spend us on research and development as well as marketing and production we might not be able to maintain our ability to compete in this circumstance we cannot guarantee future customers even if we obtain customers there is no assurance that we will be able to generate a profit if that occurs we will have to cease operations we have not identified any customers and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract future customers even if we obtain new customers for our service there is no guarantee that we will make a profit if we are unable to attract enough customers to operate profitably we will have to suspend or cease operations because we are small and do not have much capital our marketing campaign may not be enough to attract sufficient number of customers to operate profitably if we do not make a profit we will suspend or cease operations due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital we must limit our marketing activities and may not be able to make our services known to potential customers because we will be limiting our marketing activities we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably if we cannot operate profitably we may have to suspend or cease operations because our president treasurer and director will own more than  of our outstanding common stock he will make and control corporate decisions that may be disadvantageous to minority shareholders mr zhu our president treasurer and director will own more than  of the outstanding shares of our common stock accordingly he will have significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters including the election of directors mergers consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control the interests of mr zhu may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and may result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders we depend to a significant extent on certain key person the loss of whom may materially and adversely affect our company currently we have only two employee our president treasurer director mr shuisheng zhu and mr aleksandr deshin our secretary we depend entirely on shuisheng zhu our president treasurer director for all of our operations the loss of mr zhu would have a substantial negative effect on our company and may cause our business to fail mr zhu has not been compensated for his services since our incorporation and it is highly unlikely that he will receive any compensation unless and until we generate substantial revenues there is intense competition for skilled personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms the loss of mr zhus services could prevent us from completing the development of our plan of operation and our business in the event of the loss of services of such personnel no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the services of adequate replacement personnel we do not have any employment agreements or maintain key person life insurance policies on our officer and director we do not anticipate entering into employment agreements with him or acquiring key man insurance in the foreseeable future   because our president treasurer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations our operations may be sporadic which may result in periodic interruptions or suspensions of operations this activity could prevent us from attracting enough customers and result in a lack of revenues which may cause us to cease operations shuisheng zhu our president treasurer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations he will be devoting approximately  hours a week to our operations because our sole office and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to him as a result operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a possible cessation of operations our president treasurer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure control and procedures and internal control over financial reporting we have never operated as a public company shuisheng zhu our president treasurer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as a result we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company even if our operations are successful we plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations which are required for a public company that is reporting company with the securities and exchange commission however if we cannot operate successfully as a public company your investment may be materially adversely affected we are an emerging growth company under the jobs act and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors we qualify as an emerging growth company under the jobs act as a result we are permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements for so long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to  have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act  provide an auditor attestation with respect to managements report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting  comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements ie an auditor discussion and analysis  submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes such as sayonpay and sayonfrequency and  disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executives compensation to median employee compensation   in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards we will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is  billion ii the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by nonaffiliates is  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three year period until such time however we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile   risks associated with this offering because the offering price has been arbitrarily set by the company you may not realize a return on your investment upon resale of your shares   the offering price and other terms and conditions relative to the companys shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets earnings book value or any other objective financial criteria additionally as the company was formed on october   and has only a limited operating history with no earnings the price of the offered shares is not based on its past earnings and no investment banker appraiser or other independent third party has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares as such our stockholders may not be able to receive a return on their investment when they sell their shares of common stock we are selling this offering without an underwriter and may be unable to sell any shares   this offering is selfunderwritten that is we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares we intend to sell our shares through our president who will receive no commissions there is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares unless he is successful in receiving the proceeds in the amount of  from this offering we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our business plan the regulation of penny stocks by the sec and finra may discourage the tradability of the companys securities   the shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the securities and exchange act of  as amended the exchange act and rules of the commission the exchange act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on brokerdealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are generally institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding   jointly with spouse or in transactions not recommended by the brokerdealer for transactions covered by the penny stock rules a broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations the compensation to be received by the brokerdealer and certain associated persons and deliver certain disclosures required by the commission consequently the penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase if at all our president mr zhu does not have any prior experience offering and selling securities  and our offering does not require a mimimum amount to be raised as a result of this we may not be able to raise enough funds to commence and sustain our business and investors may lose their entire investment mr zhu does not have any experience conducting a securities offering consequently we may not be able to raise any funds successfully also the best effort offering does not require a minimum amount to be raised if we are not able to raise sufficient funds we may not be able to fund our operations as planned and our business will suffer and your investment may be materially adversely affected our inability to successfully conduct a besteffort offering could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us due to the lack of a trading market for our securities you may have difficulty selling any shares you purchase in this offering we are not registered on any market or public stock exchange there is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus we plan to contact a market maker immediately following the completion of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the overthecounter bulletin board otcbb the otcbb is a regulated quotation service that displays realtime quotes last sale prices and volume information in overthecounter securities the otcbb is not an issuer listing service market or exchange although the otcbb does not have any listing requirements to be eligible for quotation on the otcbb issuers must remain current in their filings with the sec or applicable regulatory authority if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the otc bulletin board market makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement securities already quoted on the otcbb that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a  to  day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time we cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale as of the date of this filing there have been no discussions or understandings between rizzen inc and anyone acting on our behalf with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities if no market is ever developed for our common stock it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering in such a case you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay if at all in addition if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult if not impossible to ever resell your shares resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment   we will incur ongoing costs and expenses for sec reporting and compliance without revenue we may not be able to remain in compliance making it difficult for investors to sell their shares if at all   the estimated cost of this registration statement is  which will be paid from offering proceeds if the offering proceeds are less than registration cost we will have to utilize funds from shuisheng zhu our president treasurer and director who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process mr zhus verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non binding and discretionary after the effective date of this prospectus we will be required to file annual quarterly and current reports or other information with the sec as provided by the securities exchange act we will voluntarily continue reporting in the absence of an sec reporting obligation we plan to contact a market maker immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the otc electronic bulletin board to be eligible for quotation issuers must remain current in their filings with the sec in order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources the costs associated with being a publicly traded company in the next  month will be approximately  if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase if at all also if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the otc bulletin board the companys investors may suffer future dilution due to issuances of shares for various considerations in the future our articles of incorporation

shares issued and outstanding as discussed in the dilution section below the issuance of the shares of common stock described in this prospectus will result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our existing shareholders the issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock forward looking statements   this prospectus contains forwardlooking statements that involve risk and uncertainties we use words such as anticipate believe plan expect future intend and similar expressions to identify such forwardlooking statements investors should be aware that

arbitrarily by us the price does not bear any relationship to our assets book value earnings or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company in determining the number of shares to

considered an indication of the actual value of the securities dilution   dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and from total assets dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholder the historical net tangible book value as of january   was  or approximately  per share historical net tangible book value per share of common stock is equal to our total tangible assets less total

in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of

last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three year period   our cash balance was  as of january   we believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our operations for any period of time we have been utilizing and may utilize funds from shuisheng zhu our chairman and president who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs filing fees and professional fees as of january   mr zhu has advanced to us  mr zhu however has no formal commitment arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company in order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve month period we require a minimum of  of

activities described in the plan of operation section below long term financing beyond the maximum aggregate amount of this offering may be required to expand our business the exact amount of funding will depend on the scale of our development and expansion we do not currently have planned our expansion and we have not decided yet on the scale of our development and expansion and on exact amount of funding needed for our long term financing if we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of  of additional funding at the end of the twelve month period described in our plan of operation below to maintain a reporting status   our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills this is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development there is no assurance we will ever reach that stage to meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering if we are unable to successfully find customers we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to find alternative sources at the present time we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash other than through this offering if we need additional cash and cannot raise it we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely even if we raise  from this offering we may need more funds for ongoing business operations after the first year and would have to obtain additional funding plan of operation we were incorporated in the state of nevada on october   we have never declared bankruptcy have never been in receivership and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings since incorporation we have not made any significant

of operations is as follows complete our public offering we expect to complete our public offering within  days after the effectiveness of our registration statement by the securities and exchange commissions we intend to concentrate our efforts on raising capital during this period our operations will be limited due to the limited amount of funds on hand upon completion of our public offering our specific goal is to profitably sell our services if we are unable to obtain minimum funding of approximately  if  of the shares sold our business may fail our plan of operations following the completion is as follows gathering of market information  months no costs we are going to search for electronic kids toys plants around of china we plan to study plants assortment and estimate quality and price range of electronic kids toys we plan to find the optimal manufactures and negotiate agreements with them office and warehouse std months  to successfully perform basic services it is estimated that our company would demand a pc to be connected to the internet in order to exchange uptodate information with toys manufacturers and their stock databases concerning the goods laptops for the sales managers and a server to store our customers database and the information related to it would be another state of expenditure the company would need an office customers and manufacturers might wish to contact to if any information regarding services needed we also plan to lease the small about  sqft warehouse with prepared shelves to store the electronic toys for distribution provided that only  of shares are sold the office might be equipped with simple and basic furniture basic stationery via phone a fax a printer and two computers powerful enough to perform everyday operations taking orders online for instance provided that if  of shares are sold the company could consider buying better equipment in case if  shares are sold the company would consider renting an office big enough for the staff buying all furniture needed more powerful computers able to perform everyday operations as well as website maintenance directly from the office   website stth months  once the company incorporated it is likely to need a website where all the goods are planned to be displayed in case if  shares sold we would order a website of a simple design with the functions of a webstore in case of more than  shares sold we are likely to order a website designed according current trends with embedded animation to advertise the goods in case if  of shares sold we are likely employ a multifunctional website with functions of a webstore embedded animation and embedded video advertisements to promote either particular goods or particular vendors with the builtin functions to order a call from the support centre the website that would monitor the customers activity in order to offer them the goods they would likely need marketing thth months  primarily

than established customers and accredited investors the term accredited investor refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with a net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding  or  jointly with their spouse the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the sec which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account the bid and offer quotations and the brokerdealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to

this prospectus as of january   we had cash in the amount of  and liabilities of  as of this date we have no income and just recently started our operation the proceeds of this offering may not be sufficient for us to achieve revenues and profitable operations we need additional funds to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues there is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available on terms that will be acceptable to us we require minimum funding of approximately  to conduct our proposed operations for a period of one year if we are not able to raise this amount or if we experience a shortage of funds prior to funding we may utilize funds from shuisheng zhu our president treasurer and director who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and operation expenses however mr zhu has no formal commitment arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company after one year we may need additional financing if we do not generate sufficient revenue we may need a minimum of  of additional funding to pay for ongoing sec filing requirements we do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing   if we are successful in raising the funds from this offering we plan to commence activities to continue our operations we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to continue our business plan according to our plan of operations we are a development stage company and have commenced limited operations in our business we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future   we were incorporated on october   and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities we have commenced limited business operations accordingly we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises the likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to undertake these potential problems include but are not limited to unanticipated problems relating to the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates  we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing sufficient revenues we expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future we recognize that if the effectiveness of our business plan is not forthcoming we will not be able to continue business operations there is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations if we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks our business will most likely fail we have limited sales and marketing experience which increases the risk that our business will fail   we have no experience in the marketing of electronic toys distribution and have only nominal sales and marketing experience our future success will depend among other factors upon whether our services can be sold at a profitable price and the extent to which consumers acquire adopt and continue to use them there can be no assurance that our business will gain wide acceptance in its targeted markets or that we will be able to effectively market our services even though we are required to purchase our products in united states dollars our business can be effected by currency rate fluctuations as our suppliers are a chinese companies and all their operations are in chinese yuan we are required to buy products in us dollars but all our suppliers operations are in chinese yuan so we are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates if we are not able to successfully protect ourselves against those currency rate fluctuations then our profits on the products subject to those fluctuations would also fluctuate and could cause us to be less profitable or incur losses even if our business is doing well all of our electornic toys purchases will be made from a limited number of suppliers  if that suppliers decrease or terminate their relationship with us our business would likely fail if we are unable to find a substitute for these companies as a result of being totally dependent on a limited number of wholesale suppliers located in china we may be subject to certain risks including changes in regulatory requirements tariffs and other barriers increased pressure timing and availability of export licenses the burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws and treaties and uncertainties relative to regional political and economic circumstances if these companies decrease modify or terminate its association with us for any other reason we would suffer an interruption in our business unless and until we found a substitute for that suppliers if we were unable to find a substitute for that suppliers our business would likely fail we cannot predict what the likelihood would be of finding an acceptable substitute suppliers on march   we entered into a contract with our general supplier kingshau fingu toys co ltd   we are in a competitive market which could impact our ability to gain market share which could harm our financial performance   the business of niche of electronic toys distribution is very competitive barriers to entry are relatively low and we face competitive pressures from companies anxious to join this niche there are a number of successful entities operated by proven companies that offer similar niche services which may prevent us from gaining enough market share to become successful  these competitors have existing customers that may form a large part of our targeted client base and such clients may be hesitant to switch over from already established competitors to our service  if we cannot gain enough market share our business and our financial performance will be adversely affected some of our competitors may be able to use their financial strength to dominate the market which may affect our ability to generate revenues some of our competitors may be much larger companies than us and very well capitalized they could choose to use their greater resources to finance their continued participation and penetration of this market which may impede our ability to generate sufficient revenue to cover our costs their better financial resources could allow them to significantly out spend us on research and development as well as marketing and production we might not be able to maintain our ability to compete in this circumstance we cannot guarantee future customers even if we obtain customers there is no assurance that we will be able to generate a profit if that occurs we will have to cease operations we have not identified any customers and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract future customers even if we obtain new customers for our service there is no guarantee that we will make a profit if we are unable to attract enough customers to operate profitably we will have to suspend or cease operations because we are small and do not have much capital our marketing campaign may not be enough to attract sufficient number of customers to operate profitably if we do not make a profit we will suspend or cease operations due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital we must limit our marketing activities and may not be able to make our services known to potential customers because we will be limiting our marketing activities we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably if we cannot operate profitably we may have to suspend or cease operations because our operations are concentrated in china the stockholders would face difficulty in enforcing their legal rights under united states securities laws our operations are concentrated in china and our stockholders would face difficulty in enforcing their legal rights under united states securities laws in light of our managements location outside of the united states legal protections and remedies available to the company for certain harmful action taken against it will be pursued within the peoples republic of china legal system which differs from the us legal system in significant ways because the company conducts operations outside of the us it is difficult to pursue legal matters is subject to limitations imposed by other jurisdictions it is limited ability for us regulators to conduct investigations and inspections within china  it may be restrictions on the transfer of cash into and out of china as well as on the exchange of currency may constrain the companys liquidity and impede its ability to use cash in its operations because our president director and treasurer is engaged in a similar business to us there is a potential conflict of interest including the amount of time he is able to dedicate to rizzen inc and its business our sole officer and director is engaged in a similar business to us mr zhu is a selfemployed and senior partner of haunquoghang toy store in zhuhai china potential conflicts  of interest  may arise in future that may cause our business to fail  including the amount of time he is able to dedicate to our business as well as additional  conflict of interests over  opportunities presented to our sole officer and director during the performance of his duties  rizzen inc does not currently have a right of first refusal pertaining to opportunities that come to managements attention where the opportunity may relate to our proposed business operations in an effort to resolve such potential conflicts of interest our officers and sole director have agreed that all conflicts will be resolved verbally in favor of the rizzen inc we cannot provide assurances that our efforts to eliminate the potential impact of conflicts of interest will be effective moreover we dont intend to negotiate any agreements with haunquoghang as with potential customer because of haunquoghang store specializes on the other types of toys because we will purchase our products from overseas a disruption in the delivery of imported products may have a greater effect on us we will help to our potential clients to import our product from china to europe and north america because our product will be imported and delivered directly to our customers we believe that disruptions in shipping deliveries may have a greater material effect on us deliveries of our products may be disrupted through factors such as        raw material shortages work stoppages strikes and political unrest        problems with ocean shipping including work stoppages and shipping           container shortages        increased inspections of import shipments or other factors causing           delays in shipments and        economic crises international disputes and wars if a transportation company unable to deliver products our reputation may be damaged and we may lose customers if we are considered a resident enterprise for prc enterprise income tax purposes it could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our nonprc shareholders under paragraph  of article  of the peoples republic of china corporate income tax law the corporate income law any foreign enterprise which shall constitute a resident enterprise shall meet both of the following requirements i such enterprise was established under the laws of foreign countries or regions and ii the actual management of such enterprise must be located within china further under relevant provisions of the circular of the state administration of taxation regarding the issues relevant to the identification of chinesecontrolled enterprises registered abroad as resident enterprises by actual management guo shui fa  no  circular no  issued by the state administration of taxation on april   and based upon our noname inquiry to the peoples republic of china state administration for taxation any chinesecontrolled enterprise whose actual management is held to be located within china shall satisfy all of the following requirements i the site where the management of such enterprise responsible for the daily operation of such enterprise performs its duties is located within china ii the financial decisions such as borrowings extending loans financing or financial risks management and hr policies such as appointment dismissal or remunerations shall be made or approved by the institution or personnel of such enterprise staying within china iii  or more of the directors with voting rights or of the management of such enterprise live within china permanently and iv the main assets accounting books and stamps of and the minutes and files of the board of directors of and of shareholders meeting of such enterprise exist and will be maintained within china we believe that we are not considered a resident enterprise for prc enterprise income tax purposes we have no subsidiaries within china we have executive offices in china which were unincorporated entities under chinese laws and all of our management is located within china we make or approve the financial decisions such as borrowing extending loans financing or financial risks management and human resource policies such as employees appointment dismissal and remunerations within china and half or more of our directors with voting rights are also located within china however our main assets accounting books stamps and minutes of our directors board and of our shareholders meetings exist and will be maintained in the usa but not within china so we are not consistent with item iv of the above four requirements under circular no  although our present conditions satisfy items i to iii of the above requirements under circular no  therefore even if we are an enterprise established under the laws nevada and our management team is located within china we believe that we shall not be held to be a resident enterprise under the corporate income tax law nevertheless we cannot fully exclude the possibility that there is a difference or discrepancy between the interpretation of the chinese authorities and our understanding as set forth above nor can we assure that the statements or interpretations of the chinese government officials will remain unchanged furthermore we cannot exclude the possibility that the chinese government will promulgate any new laws regulations or provisions that will be in conflict with our understanding if so we may be classified as a resident enterprise for prc enterprise income tax purposes which could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our nonprc shareholders   if the prc tax authorities determine that we are a resident enterprise for prc enterprise income tax purposes we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of  on our worldwide taxable income as well as prc enterprise income tax reporting obligations    if we are considered a resident enterprise this could result in a situation in which a  withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our nonprc enterprise shareholders and with respect to gains derived by our nonprc enterprise shareholders from transferring our shares and a  withholding tax on dividends we pay to our nonprc individual stockholders and with respect to gains derived by our nonprc individual stockholders from transferring our shares if we are required under prc law to withhold prc income tax on dividends payable to our nonprc investors or if you are required to pay prc income tax on the transfer of our shares the value of your investment in our shares may be materially and adversely affected our operations and assets in china are subject to significant political and economic uncertainties government policies are subject to rapid change and the government of the china may adopt policies which have the effect of hindering private economic activity and greater economic decentralization  there is no assurance that the government of china will not significantly alter its policies from time to time without notice in a manner with reduces or eliminates any benefits from its present policies of economic reform  in addition a substantial portion of productive assets in china remains governmentowned  for instance all lands are state owned and business entities or individuals are granted by government stateowned land use rights  the granting process is typically based on government policies at the time of granting which could be lengthy and complex this process may adversely affect our business  the government of china also exercises significant control over chinas economic growth through the allocation of resources controlling payment of foreign currency and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies  uncertainties may arise with changing of governmental policies and measures  in addition changes in laws and regulations or their interpretation or the imposition of confiscatory taxation restrictions on currency conversion imports and sources of supply devaluations of currency the nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises as well as adverse changes in the political economic or social conditions in china could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition because chinese law governs almost all of our material agreements we may not be able to enforce our legal rights within china or elsewhere which could result in a significant loss of business business opportunities or capital   we have a supply agreement with kingshau fingu toys co ltd a chinese company we cannot assure you that we will be able to enforce this agreement or any of our material agreements that we may enter into or that remedies will be available outside of china  the system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws in china may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the united states the chinese judiciary is relatively inexperienced in enforcing corporate and commercial law leading to a higher than usual degree of uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation  the inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our agreements could result in a significant loss of business business opportunities or capital imposition of trade barriers and taxes may reduce our ability to do business internationally and the resulting loss of revenue could harm our profitability   we may experience barriers to conducting business and trade in our targeted emerging markets in the form of delayed customs clearances customs duties and tariffs  in addition we may be subject to repatriation taxes levied upon the exchange of income from local currency into foreign currency substantial taxes of profits revenues assets and payroll as well as valueadded tax the markets in which we plan to operate may impose onerous and unpredictable duties tariffs and taxes on our business and products and there can be no assurance that this will not reduce the level of sales that we achieve in such markets which would reduce our revenues and profits because our president treasurer and director mr zhu will own   or more of our outstanding common stock he will be able to make and control corporate decisions that may be disadvantageous to minority shareholders mr zhu our president treasurer and director will own   of the outstanding shares of our common stock in case if  of the shares sold or more than   accordingly he will have significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters including the election of directors mergers consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control the interests of mr zhu may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and may result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders we depend to a significant extent on certain key person the loss of whom may materially and adversely affect our company currently we have only two employee our president treasurer director mr shuisheng zhu and mr aleksandr deshin our secretary we depend entirely on shuisheng zhu our president treasurer director for all of our operations the loss of mr zhu would have a substantial negative effect on our company and may cause our business to fail mr zhu has not been compensated for his services since our incorporation and it is highly unlikely that he will receive any compensation unless and until we generate substantial revenues there is intense competition for skilled personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms the loss of mr zhus services could prevent us from completing the development of our plan of operation and our business in the event of the loss of services of such personnel no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the services of adequate replacement personnel we do not have any employment agreements or maintain key person life insurance policies on our officer and director we do not anticipate entering into employment agreements with him or acquiring key man insurance in the foreseeable future   because our president treasurer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations our operations may be sporadic which may result in periodic interruptions or suspensions of operations this activity could prevent us from attracting enough customers and result in a lack of revenues which may cause us to cease operations shuisheng zhu our president treasurer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations he will be devoting approximately  hours a week to our operations because our sole office and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to him as a result operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a possible cessation of operations our president treasurer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure control and procedures and internal control over financial reporting we have never operated as a public company shuisheng zhu our president treasurer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as a result we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company even if our operations are successful we plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations which are required for a public company that is reporting company with the securities and exchange commission however if we cannot operate successfully as a public company your investment may be materially adversely affected we are an emerging growth company under the jobs act and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors we qualify as an emerging growth company under the jobs act as a result we are permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements for so long as we are an emerging growth company we will not be required to  have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act  provide an auditor attestation with respect to managements report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting  comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements ie an auditor discussion and analysis  submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes such as sayonpay and sayonfrequency and  disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executives compensation to median employee compensation   in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards we will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is  billion ii the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in rule b under the securities exchange act of  which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by nonaffiliates is  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three year period until such time however we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile   risks associated with this offering because the offering price has been arbitrarily set by the company you may not realize a return on your investment upon resale of your shares   the offering price and other terms and conditions relative to the companys shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets earnings book value or any other objective financial criteria additionally as the company was formed on october   and has only a limited operating history with no earnings the price of the offered shares is not based on its past earnings and no investment banker appraiser or other independent third party has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares as such our stockholders may not be able to receive a return on their investment when they sell their shares of common stock we are selling this offering without an underwriter and may be unable to sell any shares   this offering is selfunderwritten that is we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares we intend to sell our shares through our president who will receive no commissions there is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares unless he is successful in receiving the proceeds in the amount of  from this offering we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our business plan the regulation of penny stocks by the sec and finra may discourage the tradability of the companys securities   the shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the securities and exchange act of  as amended the exchange act and rules of the commission the exchange act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on brokerdealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are generally institutions with assets in excess of  or individuals with net worth in excess of  or annual income exceeding   jointly with spouse or in transactions not recommended by the brokerdealer for transactions covered by the penny stock rules a broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations the compensation to be received by the brokerdealer and certain associated persons and deliver certain disclosures required by the commission consequently the penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase if at all our president mr zhu does not have any prior experience offering and selling securities  and our offering does not require a mimimum amount to be raised as a result of this we may not be able to raise enough funds to commence and sustain our business and investors may lose their entire investment mr zhu does not have any experience conducting a securities offering consequently we may not be able to raise any funds successfully also the best effort offering does not require a minimum amount to be raised if we are not able to raise sufficient funds we may not be able to fund our operations as planned and our business will suffer and your investment may be materially adversely affected our inability to successfully conduct a besteffort offering could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us due to the lack of a trading market for our securities you may have difficulty selling any shares you purchase in this offering we are not registered on any market or public stock exchange there is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus we plan to contact a market maker immediately following the completion of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the overthecounter bulletin board otcbb the otcbb is a regulated quotation service that displays realtime quotes last sale prices and volume information in overthecounter securities the otcbb is not an issuer listing service market or exchange although the otcbb does not have any listing requirements to be eligible for quotation on the otcbb issuers must remain current in their filings with the sec or applicable regulatory authority if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the otc bulletin board market makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement securities already quoted on the otcbb that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a  to  day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time we cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale as of the date of this filing there have been no discussions or understandings between rizzen inc and anyone acting on our behalf with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities if no market is ever developed for our common stock it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering in such a case you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay if at all in addition if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult if not impossible to ever resell your shares resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment   we will incur ongoing costs and expenses for sec reporting and compliance without revenue we may not be able to remain in compliance making it difficult for investors to sell their shares if at all   the estimated cost of this registration statement is  which will be paid from offering proceeds if the offering proceeds are less than registration cost we will have to utilize funds from shuisheng zhu our president treasurer and director who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process mr zhus verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non binding and discretionary after the effective date of this prospectus we will be required to file annual quarterly and current reports or other information with the sec as provided by the securities exchange act we will voluntarily continue reporting in the absence of an sec reporting obligation we plan to contact a market maker immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the otc electronic bulletin board to be eligible for quotation issuers must remain current in their filings with the sec in order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources the costs associated with being a publicly traded company in the next  month will be approximately  if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase if at all also if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the otc bulletin board the companys investors may suffer future dilution due to issuances of shares for various considerations in the future our articles of incorporation authorizes the issuance of  shares of common stock par value  per share of which  shares are currently issued and outstanding if we sell the  shares being offered in this offering we would have  shares issued and outstanding as discussed in the dilution section below the issuance of the shares of common stock described in this prospectus will result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our existing shareholders the issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock forward looking statements   this prospectus contains forwardlooking statements that involve risk and uncertainties we use words such as anticipate believe plan expect future intend and similar expressions to identify such forwardlooking statements investors should be aware that all forwardlooking statements contained within this filing are good faith estimates of management as of the date of this filing our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements for many reasons including the risks faced by us as described in the risk factors section and elsewhere in this prospectus   use of proceeds   our offering is being made on a selfunderwritten and bestefforts basis no minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed the offering price per share is  the following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of   and  respectively of the securities offered for sale by the company if we rise minimal amount of funds or we have not enough funds to follow our plan of operation we will need to loan the funds from our president director and treasurer mr zhu who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds or we will search for additional financing to implement our plan of operation there is no assurance that we will raise the full  as anticipated and there is no guarantee that we

registration process mr zhus verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non binding and discretionary also these loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the otc electronic bulletin board when and if our common stocks become eligible for trading on the overthecounter bulletin board mr zhu will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering there is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by mr zhu mr zhu will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation   determination of offering price   the offering price of the shares has been determined arbitrarily by us the price does not bear any relationship to our assets book value earnings or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company in determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering price we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plan accordingly the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of the securities dilution   dilution represents the difference between the offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this offering net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and from total assets dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the offering price of the shares being offered dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholder the historical net tangible book value as of january   was  or approximately  per share historical net tangible book value per share of common stock is equal to our total tangible assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of january   the following table sets forth as of january   the number of shares of common stock purchased from us and the total consideration paid by our existing

share the company computes loss per share in accordance with asc earnings per share which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period diluted loss per share
