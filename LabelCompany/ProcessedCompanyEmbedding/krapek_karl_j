barbara nagy and michael remez courant staff writers staff writer kenneth r gosselin contributed to this reportkarl j krapek the executive who rebuilt united technologies corps pratt  whitney division and was expected to succeed george david as utc chairman is abruptly leaving the companykrapek  will retire at the end of this month as utcs second in command  president and chief operating officerhe apparently has no other job lined up the sudden announcement stunned employees community leaders and even some of krapeks friendsi have come to a time in my life where other priorities are important to me and my family the onetime general motors corp manager said in a brief press release issued by utc after the stock markets closed late fridaydavid krapeks mentor during his year rise through the company said he will miss krapeks energy experience and counselneither was available for comment late fridayno one knew this was coming said one manager at pratts east hartford headquarters where executives were called together at  pm to hear the news there was not a rumblethe announcement led to speculation that david and krapek both known as energetic takecharge executives were not getting along the release contained just five paragraphs three of them about krapek the fourth reaffirmed wall streets estimates of utcs fourthquarter profits scheduled to be released next thursday and the last paragraph contained background about the companybut krapek who travels frequently and faces lengthy days at work has long lamented to friends about his lack of time with family krapek has held top civic positions  most notably in the redevelopment of downtown hartford  and seemed to enjoy the work but he had to cut back on commitments after moving from pratt to his corporate postanalysts expect utc stock to suffer monday when trading resumes but they said david will have plenty of time to find another successor they said they wouldnt be surprised if krapek is quickly hired by another company or even has something else already lined upit always hurts when you lose a top person said paul nisbet an analyst with jsa research in newport ri but he added david was not expected to retire soon and should have no trouble resuming control of daytoday operations until a successor to krapek can be foundim not going to change any earnings estimates or anything like that because of it nisbet saidpeople familiar with utc the states largest industrial employer have long wondered whether krapek would be content playing a supporting role at the company for another five years  assuming david didnt retire until he was  krapek once said his favorite job was running pontiacs fiero assembly line at gm  years ago because he had neartotal control  and responsibility  for the operationwall street analysts recently had suggested krapek as a candidate to head honeywell international inc a company david tried unsuccessfully to woo into a merger  months ago a year ago krapek was also mentioned as a possible candidate for an executive post at the boeing cokrapek was raised in osage iowa he has said his father a dentist gave him the drive to excel a young karl krapek worked his way up through gm before being hired as a vice president at utcs otis elevator cowhen david needed someone with manufacturing expertise to run utcs troubled pratt division in  he turned to krapekkrapek and a handful of trusted deputies used new efficientproduction techniques developed by toyota motor corp in japan to transform the jetengine company into a lean operation they eliminated thousands of jobs and forced pratts suppliers to cut costs steps that won krapek the disdain of many workersbut industry observers say that without the changes the company would not have survived analysts had hoped krapek would do the same with utcs other divisions over the yearstoday pratt is producing record profits and is spending hundreds of millions to develop new engines that it hopes will get it back in the growing market for smaller aircraftyou have to credit karl krapek with positioning the company to take advantage of that rep john b larson dst district said when krapek left pratt in  clearly that didnt come without pain and a lot of that pain was due directly to people being laid offwith success krapek has won national media attention and praise from wall street executives at utc have worried that krapek might be lured by a corporate talenthunter to jump to another company in  as an incentive to stay they gave krapek a position on the board of directors and lucrative stock
