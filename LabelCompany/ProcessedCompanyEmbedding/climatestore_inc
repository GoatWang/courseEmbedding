plan our core mission is to make it easy to live a climate friendly lifestyle  and were just getting started low carbon products from mission aligned suppliers to date weve sourced over  low carbon products from  suppliers we organized them into over  categories integrating them in blog posts and action plans were extremely excited about the pipeline of products from new and existing suppliers who are expanding their ecofriendly offerings fully reviewed for climate impact we rank all of our products based on impact to help sort things out we developed icons we hope will make things easier we review all our products for carbon impact and award icons to those that produce fewer greenhouse gases ghgs in either the production use andor disposal phases of their lifecycle we also award icons when products produce their own renewable green energy save money or have educational content and just for fun we have an icon for staff favorites a growing community were just starting to grow our community in the short time short time weve been active on social media weve grown to a community of k followers newsletter subscribers and customers but were most excited about the quality of mission climate change aligned institutions that are following us long term potential  growth we believe that climatestore has broad potential as a multichannel brand the five year business model includes revenue streams from direct website and mobile sales email remarketing affiliate programs and marketplaces affiliate revenues through partnerships are possible with membership driven environmentalorganizations home energy audit contractors and possibly utilities additional could come from referral relationships eg home solar and wind carbon offset relationships rewards
