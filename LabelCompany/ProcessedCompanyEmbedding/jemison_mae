organization and her mother worked most of her career as an elementary school teacher of english and math at the beethoven school in chicago the family moved to chicago illinois when jemison was three years old to take advantage of the better educational and employment opportunities there jemison says that as a young girl growing up in chicago she always assumed she would get into space i thought by now wed be going into space like you were going to work she said it was easier to apply to be a shuttle astronaut rather than waiting around in a cornfield waiting for et to pick me up or something in her childhood jemison learned to make connections to science by studying nature once when a splinter infected her thumb as a little girl jemisons mother turned it into a learning experience she ended up doing a whole project about pus jemisons parents were very supportive of her interest in science while her teachers were not in kindergarten my teacher asked me what i wanted to be when i grew up and i told her a scientist jemison says she said dont you mean a nurse now theres nothing wrong with being a nurse but thats not what i wanted to be in an interview with makers she further explains how her sheer interest in science was not accepted growing upi was just like every other kid i loved space stars and dinosaurs i always knew i wanted to explore at the time of the apollo airing everybody was thrilled about space but i remember being irritated that there were no women astronauts people tried to explain that to me and i did not buy it jemison says she was inspired by martin luther king jr to her kings dream was not an elusive fantasy but a call to action too often people paint him like santa  smiley and inoffensive says jemison but when i think of martin luther king i think of attitude audacity and bravery jemison thinks the civil rights movement was all about breaking down the barriers to human potential the best way to make dreams come true is to wake up jemison began dancing at the age of  i love dancing i took all kinds of dance — african dancing ballet jazz modern — even japanese dancing i wanted to become a professional dancer said jemison at the age of  she auditioned for the leading role of maria in west side story she did not get the part but jemisons dancing skills did get her into the line up as a background dancer i had a problem with the singing but i danced and acted pretty well enough for them to choose me i think that people sometimes limit themselves and so rob themselves of the opportunity to realise their dreams for me i love the sciences and i also love the arts says jemison i saw the theatre as an outlet for this passion and so i decided to pursue this dream later during her senior year in college she was trying to decide whether to go to new york to medical school or become a professional dancer her mother told her you can always dance if youre a doctor but you cant doctor if youre a dancer jemison graduated from chicagos morgan park high school in  and entered stanford university at the age of  i was naive and stubborn enough that it didn’t faze me jemison said it’s not until recently that i realized that  was particularly young or that there were even any issues associated with my parents having enough confidence in me to allow me to go that far away from home jemison graduated from stanford in  receiving a bs in chemical engineering and fulfilling the requirements for a ba in african and afroamerican studies she took initiative to get even further involved in the black community by serving as head of the black students union during her college years jemison said that majoring in engineering as a black woman was difficult because race was always an issue in the united states some professors would just pretend i wasnt there i would ask a question and a professor would act as if it was just so dumb the dumbest question he had ever heard then when a white guy would ask the same question the professor would say thats a very astute observation in an interview with the des moines register in  jemison said that it was difficult to go to stanford at  but thinks her youthful arrogance may have helped her i did have to say im going to do this and i dont give a crap damn she points out the unfairness of the necessity for women and minorities to have that attitude in some fields jemison obtained her doctor of medicine degree in  at cornell medical college she interned at los angeles countyusc medical center and later worked as a general practitioner during medical school jemison traveled to cuba kenya and thailand to provide primary medical care to people living there during her years at cornell medical college jemison took lessons in modern dance at the alvin ailey school jemison later built a dance studio in her home and has choreographed and produced several shows of modern jazz and african dance peace corps after completing her medical training jemison joined the staff of the peace corps and served as a peace corps medical officer from  to  responsible for the health of peace corps volunteers serving in liberia and sierra leone jemisons work in the peace corps included supervising the pharmacy laboratory medical staff as well as providing medical care writing selfcare manuals and developing and implementing guidelines for health and safety issues jemison also worked with the center for disease control cdc helping with research for various vaccines once while serving as a doctor for the peace corps a volunteer got sick and a doctor diagnosed malaria the volunteer got progressively worse and jemison was sure it was meningitis with lifethreatening complications that could not be treated in sierra leone jemison called for an air force hospital plane based in germany for a military medical evacuation at a cost of  the embassy questioned whether jemison had the authority to give such an order but she told them she did not need anyones permission for a medical decision by the time the plane reached germany with jemison and the volunteer on board she had been up with the patient for  hours the patient survived career jemison aboard the spacelab japan slj science module on the earthorbiting endeavour making her only flight in space jemison was joined by five other nasa astronauts and a japanese payload specialist for eight days of research in support of the slj mission a joint effort between japan and united states after the flight of sally ride in  jemison felt the astronaut program had opened up so she applied jemisons inspiration for joining nasa was africanamerican actress nichelle nichols who portrayed lieutenant uhura on star trek jemisons involvement with nasa was delayed after the space shuttle challenger disaster in  but after reapplying in  she received the news of her acceptance into the astronaut program i got a call saying are you still interested and i said yeah recalls jemison as one of fifteen candidates chosen out of roughly  applicants jemison at the kennedy space center in january  her work with nasa before her shuttle launch included launch support activities at the kennedy space center in florida and verification of shuttle computer software in the shuttle avionics integration laboratory sail i did things like help to support the launch of vehicles at kennedy space center said jemison i was in the first class of astronauts selected after the challenger accident back in   i actually worked the launch of the first flight after the challenger accident mae jemison space shuttle mission sts jemison flew her only space mission from september  to   as a mission specialist on sts a cooperative mission between the united states and japan as well as the th shuttle mission jemison was a coinvestigator of two bone cell research experiments one of  investigations that were done on sts jemison also conducted experiments on weightlessness and motion sickness on herself and six other crew members the first thing i saw from space was chicago my hometown said jemison i was working on the middeck where there arent many windows and as we passed over chicago the commander called me up to the flight deck it was such a significant moment because since i was a little girl i had always assumed i would go into space jemison added despite nasas rigid protocol jemison would begin each shift with a salute that only a trekkie could appreciate hailing frequencies open she could be heard repeating throughout the eightday mission because of her love of dance and as a salute to creativity jemison took a poster from the alvin ailey american dance theater along with her on the flight many people do not see a connection between science and dance says jemison but i consider them both to be expressions of the boundless creativity that people have to share with one another jemison also took several small art objects from west african countries to symbolize that space belongs to all nations also on this flight according to bessie coleman biographer doris l rich jemison also took into orbit a photo of coleman — coleman was the very first africanamerican woman to ever fly an airplane sts was a cooperative mission between the united states and japan that included  japanese and united states life science and materials processing experiments jemison logged  hours  minutes  seconds in space resignation jemison resigned from nasa in march  i left nasa because im very interested in how social sciences interact with technologies jemison said people always think of technology as something having silicon in it but a pencil is technology any language is technology technology is a tool we use to accomplish a particular task and when one talks about appropriate technology in developing countries appropriate may mean anything from fire to solar electricity nasa training manager and author homer hickam later expressed some regret that she had departed saying nasa had spent a lot of money training her she also filled a niche obviously being a woman of color hickam had trained jemison for her flight on spacelabjsts in an interview with the des moines register on october   jemison said that she was not driven to be the first black woman to go into space i wouldnt have cared less if  people had gone up before me i would still have had my

supervisor for a charity organization and her mother worked most of her career as an elementary school teacher of english and math at the beethoven school in chicago the family moved to chicago illinois when jemison was three years old to take advantage of the better educational and employment opportunities there jemison says that as a young girl growing up in chicago she always assumed she would get into space i thought by now wed be going into space like you were going to work she said it was easier to apply to be a shuttle astronaut rather than waiting around in a cornfield waiting for et to pick me up or something in her childhood jemison learned to make connections to science by studying nature once when a splinter infected her thumb as a little girl jemisons mother turned it into a learning experience she ended up doing a whole project about pus jemisons parents were very supportive of her interest in science while her teachers were not in kindergarten my teacher asked me what i wanted to be when i grew up and i told her a scientist jemison says she said dont you mean a nurse now theres nothing wrong with being a nurse but thats not what i wanted to be in an interview with makers she further explains how her sheer interest in science was not accepted growing upi was just like every other kid i loved space stars and dinosaurs i always knew i wanted to explore at the time of the apollo airing everybody was thrilled about space but i remember being irritated that there were no women astronauts people tried to explain that to me and i did not buy it jemison says she was inspired by martin luther king jr to her kings dream was not an elusive fantasy but a call to action too often people paint him like santa  smiley and inoffensive says jemison but when i think of martin luther king i think of attitude audacity and bravery jemison thinks the civil rights movement was all about breaking down the barriers to human potential the best way to make dreams come true is to wake up jemison began dancing at the age of  i love dancing i took all kinds of dance — african dancing ballet jazz modern — even japanese dancing i wanted to become a professional dancer said jemison at the age of  she auditioned for the leading role of maria in west side story she did not get the part but jemisons dancing skills did get her into the line up as a background dancer i had a problem with the singing but i danced and acted pretty well enough for them to choose me i think that people sometimes limit themselves and so rob themselves of the opportunity to realise their dreams for me i love the sciences and i also love the arts says jemison i saw the theatre as an outlet for this passion and so i decided to pursue this dream later during her senior year in college she was trying to decide whether to go to new york to medical school or become a professional dancer her mother told her you can always dance if youre a doctor but you cant doctor if youre a dancer jemison graduated from chicagos morgan park high school in  and entered stanford university at the age of  i was naive and stubborn enough that it didn’t faze me jemison said it’s not until recently that i realized that  was particularly young or that there were even any issues associated with my parents having enough confidence in me to allow me to go that far away from home jemison graduated from stanford in  receiving a bs in chemical engineering and fulfilling the requirements for a ba in african and afroamerican studies she took initiative to get even further involved in the black community by serving as head of the black students union during her college years jemison said that majoring in engineering as a black woman was difficult because race was always an issue in the united states some professors would just pretend i wasnt there i would ask a question and a professor would act as if it was just so dumb the dumbest question he had ever heard then when a white guy would ask the same question the professor would say thats a very astute observation in an interview with the des moines register in  jemison said that it was difficult to go to stanford at  but thinks her youthful arrogance may have helped her i did have to say im going to do this and i dont give a crap damn she points out the unfairness of the necessity for women and minorities to have that attitude in some fields jemison obtained her doctor of medicine degree in  at cornell medical college she interned at los angeles countyusc medical center and later worked as a general practitioner during medical school jemison traveled to cuba kenya and thailand to provide primary medical care to people living there during her years at cornell medical college jemison took lessons in modern dance at the alvin ailey school jemison later built a dance studio in her home and has choreographed and produced several shows of modern jazz and african dance peace corps after completing her medical training jemison joined the staff of the peace corps and served as a peace corps medical officer from  to  responsible for the health of peace corps volunteers serving in liberia and sierra leone jemisons work in the peace corps included supervising the pharmacy laboratory medical staff as well as providing medical care writing selfcare manuals and developing and implementing guidelines for health and safety issues jemison also worked with the center for disease control cdc helping with research for various vaccines once while serving as a doctor for the peace corps a volunteer got sick and a doctor diagnosed malaria the volunteer got progressively worse and jemison was sure it was meningitis with lifethreatening complications that could not be treated in sierra leone jemison called for an air force hospital plane based in germany for a military medical evacuation at a cost of  the embassy questioned whether jemison had the authority to give such an order but she told them she did not need anyones permission for a medical decision by the time the plane reached germany with jemison and the volunteer on board she had been up with the patient for  hours the patient survived career jemison aboard the spacelab japan slj science module on the earthorbiting endeavour making her only flight in space jemison was joined by five other nasa astronauts and a japanese payload specialist for eight days of research in support of the slj mission a joint effort between japan and united states after the flight of sally ride in  jemison felt the astronaut program had opened up so she applied jemisons inspiration for joining nasa was africanamerican actress nichelle nichols who portrayed lieutenant uhura on star trek jemisons involvement with nasa was delayed after the space shuttle challenger disaster in  but after reapplying in  she received the news of her acceptance into the astronaut program i got a call saying are you still interested and i said yeah recalls jemison as one of fifteen candidates chosen out of roughly  applicants jemison at the kennedy space center in january  her work with nasa before her shuttle launch included launch support activities at the kennedy space center in florida and verification of shuttle computer software in the shuttle avionics integration laboratory sail i did things like help to support the launch of vehicles at kennedy space center said jemison i was in the first class of astronauts selected after the challenger accident back in   i actually worked the launch of the first flight after the challenger accident mae jemison space shuttle mission sts jemison flew her only space mission from september  to   as a mission specialist on sts a cooperative mission between the united states and japan as well as the th shuttle mission jemison was a coinvestigator of two bone cell research experiments one of  investigations that were done on sts jemison also conducted experiments on weightlessness and motion sickness on herself and six other crew members the first thing i saw from space was chicago my hometown said jemison i was working on the middeck where there arent many windows and as we passed over chicago the commander called me up to the flight deck it was such a significant moment because since i was a little girl i had always assumed i would go into space jemison added despite nasas rigid protocol jemison would begin each shift with a salute that only a trekkie could appreciate hailing frequencies open she could be heard repeating throughout the eightday mission because of her love of dance and as a salute to creativity jemison took a poster from the alvin ailey american dance theater along with her on the flight many people do not see a connection between science and dance says jemison but i consider them both to be expressions of the boundless creativity that people have to share with one another jemison also took several small art objects from west african countries to symbolize that space belongs to all nations also on this flight according to bessie coleman biographer doris l rich jemison also took into orbit a photo of coleman — coleman was the very first africanamerican woman to ever fly an airplane sts was a cooperative mission between the united states and japan that included  japanese and united states life science and materials processing experiments jemison logged  hours  minutes  seconds in space resignation jemison resigned from nasa in march  i left nasa because im very interested in how social sciences interact with technologies jemison said people always think of technology as something having silicon in it but a pencil is technology any language is technology technology is a tool we use to accomplish a particular task and when one talks about appropriate technology in developing countries appropriate may mean anything from fire to solar electricity nasa training manager and author homer hickam later expressed some regret that she had departed saying nasa had spent a lot of money training her she also filled a niche obviously being a woman of color hickam had trained jemison for her flight on spacelabjsts in an interview with the des moines register on october   jemison said that she was not driven to be the first black woman to go into space i wouldnt have cared less if  people had gone up before me i would still have had my hand up i want to do this science and technology jemison is a professoratlarge at cornell university and was a professor of environmental studies at dartmouth college from  to  jemison continues to

supervisor for a charity organization and her mother worked most of her career as an elementary school teacher of english and math at the beethoven school in chicago the family moved to chicago illinois when jemison was three years old to take advantage of the better educational and employment opportunities there jemison says that as a young girl growing up in chicago she always assumed she would get into space i thought by now wed be going into space like you were going to work she said it was easier to apply to be a shuttle astronaut rather than waiting around in a cornfield waiting for et to pick me up or something in her childhood jemison learned to make connections to science by studying nature once when a splinter infected her thumb as a little girl jemisons mother turned it into a learning experience she ended up doing a whole project about pus jemisons parents were very supportive of her interest in science while her teachers were not in kindergarten my teacher asked me what i wanted to be when i grew up and i told her a scientist jemison says she said dont you mean a nurse now theres nothing wrong with being a nurse but thats not what i wanted to be in an interview with makers she further explains how her sheer interest in science was not accepted growing upi was just like every other kid i loved space stars and dinosaurs i always knew i wanted to explore at the time of the apollo airing everybody was thrilled about space but i remember being irritated that there were no women astronauts people tried to explain that to me and i did not buy it jemison says she was inspired by martin luther king jr to her kings dream was not an elusive fantasy but a call to action too often people paint him like santa  smiley and inoffensive says jemison but when i think of martin luther king i think of attitude audacity and bravery jemison thinks the civil rights movement was all about breaking down the barriers to human potential the best way to make dreams come true is to wake up jemison began dancing at the age of  i love dancing i took all kinds of dance — african dancing ballet jazz modern — even japanese dancing i wanted to become a professional dancer said jemison at the age of  she auditioned for the leading role of maria in west side story she did not get the part but jemisons dancing skills did get her into the line up as a background dancer i had a problem with the singing but i danced and acted pretty well enough for them to choose me i think that people sometimes limit themselves and so rob themselves of the opportunity to realise their dreams for me i love the sciences and i also love the arts says jemison i saw the theatre as an outlet for this passion and so i decided to pursue this dream later during her senior year in college she was trying to decide whether to go to new york to medical school or become a professional dancer her mother told her you can always dance if youre a doctor but you cant doctor if youre a dancer jemison graduated from chicagos morgan park high school in  and entered stanford university at the age of  i was naive and stubborn enough that it didn’t faze me jemison said it’s not until recently that i realized that  was particularly young or that there were even any issues associated with my parents having enough confidence in me to allow me to go that far away from home jemison graduated from stanford in  receiving a bs in chemical engineering and fulfilling the requirements for a ba in african and afroamerican studies she took initiative to get even further involved in the black community by serving as head of the black students union during her college years jemison said that majoring in engineering as a black woman was difficult because race was always an issue in the united states some professors would just pretend i wasnt there i would ask a question and a professor would act as if it was just so dumb the dumbest question he had ever heard then when a white guy would ask the same question the professor would say thats a very astute observation in an interview with the des moines register in  jemison said that it was difficult to go to stanford at  but thinks her youthful arrogance may have helped her i did have to say im going to do this and i dont give a crap damn she points out the unfairness of the necessity for women and minorities to have that attitude in some fields jemison obtained her doctor of medicine degree in  at cornell medical college she interned at los angeles countyusc medical center and later worked as a general practitioner during medical school jemison traveled to cuba kenya and thailand to provide primary medical care to people living there during her years at cornell medical college jemison took lessons in modern dance at the alvin ailey school jemison later built a dance studio in her home and has choreographed and produced several shows of modern jazz and african dance peace corps after completing her medical training jemison joined the staff of the peace corps and served as a peace corps medical officer from  to  responsible for the health of peace corps volunteers serving in liberia and sierra leone jemisons work in the peace corps included supervising the pharmacy laboratory medical staff as well as providing medical care writing selfcare manuals and developing and implementing guidelines for health and safety issues jemison also worked with the center for disease control cdc helping with research for various vaccines once while serving as a doctor for the peace corps a volunteer got sick and a doctor diagnosed malaria the volunteer got progressively worse and jemison was sure it was meningitis with lifethreatening complications that could not be treated in sierra leone jemison called for an air force hospital plane based in germany for a military medical evacuation at a cost of  the embassy questioned whether jemison had the authority to give such an order but she told them she did not need anyones permission for a medical decision by the time the plane reached germany with jemison and the volunteer on board she had been up with the patient for  hours the patient survived career jemison aboard the spacelab japan slj science module on the earthorbiting endeavour making her only flight in space jemison was joined by five other nasa astronauts and a japanese payload specialist for eight days of research in support of the slj mission a joint effort between japan and united states after the flight of sally ride in  jemison felt the astronaut program had opened up so she applied jemisons inspiration for joining nasa was africanamerican actress nichelle nichols who portrayed lieutenant uhura on star trek jemisons involvement with nasa was delayed after the space shuttle challenger disaster in  but after reapplying in  she received the news of her acceptance into the astronaut program i got a call saying are you still interested and i said yeah recalls jemison as one of fifteen candidates chosen out of roughly  applicants jemison at the kennedy space center in january  her work with nasa before her shuttle launch included launch support activities at the kennedy space center in florida and verification of shuttle computer software in the shuttle avionics integration laboratory sail i did things like help to support the launch of vehicles at kennedy space center said jemison i was in the first class of astronauts selected after the challenger accident back in   i actually worked the launch of the first flight after the challenger accident mae jemison space shuttle mission sts jemison flew her only space mission from september  to   as a mission specialist on sts a cooperative mission between the united states and japan as well as the th shuttle mission jemison was a coinvestigator of two bone cell research experiments one of  investigations that were done on sts jemison also conducted experiments on weightlessness and motion sickness on herself and six other crew members the first thing i saw from space was chicago my hometown said jemison i was working on the middeck where there arent many windows and as we passed over chicago the commander called me up to the flight deck it was such a significant moment because since i was a little girl i had always assumed i would go into space jemison added despite nasas rigid protocol jemison would begin each shift with a salute that only a trekkie could appreciate hailing frequencies open she could be heard repeating throughout the eightday mission because of her love of dance and as a salute to creativity jemison took a poster from the alvin ailey american dance theater along with her on the flight many people do not see a connection between science and dance says jemison but i consider them both to be expressions of the boundless creativity that people have to share with one another jemison also took several small art objects from west african countries to symbolize that space belongs to all nations also on this flight according to bessie coleman biographer doris l rich jemison also took into orbit a photo of coleman — coleman was the very first africanamerican woman to ever fly an airplane sts was a cooperative mission between the united states and japan that included  japanese and united states life science and materials processing experiments jemison logged  hours  minutes  seconds in space resignation jemison resigned from nasa in march  i left nasa because im very interested in how social sciences interact with technologies jemison said people always think of technology as something having silicon in it but a pencil is technology any language is technology technology is a tool we use to accomplish a particular task and when one talks about appropriate technology in developing countries appropriate may mean anything from fire to solar electricity nasa training manager and author homer hickam later expressed some regret that she had departed saying nasa had spent a lot of money training her she also filled a niche obviously being a woman of color hickam had trained jemison for her flight on spacelabjsts in an interview with the des moines register on october   jemison said that she was not driven to be the first black woman to go into space i wouldnt have cared less if  people had gone up before me i would still have had my hand up i want to do this science and technology jemison is a professoratlarge at cornell university and was a professor of environmental studies at dartmouth college from  to  jemison continues to

supervisor for a charity organization and her mother worked most of her career as an elementary school teacher of english and math at the beethoven school in chicago the family moved to chicago illinois when jemison was three years old to take advantage of the better educational and employment opportunities there jemison says that as a young girl growing up in chicago she always assumed she would get into space i thought by now wed be going into space like you were going to work she said it was easier to apply to be a shuttle astronaut rather than waiting around in a cornfield waiting for et to pick me up or something in her childhood jemison learned to make connections to science by studying nature once when a splinter infected her thumb as a little girl jemisons mother turned it into a learning experience she ended up doing a whole project about pus jemisons parents were very supportive of her interest in science while her teachers were not in kindergarten my teacher asked me what i wanted to be when i grew up and i told her a scientist jemison says she said dont you mean a nurse now theres nothing wrong with being a nurse but thats not what i wanted to be in an interview with makers she further explains how her sheer interest in science was not accepted growing upi was just like every other kid i loved space stars and dinosaurs i always knew i wanted to explore at the time of the apollo airing everybody was thrilled about space but i remember being irritated that there were no women astronauts people tried to explain that to me and i did not buy it jemison says she was inspired by martin luther king jr to her kings dream was not an elusive fantasy but a call to action too often people paint him like santa  smiley and inoffensive says jemison but when i think of martin luther king i think of attitude audacity and bravery jemison thinks the civil rights movement was all about breaking down the barriers to human potential the best way to make dreams come true is to wake up jemison began dancing at the age of  i love dancing i took all kinds of dance — african dancing ballet jazz modern — even japanese dancing i wanted to become a professional dancer said jemison at the age of  she auditioned for the leading role of maria in west side story she did not get the part but jemisons dancing skills did get her into the line up as a background dancer i had a problem with the singing but i danced and acted pretty well enough for them to choose me i think that people sometimes limit themselves and so rob themselves of the opportunity to realise their dreams for me i love the sciences and i also love the arts says jemison i saw the theatre as an outlet for this passion and so i decided to pursue this dream later during her senior year in college she was trying to decide whether to go to new york to medical school or become a professional dancer her mother told her you can always dance if youre a doctor but you cant doctor if youre a dancer jemison graduated from chicagos morgan park high school in  and entered stanford university at the age of  i was naive and stubborn enough that it didn’t faze me jemison said it’s not until recently that i realized that  was particularly young or that there were even any issues associated with my parents having enough confidence in me to allow me to go that far away from home jemison graduated from stanford in  receiving a bs in chemical engineering and fulfilling the requirements for a ba in african and afroamerican studies she took initiative to get even further involved in the black community by serving as head of the black students union during her college years jemison said that majoring in engineering as a black woman was difficult because race was always an issue in the united states some professors would just pretend i wasnt there i would ask a question and a professor would act as if it was just so dumb the dumbest question he had ever heard then when a white guy would ask the same question the professor would say thats a very astute observation in an interview with the des moines register in  jemison said that it was difficult to go to stanford at  but thinks her youthful arrogance may have helped her i did have to say im going to do this and i dont give a crap damn she points out the unfairness of the necessity for women and minorities to have that attitude in some fields jemison obtained her doctor of medicine degree in  at cornell medical college she interned at los angeles countyusc medical center and later worked as a general practitioner during medical school jemison traveled to cuba kenya and thailand to provide primary medical care to people living there during her years at cornell medical college jemison took lessons in modern dance at the alvin ailey school jemison later built a dance studio in her home and has choreographed and produced several shows of modern jazz and african dance peace corps after completing her medical training jemison joined the staff of the peace corps and served as a peace corps medical officer from  to  responsible for the health of peace corps volunteers serving in liberia and sierra leone jemisons work in the peace corps included supervising the pharmacy laboratory medical staff as well as providing medical care writing selfcare manuals and developing and implementing guidelines for health and safety issues jemison also worked with the center for disease control cdc helping with research for various vaccines once while serving as a doctor for the peace corps a volunteer got sick and a doctor diagnosed malaria the volunteer got progressively worse and jemison was sure it was meningitis with lifethreatening complications that could not be treated in sierra leone jemison called for an air force hospital plane based in germany for a military medical evacuation at a cost of  the embassy questioned whether jemison had the authority to give such an order but she told them she did not need anyones permission for a medical decision by the time the plane reached germany with jemison and the volunteer on board she had been up with the patient for  hours the patient survived career jemison aboard the spacelab japan slj science module on the earthorbiting endeavour making her only flight in space jemison was joined by five other nasa astronauts and a japanese payload specialist for eight days of research in support of the slj mission a joint effort between japan and united states after the flight of sally ride in  jemison felt the astronaut program had opened up so she applied jemisons inspiration for joining nasa was africanamerican actress nichelle nichols who portrayed lieutenant uhura on star trek jemisons involvement with nasa was delayed after the space shuttle challenger disaster in  but after reapplying in  she received the news of her acceptance into the astronaut program i got a call saying are you still interested and i said yeah recalls jemison as one of fifteen candidates chosen out of roughly  applicants jemison at the kennedy space center in january  her work with nasa before her shuttle launch included launch support activities at the kennedy space center in florida and verification of shuttle computer software in the shuttle avionics integration laboratory sail i did things like help to support the launch of vehicles at kennedy space center said jemison i was in the first class of astronauts selected after the challenger accident back in   i actually worked the launch of the first flight after the challenger accident mae jemison space shuttle mission sts jemison flew her only space mission from september  to   as a mission specialist on sts a cooperative mission between the united states and japan as well as the th shuttle mission jemison was a coinvestigator of two bone cell research experiments one of  investigations that were done on sts jemison also conducted experiments on weightlessness and motion sickness on herself and six other crew members the first thing i saw from space was chicago my hometown said jemison i was working on the middeck where there arent many windows and as we passed over chicago the commander called me up to the flight deck it was such a significant moment because since i was a little girl i had always assumed i would go into space jemison added despite nasas rigid protocol jemison would begin each shift with a salute that only a trekkie could appreciate hailing frequencies open she could be heard repeating throughout the eightday mission because of her love of dance and as a salute to creativity jemison took a poster from the alvin ailey american dance theater along with her on the flight many people do not see a connection between science and dance says jemison but i consider them both to be expressions of the boundless creativity that people have to share with one another jemison also took several small art objects from west african countries to symbolize that space belongs to all nations also on this flight according to bessie coleman biographer doris l rich jemison also took into orbit a photo of coleman — coleman was the very first africanamerican woman to ever fly an airplane sts was a cooperative mission between the united states and japan that included  japanese and united states life science and materials processing experiments jemison logged  hours  minutes  seconds in space resignation jemison resigned from nasa in march  i left nasa because im very interested in how social sciences interact with technologies jemison said people always think of technology as something having silicon in it but a pencil is technology any language is technology technology is a tool we use to accomplish a particular task and when one talks about appropriate technology in developing countries appropriate may mean anything from fire to solar electricity nasa training manager and author homer hickam later expressed some regret that she had departed saying nasa had spent a lot of money training her she also filled a niche obviously being a woman of color hickam had trained jemison for her flight on spacelabjsts in an interview with the des moines register on october   jemison said that she was not driven to be the first black woman to go into space i wouldnt have cared less if  people had gone up before me i would still have had my hand up i want to do this science and technology jemison is a professoratlarge at cornell university and was a professor of environmental studies at dartmouth college from  to  jemison continues to

supervisor for a charity organization and her mother worked most of her career as an elementary school teacher of english and math at the beethoven school in chicago the family moved to chicago illinois when jemison was three years old to take advantage of the better educational and employment opportunities there jemison says that as a young girl growing up in chicago she always assumed she would get into space i thought by now wed be going into space like you were going to work she said it was easier to apply to be a shuttle astronaut rather than waiting around in a cornfield waiting for et to pick me up or something in her childhood jemison learned to make connections to science by studying nature once when a splinter infected her thumb as a little girl jemisons mother turned it into a learning experience she ended up doing a whole project about pus jemisons parents were very supportive of her interest in science while her teachers were not in kindergarten my teacher asked me what i wanted to be when i grew up and i told her a scientist jemison says she said dont you mean a nurse now theres nothing wrong with being a nurse but thats not what i wanted to be in an interview with makers she further explains how her sheer interest in science was not accepted growing upi was just like every other kid i loved space stars and dinosaurs i always knew i wanted to explore at the time of the apollo airing everybody was thrilled about space but i remember being irritated that there were no women astronauts people tried to explain that to me and i did not buy it jemison says she was inspired by martin luther king jr to her kings dream was not an elusive fantasy but a call to action too often people paint him like santa  smiley and inoffensive says jemison but when i think of martin luther king i think of attitude audacity and bravery jemison thinks the civil rights movement was all about breaking down the barriers to human potential the best way to make dreams come true is to wake up jemison began dancing at the age of  i love dancing i took all kinds of dance — african dancing ballet jazz modern — even japanese dancing i wanted to become a professional dancer said jemison at the age of  she auditioned for the leading role of maria in west side story she did not get the part but jemisons dancing skills did get her into the line up as a background dancer i had a problem with the singing but i danced and acted pretty well enough for them to choose me i think that people sometimes limit themselves and so rob themselves of the opportunity to realise their dreams for me i love the sciences and i also love the arts says jemison i saw the theatre as an outlet for this passion and so i decided to pursue this dream later during her senior year in college she was trying to decide whether to go to new york to medical school or become a professional dancer her mother told her you can always dance if youre a doctor but you cant doctor if youre a dancer jemison graduated from chicagos morgan park high school in  and entered stanford university at the age of  i was naive and stubborn enough that it didn’t faze me jemison said it’s not until recently that i realized that  was particularly young or that there were even any issues associated with my parents having enough confidence in me to allow me to go that far away from home jemison graduated from stanford in  receiving a bs in chemical engineering and fulfilling the requirements for a ba in african and afroamerican studies she took initiative to get even further involved in the black community by serving as head of the black students union during her college years jemison said that majoring in engineering as a black woman was difficult because race was always an issue in the united states some professors would just pretend i wasnt there i would ask a question and a professor would act as if it was just so dumb the dumbest question he had ever heard then when a white guy would ask the same question the professor would say thats a very astute observation in an interview with the des moines register in  jemison said that it was difficult to go to stanford at  but thinks her youthful arrogance may have helped her i did have to say im going to do this and i dont give a crap damn she points out the unfairness of the necessity for women and minorities to have that attitude in some fields jemison obtained her doctor of medicine degree in  at cornell medical college she interned at los angeles countyusc medical center and later worked as a general practitioner during medical school jemison traveled to cuba kenya and thailand to provide primary medical care to people living there during her years at cornell medical college jemison took lessons in modern dance at the alvin ailey school jemison later built a dance studio in her home and has choreographed and produced several shows of modern jazz and african dance peace corps after completing her medical training jemison joined the staff of the peace corps and served as a peace corps medical officer from  to  responsible for the health of peace corps volunteers serving in liberia and sierra leone jemisons work in the peace corps included supervising the pharmacy laboratory medical staff as well as providing medical care writing selfcare manuals and developing and implementing guidelines for health and safety issues jemison also worked with the center for disease control cdc helping with research for various vaccines once while serving as a doctor for the peace corps a volunteer got sick and a doctor diagnosed malaria the volunteer got progressively worse and jemison was sure it was meningitis with lifethreatening complications that could not be treated in sierra leone jemison called for an air force hospital plane based in germany for a military medical evacuation at a cost of  the embassy questioned whether jemison had the authority to give such an order but she told them she did not need anyones permission for a medical decision by the time the plane reached germany with jemison and the volunteer on board she had been up with the patient for  hours the patient survived career jemison aboard the spacelab japan slj science module on the earthorbiting endeavour making her only flight in space jemison was joined by five other nasa astronauts and a japanese payload specialist for eight days of research in support of the slj mission a joint effort between japan and united states after the flight of sally ride in  jemison felt the astronaut program had opened up so she applied jemisons inspiration for joining nasa was africanamerican actress nichelle nichols who portrayed lieutenant uhura on star trek jemisons involvement with nasa was delayed after the space shuttle challenger disaster in  but after reapplying in  she received the news of her acceptance into the astronaut program i got a call saying are you still interested and i said yeah recalls jemison as one of fifteen candidates chosen out of roughly  applicants jemison at the kennedy space center in january  her work with nasa before her shuttle launch included launch support activities at the kennedy space center in florida and verification of shuttle computer software in the shuttle avionics integration laboratory sail i did things like help to support the launch of vehicles at kennedy space center said jemison i was in the first class of astronauts selected after the challenger accident back in   i actually worked the launch of the first flight after the challenger accident mae jemison space shuttle mission sts jemison flew her only space mission from september  to   as a mission specialist on sts a cooperative mission between the united states and japan as well as the th shuttle mission jemison was a coinvestigator of two bone cell research experiments one of  investigations that were done on sts jemison also conducted experiments on weightlessness and motion sickness on herself and six other crew members the first thing i saw from space was chicago my hometown said jemison i was working on the middeck where there arent many windows and as we passed over chicago the commander called me up to the flight deck it was such a significant moment because since i was a little girl i had always assumed i would go into space jemison added despite nasas rigid protocol jemison would begin each shift with a salute that only a trekkie could appreciate hailing frequencies open she could be heard repeating throughout the eightday mission because of her love of dance and as a salute to creativity jemison took a poster from the alvin ailey american dance theater along with her on the flight many people do not see a connection between science and dance says jemison but i consider them both to be expressions of the boundless creativity that people have to share with one another jemison also took several small art objects from west african countries to symbolize that space belongs to all nations also on this flight according to bessie coleman biographer doris l rich jemison also took into orbit a photo of coleman — coleman was the very first africanamerican woman to ever fly an airplane sts was a cooperative mission between the united states and japan that included  japanese and united states life science and materials processing experiments jemison logged  hours  minutes  seconds in space resignation jemison resigned from nasa in march  i left nasa because im very interested in how social sciences interact with technologies jemison said people always think of technology as something having silicon in it but a pencil is technology any language is technology technology is a tool we use to accomplish a particular task and when one talks about appropriate technology in developing countries appropriate may mean anything from fire to solar electricity nasa training manager and author homer hickam later expressed some regret that she had departed saying nasa had spent a lot of money training her she also filled a niche obviously being a woman of color hickam had trained jemison for her flight on spacelabjsts in an interview with the des moines register on october   jemison said that she was not driven to be the first black woman to go into space i wouldnt have cared less if  people had gone up before me i would still have had my hand up i want to do this science and technology jemison is a professoratlarge at cornell university and was a professor of environmental studies at dartmouth college from  to  jemison continues to

that they are different sides of the same coin even or even different parts of the same continuum but rather they are manifestations of the same thing the arts and sciences are avatars of human creativity mae jemison creativity science human what we find is that if you have a goal that is very very far out and you approach it in little steps you start to get there faster your mind opens up to the possibilities mae jemison goal mind start science provides an understanding of a universal experience arts provide a universal understanding of a personal experience mae jemison experience
