call though when det owen mackey cal’s policeman cousin asks for their help in his pursuit of ira sympathizers who are running guns and murdering suspected informers the irish club scene of the time has a role in the story as does dante’s skill at the piano but the unforgiving temperatures easy violence and grim state of the south boston neighborhoods overwhelm any joy that the bright lights and

the homeland for the ira and sends his soldiers to fix the problem of a stalled shipment the war of republicans and royalists is imported to boston harbor its hard not to compare this novel with its predecessor especially with an overabundance of references to the back story but this one drags although omalley and purdy do violence extremely well the suspense in this story is anemic—an endless watch of sitting in cars and drinking sitting in bars and drinking cal and dante each wallowing in flashbacks to life before trauma the story starts well as the mystery builds on the body count but once the reader knows whos on the killing end and whos trying to take control of the missing boatload of guns it becomes predictable one good outnumbered shootout to close the loop and the novel ends with a fizzle this book feels like a place holder for the next the authors deliver noir done well in darkcity descriptions and a cast of damaged characters but fall short on delivering a thrill show
