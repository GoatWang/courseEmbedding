demo faq what is pagerduty pagerduty is an alarm aggregation and dispatching service for system administrators and support teams it collects alerts from your monitoring tools gives you an overall view of all of your monitoring alarms and alerts an on duty engineer if there’s a problem is pagerduty right for me you should consider using pagerduty if you want to add the ability to send smses and phone calls to your existing monitoring tools you want to add oncall scheduling escalation and incident tracking to your existing monitoring tools you want a single place where you can view the overall health of your system no matter how many monitoring tools you use can pagerduty route alerts depending on the source of the problem yes pagerduty uses “services” to integrate with your monitoring systems each pagerduty service has its own associated alerting and escalation rules these are called “escalation policies” this feature is used to route alerts to the people best able to handle them for example you might want to create an escalation policy for your database administrator team and use this policy for all services that integrate with database monitoring systems this ensures that database problems are always forwarded to a db specialist what alerting methods do you support we can send alerts using any combination of phone calls smses push notifications and emails how can i be sure my alerts are received pagerduty asks users to confirm that they’ve received an sms by replying to it similarly our automated phone calls ask users to make a selection from a voice menu of possible incident options if an alert isn’t replied to pagerduty can be set to repeat the call or message what if the oncall engineer doesn’t respond to an alert pagerduty allows you to specify comprehensive escalation rules when an incident is triggered pagerduty will first try to contact the levelone oncall engineer for the incident if that person doesn’t answer within the userspecified escalation timeout pagerduty will automatically escalate the alert to the leveltwo engineer and so on do you support international sms yes we support twoway sms to virtually every country do you support international phone calls yes we support phone calls to over  countries to learn more about international calls in pagerduty and to view the full list of supported countries click here how do phone alerts show up on my phone’s caller id all pagerduty phone alerts will be attempted to be sent from the number  unfortunately some providers will change the caller id which is out of our control so the numbers you receive the calls from may be displayed differently  see the following faq entry for sms alerts how do sms alerts show up on my phone’s caller id the phone number that will show up on your caller id for sms alerts will depend on which sms provider we use as well as which country you live in pagerduty uses multiple sms providers per country for availability and redundancy reasons you can use the below numbers to setup special ringtones on your phone but please be aware that they might change at any time with little notice please also see our vcard for additional numbers usa primary number pduty   or  backup numbers                        canada primary number  backup numbers       united kingdom    backup numbers       australia

numbers vary note some phone numbers use local sms numbers that can vary between messages or daytoday what if an engineer receives an alert when they are away from their computer engineers can escalate alarms directly from their phone by replying to the alert sms or pressing a key during the automated phone call i’ve spent a long time setting up monitoring tools to watch my systems if i switch to pagerduty do i have to redo all that work no pagerduty is an alert dispatching tool not a monitoring system think of pagerduty as an addon to your existing monitoring tools pagerduty provides sophisticated alarm routing but leaves finding problems with your systems to your existing monitoring tools how does it integrate with my existing tools every service you create in pagerduty has a unique email address such as nagiosproblemacmepagerdutycom pagerduty opens a new incident and begins the alerting process at soon as one of your monitoring tools sends email to a service’s address what monitoring tools are known to work with pagerduty the most common monitoring tools used with pagerduty are nagios zenoss pingdom monit munin splunk and basicstate however any monitoring tool that sends email can be used with pagerduty what other uses are there for pagerduty pagerduty can be integrated with any system that sends automated emails pagerduty is especially useful when used to deliver alerts for systems that can’t place phone calls or smses on their own here are some possibilities have your applications call you if an unexpected exception is raised if you’re using ruby on rails take a look at exceptionnotifier your cron tasks can call you if a critical system maintenance task fails intrusion detection systems can be set to call you if they detect a security breach environmental sensors ex temperature humidity etc can alert you if they detect an unsafe environment what precautions have you taken to ensure that pagerduty is always ready to deliver my alerts pagerduty’s infrastructure is fully replicated in three different aws and microsoft azure data centers we have the capability to rapidly rollover to our backup systems in the event that our main data center loses connectivity we always have an engineer oncall and near a computer to deal with any unexpected outages how will i send pagerduty triggering emails if my network connection or mail servers fails you should use an external ping service such as basicstate or wormly to monitor your network connection and mail server of course you can forward the error messages from these monitoring services to one of your pagerduty services this way if your site loses network connectivity or your mail server crashes the oncall engineer will be immediately notified by pagerduty how much does pagerduty cost you can find our price schedule here all new pagerduty accounts come with fullyfeatured riskfree  day trial no credit card required during the free trial you’ll be able to
