achieve the look you want its important to be aware of what a lights specifications say about its output learning how to light a room with led lights depends on more than brightness and lumens do you want to create a relaxed environment one thats lively and bright or one thats romantic any look is possible with the right led lights theyre available in a variety of intensities color temperatures shades and with different beam angles dimming capabilities and colorrendering indexes cri lumens lumens are a measurement of the amount of light produced by a source the higher the lumen count the brighter the light source lumens are often the deciding factor when it comes to purchasing new led light bulbs or fixtures theyre a more reliable metric to use than choosing a light based on its wattage an led light with an output thats comparable to a watt incandescent bulb might only consume  watts of power kitchens bathrooms laundry rooms and closets are areas where high lumen counts would be beneficial but brightness as with any other lighting choice is entirely up to you and the look you want for your room led bulbs are available in many intensities but those intensities often depend on the lights color temperature—otherwise known as the shade of white light being emitted correlated color temperature cct cct indicates the hue and tone of white light emitted from a specific bulb or fixture its measured in kelvins k which is similar to degrees in celsius different temperatures on the kelvin scale represent different colors for example light at kk looks more orangeyellow and is called ultra warm or warm white and as temperature increases in kelvins color changes to more of a “paper white” known as natural or neutral white between k and k and finally into a bluishwhite known as cool white k as a light sources color temperature increases brightness often increases while shopping for led lights pay close attention to the color temperatures that are available for any one bulb or fixture choosing a warm white bulb with a color temperature around k might mean sacrificing some brightness whereas if you choose the natural white version its likely that it will have a higher output traditionally different rooms are associated with different tones for example living rooms and nurseries tend to have soft warm white light a warm white light source will highlight other warm colors in a room is least likely to show imperfections and appears less bright when compared to higher ccts in kitchens basements garages and other areas where tasks are completed its standard to have natural or even cool white bulbs or fixtures because of the crisp bright white light that they emit colorrendering index cri cri indicates how accurately a light source reveals the true colors of objects people clothing etc when compared to how colors are shown in incandescent light or daylight the closer a light’s cri is to  the cri of incandescent light or daylight the better the color rendition of objects under that light any room can benefit from highcri led lights theyre great for living room lighting as they will show paint and furniture colors accurately kitchens closets bathrooms dressing rooms and other areas where presentation appearance and depth of color are important can also benefit from highcri led lights accurate color rendering can be achieved with a highcri light strip can light globe bulb linear light or other highcri bulb or fixture lights with a cri of  or higher are considered to show colors most accurately the cri of an led light generally ranges from  to  nanometers in order to understand nanometers you must first understand the electromagnetic spectrum and wavelengths the electromagnetic spectrum is the entire range of invisible and visible light and a wavelength is the distance between peaks of light waves wavelengths are measured in nanometers which are simply units of length that indicate colors of light within the spectrum nanometers will tell you how red green yellow purple etc a light source really is these measurements start lower at ultraviolet and increase from green to blue yellow orange and then red the wavelength of a colored light can be found in the lights specifications table beam angle fixtures or bulbs that emit wide beams such as led panel lights or br led bulbs for can lights are great for areas that require a lot of light such as basements kitchens or living rooms narrow beam angles like those from can lights with led par bulbs or track lights with mr led bulbs are best for highlighting decor or small areas globe bulbs such as a or g led vanity bulbs have degree beam angles which means that they throw light in all directions globe bulbs are the perfect choice for centralized light fixtures beam angle or pattern is a measurement of the angles that are formed between a cone of light’s brightest point the center and the points on both sides of the center where the light’s intensity is  percent as bright a larger beam angle means a wider spread of light across an area and vice versa with small beam angles while it depends on the angle and individual retailers small beam patterns are often referred to as spot beams and larger angles usually anything above  degrees are considered flood beams dimmability dimmable led bulbs and fixtures allow you to adjust the lighting in any room to match

clearance led household bulbs how to light a room the specs that matter in order to set the tone of a room and achieve the look you want its important to be aware of what a lights specifications say about its output learning how to light a room with led lights depends on more than brightness and lumens do you want to create a relaxed environment one thats lively and bright or one thats romantic any look is possible with the right led lights theyre available in a variety of intensities color temperatures shades and with different beam angles dimming capabilities and colorrendering indexes cri lumens lumens are a measurement of the amount of light produced by a source the higher the lumen count the brighter the light source lumens are often the deciding factor when it comes to purchasing new led light bulbs or fixtures theyre a more reliable metric to use than choosing a light based on its wattage an led light with an output thats comparable to a watt incandescent bulb might only consume  watts of power kitchens bathrooms laundry rooms and closets are areas where high lumen counts would be beneficial but brightness as with any other lighting choice is entirely up to you and the look you want for your room led bulbs are available in many intensities but those intensities often depend on the lights color temperature—otherwise known as the shade of white light being emitted correlated color temperature cct cct indicates the hue and tone of white light emitted from a specific bulb or fixture its measured in kelvins k which is similar to degrees in celsius different temperatures on the kelvin scale represent different colors for example light at kk looks more orangeyellow and is called ultra warm or warm white and as temperature increases in kelvins color changes to more of a “paper white” known as natural or neutral white between k and k and finally into a bluishwhite known as cool white k as a light sources color temperature increases brightness often increases while shopping for led lights pay close attention to the color temperatures that are available for any one bulb or fixture choosing a warm white bulb with a color temperature around k might mean sacrificing some brightness whereas if you choose the natural white version its likely that it will have a higher output traditionally different rooms are associated with different tones for example living rooms and nurseries tend to have soft warm white light a warm white light source will highlight other warm colors in a room is least likely to show imperfections and appears less bright when compared to higher ccts in kitchens basements garages and other areas where tasks are completed its standard to have natural or even cool white bulbs or fixtures because of the crisp bright white light that they emit colorrendering index cri cri indicates how accurately a light source reveals the true colors of objects people clothing etc when compared to how colors are shown in incandescent light or daylight the closer a light’s cri is to  the cri of incandescent light or daylight the better the color rendition of objects under that light any room can benefit from highcri led lights theyre great for living room lighting as they will show paint and furniture colors accurately kitchens closets bathrooms dressing rooms and other areas where presentation appearance and depth of color are important can also benefit from highcri led lights accurate color rendering can be achieved with a highcri light strip can light globe bulb linear light or other highcri bulb or fixture lights with a cri of  or higher are considered to show colors most accurately the cri of an led light generally ranges from  to  nanometers in order to understand nanometers you must first understand the electromagnetic spectrum and wavelengths the electromagnetic spectrum is the entire range of invisible and visible light and a wavelength is the distance between peaks of light waves wavelengths are measured in nanometers which are simply units of length that indicate colors of light within the spectrum nanometers will tell you how red green yellow purple etc a light source really is these measurements start lower at ultraviolet and increase from green to blue yellow orange and then red the wavelength of a colored light can be found in the lights specifications table beam angle fixtures or bulbs that emit wide beams such as led panel lights or br led bulbs for can lights are great for areas that require a lot of light such as basements kitchens or living rooms narrow beam angles like those from can lights with led par bulbs or track lights with mr led bulbs are best for highlighting decor or small areas globe bulbs such as a or g led vanity bulbs have degree beam angles which means that they throw light in all directions globe bulbs are the perfect choice for centralized light fixtures beam angle or pattern is a measurement of the angles that are formed between a cone of light’s brightest point the center and the points on both sides of the center where the light’s intensity is  percent as bright a larger beam angle means a wider spread of light across an area and vice versa with small beam angles while it depends on the angle and individual retailers small beam patterns are often referred to as spot beams and larger angles usually anything above  degrees are considered flood beams dimmability dimmable led bulbs and fixtures allow you to adjust the lighting in any room to match its function during a particular time for example in a living room or theater room you might want low light for watching tv but high light output for a gathering of friends theyre also great for bathrooms where you need bright light to get ready but want dim lighting for relaxing in a bathtub dimmable chandelier bulbs for example can create the perfect atmosphere for a family dinner while also allowing enough light for the room to function as a work space for school

is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time
