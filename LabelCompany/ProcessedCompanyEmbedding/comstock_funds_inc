subject to change without notice why sell options  optionsellerscom  option selling portfolios for high net worth investors usintlfax  east jackson street • suite tampa fl officeoptionsellerscom why every high net worth investor should consider selling commodities options if you currently limit your asset mix to traditional investments even if you write stock options you’re missing out on what could be a powerful tool for growing and protecting your net worth …selling options was in my opinion and not without risk the single most productive approach i’d ever found to build equity in an account james cordier founder top  reasons why every high net worth investor should consider selling options  powerful and complete diversification enjoy the relief that comes from finally getting properly diversified by owning a portfolio that is uncorrelated to everything – including the commodities indexes you’ll no longer have to rely so heavily on the direction of the stock market for growing wealth for you and your heirs read moreclose discover real diversification a commodity option selling portfolio offers a true diversifier – a freedom that is rare in the financial markets option selling can be the key to the chains that bind you to your overweighted stock portfolio now you may argue that either a i already own commodities in my portfolio… or b commodities sometimes track the stock market – they’re not that diversified both of these statements could be true and they would also both be irrelevant for a commodities option selling portfolio can be totally uncorrolated to anything else even the commodity indexes themselves why two reasons because commodities markets are much less correlated to each other than are stocks for instance if you buy shares of exxon apple and caterpillar and the dow tanks chances are your share values are all going down regardless of how “good” they are the are all stocks and there are many macroeconomic factors that affect all stock prices to commodity traders “stocks” are simply one of many futures contracts on the other hand if you own contracts of natural gas silver and soybeans those are three widely different products with very different fundamentals that affect their price the price of one has little to do with the price of the other that gives you broad diversification but that’s not the biggest reason because as an option seller you can sell puts andor calls that means that in addition to having positions in a variety of unrelated markets you can be long short or neutral – or all at the same time as an option seller you often don’t care what way the market is moving on a net basis your only concern is that it does not move sharply against your position in a short period of time a macro economic event that tanks stocks or moves commodities indexes can be good bad or neutral to your position as an option seller an oil shock can have little effect on your position in coffee make sense  potential for outsize growth andor income option selling portfolios can produce  even  returns over the longer term making them a potentially high octane tool for wealth generation read moreclose the potential for outsized returns if you are purely seeking an investment with some horsepower this could be reason  for you for while option selling can be “slow and boring” for the action oriented trader the accumulated premiums and leverage of the futures markets can make them anything but stock option sellers take note this ain’t selling covered calls on your microsoft this is option selling on steroids if you sell a stock option and take a  premium you are generally paying  to  times that amount in margin to hold that position in commodities options you can sell options for a much higher premiums we target  to  each b much lower margins generally  ½ to  times the premium thus a margin for a  option premium may only require a  to  margin requirement from you we’ll let you do the math suffice to say if you get satisfaction from targeting potentially high roi on your investments and are comfortable with a certain degree of risk option selling on commodities could be a good choice for you using commodities leverage to your advantage is covered thoroughly in our book the complete guide to option selling rd edition on sale in fine bookstores or here now  the ability to be profitable in nearly any kind of market economic or interest rate environment read moreclose can be effective in nearly any kind of market a major benefit of option selling and one that makes if a favorite of the high net worth crowd is that it can be effective in nearly any kind of market conditions as covered above this is especially true in commodities where individual markets tend to move somewhat independently of each other if you have a big chunk of your cash in stocks it’s all good until you hit a market correction a wave of volatility on some economic or geopolitical event or an outright bear market as an option seller especially a commodities option seller you have the ability to be successful in these kinds of marketsoption writing can be profitable in bull bear or listless markets market volatility great volatile markets are the best markets in which to be an option writer it was buffet who said to be greedy when others are fearful while your golf buddies are complaining about the “rough waters” the market is in you can potentially be sailing in a cool breeze remember you’re deep out of the money – way over or way under the market while this doesn’t make you bulletproof to all market events it does give you a great deal of flexibility and diversity to deal with what may come along the end result for you is the peace of mindof knowing your portfolio has the potential to produce no matter what is happening in the financial markets  consistency of trading with the odds now on your side tired of always hearing about wall street insiders and hedge fund managers having the drop on individual investors selling options lets you level the playing field read moreclose trading with the odds this is one of the biggest advantages of selling options as alan greenspan once said “amateurs want to be right professionals want to make money” option sellers don’t have to be right to make money in option selling you give up your chance to hit “home runs” in exchange for the consistency of hitting “singles” – over and over and over again it is estimated that  of all options held at expiration will expire worthless by using a few simple tools – you can select options with even higher odds than this of expiring worthless if buying options is like going to the casino selling options is like being the casino where the odds are tilted in your favor a black jack dealer in vegas only has a tiny edge over any particular player at his table yet if players sit there long enough the dealer will eventually get all of their money this exemplifies the power of using applied odds over time the fact of the matter is you can choose options with a   even  chance of expiring worthless when is the last time you got those kinds of odds buying a stock while risk of loss is always present as an option seller you gain the confidence of knowing you are now trading with the percentages “the strategy of selling options is at its core a strategy of using applied odds over time” the  figure rightly grabs people’s attention chat room “option geniuses” may argue this figure’s relevance but few will argue an option sellers advantage over an option buyer the fact that most investors don’t know how to harness these odds is not your problem let it be theirs this consistency – having the majority of your trades as winners instead of losers can be not only psychologically beneficial to you the trader but give you more focus to act when there is a risk measure to be employed or a new opportunity to capture  time is now your powerful ally investing is fraught with uncertainties but there is no greater certainty than the passage of time as an option seller time is your greatest ally ticking away at the value of your option as each day passes read moreclose time is on your side when selling or writing an option time value works for you instead of against you that means that whatever else is going on in the underlying market you enjoy the comfort of knowing that the unwavering hands of father time are always working in your favor when you sell an option the buyer of the option pays you a premium for that option if you sell an out of the money option the entire value of that option is in time value as time passes all other things remaining constant the option will gradually lose its value this is called time decay and it’s one of the main reasons selling options can be so effective it is for this reason that optionsellerscom pursues a strategy of selling deep out of the money options in client portfolios the closer an option gets to expiration the faster its rate of time decay the graph above illustrates the principle of time decay and its acceleration as expiration draws near an option is considered a “wasting asset” time value erodes as each day passes accelerating as the option’s expiration nears this is referred to as timedecay if the underlying contract’s price does not move to the option’s strike price by expiration the option will have no value left and expire worthless and the option seller will keep the premium of course as in any trading a large move in the underlying may result in a loss this is the concept on which our entire portfolio strategy is based notice that the value decays the fastest during the last  days of the option’s life  every trade has an expiration date whether you own a stock a piece of real estate or even a commodities futures contract one of the toughest decisions you’ll ever have to make is where to take profits on a successful trade avoiding that gutwrenching decision is a big benefit enjoyed by the option seller read moreclose no profit taking decisions you have a profit on your trade now what do you take the money off the table now and risk that your about to miss out on an even bigger move or do you “let it ride” and risk the profit you’ve already made one of the hardest parts of futures or any trading is deciding when to take profits with option selling if the market behaves favorably towards your position you are relieved from the responsibility of making this decision as time value decays your option the market will gradually take profits for you upon expiration if the option is still out of the money has not reached your strike price the entire premium for which you sold the option will be in your account at this time your position automatically closes out however you reserve the right to close out your short option position at any time prior to expiration as well – either as a loss limiting measure or as a profit taking move it’s a personal choice in regard to taking a profit some of the investors we’ve worked with find that it can be easier and require less effort to simply let the market “do it for them” of course no “safe” trading system has ever been devised and no one can guarantee profits or freedom from loss  ease of low maintenence unlike a stock option selling account if you sell options in the manner described on this website you won’t need to be by a computer screen all day read moreclose low maintenance account deep out of the money options tend to move slowly and do not require minute by minute maintenance that being said this isn’t a sell it and forget it strategy either your positions will need some adjustments from time to time many high net worth investors choose to remove themselves from the trading equation entirely instead hiring a professional to handle the day to day trading and position management for them now that’s low maintenance  security of investing in hard commodities commodities unlike stocks will always have a value read moreclose investing in real products that will always hold value – not a piece of paper  may seem like a long time ago but investors that watched their net worth melt away through that market collapse took a key lesson away from it – at the end of the day shares of stock are merely a piece of paper if you really want to drive that lesson home look up a little blip in the stock market that took place in  we all remember  remember lehman brothers or bear stearns how about enron on the days and weeks any of those events occurred when companies and paper became worthless or perceived to be worthless people still woke up and ate their corn flakes and drank their orange juice they still put gasoline in their cars and drove to work where they drank their coffee and ate their chocolate doughnut made with wheat sugar and cocoa and to comfort themselves they went home to their nice warm natural gas heated home got out a pound of ground beef raised on usda approved soybean meal for dinner and retired to their den here they retrieved their gold and silver coins they had hidden in the safe and counted them to comfort themselves in the moment why because they had value and they feared when they turned on their computer screen tomorrow all of that paper they had their money in would not “sugar can’t go bankrupt soybeans can’t go out of business” does this mean the commodities are always a better investment than stocks not at all one is not necessarily superior to the other are we suggesting that stocks are more dangerous or “risky” than commodities of course not what it does mean is that no matter what goes on in the world commodities such as the ones listed above will always have some kind of demand and where there is demand there will always be value it may not always be the same value but a value nonetheless a pound of sugar will always be worth something to someone same for a barrel of oil or a bushel of wheat as a high net worth investor you are likely already aware of the crucial practice of diversifying your assets with commodities you gain an extra feeling of security in knowing you have a component of your assets in investments you can hold in your hand –a lump of silver a gallon of gas a bushel of corn – things you can touch feel use no matter what happens in the world it remains likely that americans are still going to want breakfast in the morning and dinner at night fill up the gas tank stay warm or cool and feel “safe” with some precious metal in the closet the same cannot be said for pieces of paper that have names like “enron” or “lehman” printed on them “sugar can’t go bankrupt soybeans can’t go out of business commodities will always have a value”  relax you don’t have to try to predict the future anymore read moreclose no more trying to guess market direction no matter what they say nobody knows what any market is going to do especially on a shortterm basis however do enough homework and it is sometimes possible to make a fairly accurate projection of where prices will not go on a longer term basis by selling deep out of the money options you avoid the game of trying to predict where prices will go today tomorrow or next week instead you are only projecting where you think prices won’t go for instance if you are bullish the natural gas market you might sell a deep out of the money put option in this case the market can move up stay the same or even move down as long as it is above your strike price upon expiration you will still take your full profit as an option seller you accept the fact that you cannot predict the future you free yourself from the “need” for the market to move in a particular direction you are satisfied to simply “bet” against the unlikely events and then take a payment for your efforts – over and over again while there is still risk in this strategy you have the ability to profit regardless of which direction the market is moving or even if it does not move at all and you relieve yourself of the stress that comes from trying to accomplish the nearly impossible at the same time you’ll also free yourself from the requirement of having perfect timing when buying a stock or futures contract when you enter your position is just as important as what you are buying in selling deep out of the money options the option values typically aren’t moving as quickly as the underlying stock or commodity the fact that they are deep out of the money can mean that daily fluctuations in the underlying market may not have a large impact on the price of the option thus your timing becomes less important although all futures trading carries some degree of risk done correctly option selling can place your position in the market far enough away that short term swings in the market may not dramatically affect your position this not only gives you staying power but allows you to focus on longer term market fundamentals relief from this decision means lower stress for you “avoid the game of trying to predict where prices will go today tomorrow or next week the purpose of analyzing a market now simply becomes a practice of picking a far away point where it won’t go”  efficiency in keeping more of what you earn option selling is a taxfriendly strategy read moreclose  the option sellers tax advantage if you think you pay your “fair share” and then some commodity option selling could be the right strategy for you profits on option selling are taxed on the “” rule –  as short term capital gains but  at the same rate as dividends this makes them a favorable investment for those in high tax brackets in addition your end of year taxes on your commodity option selling account are surprisingly simple you get a straight  profitloss statement and you pay your taxes based on that one figure no more reconciling each and every trade for the yearthis aspect makes the investment both simple to account for and tax efficient the downside of option selling there is of course no perfect investment like any other form of wealth generation option selling has its risks and drawbacks the two main ones are these it can be slow and boring if you’re into active trading and the daily action of the markets – selling options in the manner prescribed here is not for you sure there will be days where some sort of activity is required however for the most part selling deep out of the money commodities options holds all of the excitement of watching paint dry – at least over the short term fat tail risk there is of course risk in selling options – even deep out of the money options while the risk of your options ever going in the money using the method we prescribe is remote your primary risk is that of the value of your option increasing usually the result of a sudden and sharp move in the underlying combined with a surge in volatility that is why experienced and diligent risk management is so critical to your performance contrary to popular belief there are a few simple yet highly effective methods of managing risk when selling options that being said in my  years of professional trading experience selling options is in my opinion and not without risk the single most productive approach i’ve ever found to growing long term equity in an account if you are an intelligent rational high net worth individual who is looking for an investment approach that targets high returns with reasonable risks has relatively high odds of success on each individual trade

large degree and in ireland anyways seems to have come first maybe you could explain this also i have to say that even though i think you are right and will be proven so soon enough you tend to underestimate having read your column for ten years now i think you underestimate by a  years the reflationary power of central banks and for how long they can keep them up for more cycle of deflation theoryim sure that other regular readers of your commentary have noticed the term beggarthyneighbor showing up more and more in the press and online it seems to validate the cycle of deflation theory

equities general stock market strategy interest rates and real estate as well as long term macroeconomic themes centering on the interaction of inflation debt interest rates economic growth and their effects on the stock bond commodity and currency markets comstock partners started implementing these strategies when they began managing the dreyfus capital value fund presently the comstock partners capital value fund in  and launched the comstock partners strategy fund in  in may of  the shareholders of comstock funds voted to join the gabelli family of mutual funds investment style comstock partners inc analyzes economic and financial conditions from a longterm macroeconomic perspective and makes adjustments based on cyclical and shorterterm considerations in pursuit of its goals the firm invests in various asset classes including domestic and foreign stocks bonds currencies and derivatives including indices and options for the capital value fund comstock partners can buy or sell short and make use of leverage in order to maximize returns under various market conditions in effect we believe our operation resembles a modernday hedge fund in its scope of activities for each of its asset classes comstock adheres to macroeconomic themes while also utilizing a disciplined investment philosophy that attempts to remove the emotional element of investing by focusing on data that in the past has exhibited a correlation with an asset’s future price movement such data may be fundamental or technical and includes indicators relating to the economy money and credit valuation price momentum and investor sentiment while each of these indicators may provide some degree of insight into the future performance of a particular investment comstock believes that an appropriate combination of these tools provides the highest probability of accurate market timing and security selection investing of course inherently involves subjective judgements and there can be no assurance that comstock’s investment approach will prove successful         printer friendly format    send to a friend last updated on   send to a friend      send us feedback    add to favorites     comstock

in depositary receipts involves the same risks as direct investments in foreign securities in addition the underlying issuers of certain depositary receipts are under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications or pass through any voting rights with respect to the deposited securities to the holders of such receipts the fund may therefore receive less timely information or have less control than if it invested directly in the foreign issuer derivatives risk the value of a derivative instrument depends largely on and is derived from the value of an underlying security currency commodity interest rate index or other asset each referred to as an underlying asset in addition to risks relating to the underlying assets the use of derivatives may include other possibly greater risks including counterparty leverage and liquidity risks counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative as a result an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative which may make the fund’s returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price this risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions during which the fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions derivatives may also be harder to value less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the fund’s ability to use certain derivatives or their cost also derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits particularly during adverse market conditions emerging markets securities risk emerging markets also referred to as developing markets are generally subject to greater market volatility political social and economic instability uncertain trading markets and more governmental limitations on foreign investment than more developed markets in addition companies operating in emerging markets may be subject to lower trading volume and greater price fluctuations than companies in more developed markets securities law and the enforcement of systems of taxation in many emerging market countries may change quickly and unpredictably in addition investments in emerging markets securities may also be subject to additional transaction costs delays in settlement procedures and lack of timely information foreign securities risk the fund’s foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability changes in economic or taxation policies difficulty in enforcing obligations decreased liquidity or increased volatility foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits in which the fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls unless the fund has hedged its foreign securities risk foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency or other instruments through which the fund has exposure to foreign currencies to decline in value currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time currency hedging strategies if used are not always successful management risk the fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the adviser’s judgment about markets interest rates or the attractiveness relative values liquidity or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the fund’s portfolio the fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect additionally legislative regulatory or tax developments may adversely affect management of the fund and therefore the ability of the fund to achieve its investment objective market risk the market values of the fund’s investments and therefore the value of the fund’s shares will go up and down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably market risk may affect a single issuer industry or section of the economy or it may affect the market as a whole individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments such as bonds during a general downturn in the financial markets multiple asset classes may decline in value when markets perform well there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the fund will rise in value reit riskreal estate risk investments in real estate related instruments may be affected by economic legal cultural environmental or technological factors that affect property values rents or occupancies of real estate related to the fund’s holdings shares of real estate related companies which tend to be small and midcap companies may be more volatile and less liquid sector focus risk the fund may from time to time invest a significant amount of its assets ie over  in one market sector or group of related industries in this event the fund’s performance will depend to a greater extent on the overall condition of the sector or group of industries and there is increased risk that the fund will lose significant value if conditions adversely affect that sector or group of industries small and midcapitalization risks small and midcapitalization companies tend to be more vulnerable to changing market conditions may have little or no operating history or track record of success and may have more limited product lines and markets less experienced management and fewer financial resources than larger companies these companies securities may be more volatile and less liquid than those of more established companies and their returns may vary sometimes significantly from the overall securities market value investing style risk a value investing style subjects the fund to the risk that the valuations never improve or that the returns on value equity securities are less than returns on other styles of investing or the

be comingand asset bubbles caused by central banks may burst  am the wall street journal recently published an article by greg ip entitled “why soaring assets and low unemployment mean it’s time to start worrying”  while mr ip stops short of predicting a recession or its timing he details a list of preconditions for recession all which exist now these include a labor market at full strength frothy asset prices tightening by central banks and a pervasive sense of calm as illustrated by the very low levels of the vix index  at the same time the fed led by janet yellen continues the narrative that they will normalize interest rates while slowly reducing the fed balance sheet   this follows what we believe was an insane monetary experiment beginning with the bursting of the “housing bubble” in  and lasting until the present day  the fed would have you believe that its policies after helping the economy avoid an outright collapse have helped the economy grow at a moderate rate with low inflation  in our view the word moderate is a gross overstatement  we think the better description is “anemic” because no recovery since the great depression has been as slow as this one even though it’s the second longest in the country’s history as the situation now stands the trailing  month ttm pe ratio of the sp  based on gaap generally accepted accounting principles earnings stands at just over x which is among the most expensive in history  a casual observer might think therefore that a ttm pe of x means that the stock market is expecting growth to accelerate  after all there is no shortage of television commentators and portfolio managers that think we are on the path to an accelerating economy  all one needs to do is tune into any of the financial news networks to confirm that observation we do not agree with that assessment and to no surprise neither does the bond market  one of the most telling indicators of what the bond market “sees” as prospects for economic growth is the spread between  year and  year us government bonds  the steeper the slope of the yield curve the more the bond market sees growth and vice versa  so for the month ending  the  year to  year spread closed at  basis points  to find a lower monthly close for that series one has to go all the way back to december of  just as the effects of the bursting of the “housing bubble” were hitting with full force  so while the stock market “sees” prospects for growth as strong as evidenced by the x ttm pe the bond market is just the opposite  not only is the yield curve relatively flat but the absolute level of bond yields are also very low  it should be also noted that an inversion in the yield curve should that occur would be a clear alarm bell as it pertains to the possibility of a recession  in the past on the  occasions when the yield curve has been this flat according to mr ip it went on to invert on  of those occasions in our view the fed european central bank ecb and bank of japan boj all recognize that the main result of the massive money printing and the low to negative interest rates of the last several years have done little more than increase the value of financial assets rather than generating solid economic growth  we and others have said as much for quite some time now  we also believe the central banks are “between a rock and a hard place”  they realize the need to not burst the “bubble” but on the other hand they do not want to negatively affect the already anemic economic growth rates of their respective economies  so the fed continues on the path to “normalization” speaking of one more rate increase this year and three each in  and   we agree with the fed funds market which is calling the fed’s bluff  the futures market on fed funds is priced for one increase this year and only one each in the next two  the fed is of course fully aware of the fact that of the thirteen tightening cycles since the great depression ten of those were followed by recession   so the odds are not good as we see them  we think the bond market will prove to be right and the stock market will prove to be wrong  as we have written in the past the economy is swimming against a stream of rising debt unfunded federal state and local liabilities low productivity growth and negative labor force demographics  at the same time the booming stock market has been partially fueled both by stock buybacks that strip equity from shareholders as in the money stock options are exercised by corporate managements and “yield chasing” by return starved investors around the world  whether the fed tightens aggressivelyor not remains to be seen  but in our view the damage has already been done by its policies and those of the other major central banks  years of artificially low interest rates have resulted in mal investment and asset bubbles when the market does start down in earnest our view is that the move will be large and rapid  we believe it will then take considerable time as in years for the stock market to get back to highs that were achieved courtesy of the central bank bubble  valuation will matterit always does  pm as the us stock market continues to make new alltime highs it may appear to many investors that valuations no longer matter  we do not see it that way now nor have we ever in the past   we maintain our long held belief that the us stock market is extremely overpriced relative to past earnings and future earnings prospects   this overpricing is the direct result of the largest financial experiment in history ie the growth in the fed’s balance sheet from bn to tn and the setting of the overnight fed funds rate to near zero from december of  to december of   today eighteen months after the first rate increase in seven years the daily effective fed funds rate typically comes in at a mere  bps  we have repeatedly referred to this period as the “central bank bubble” as asset values have inflated by growing its balance sheet and keeping interest rates low the fed reasoned asset prices would be backstopped and stimulated  the increase in asset prices would create a “wealth effect” as those in our society fortunate enough to own these assets would feel wealthier and spend money  this in turn would result in economic growth that would benefit society as a whole including those at the bottom end of the economic ladder  the result has not been what the fed intended and in fact has caused some unintended consequences  the economy has grown at the most anemic rate ever around  per year when recovering from any recession  wealth disparity in our society is at an alltime high  at the same time by many different valuation metrics the stock market is near or in excess of the highest valuations in history  as of this writing the trailing  month pe based on generally accepted accounting principles gaap is approximately  a historically very high number when the economy is not in a recession and earnings have already dropped more than prices we believe that in the long run corporate earnings should grow about as fast as the economy  the stock market in our view is imputing a higher growth rate to future earnings than we think is likely or even possible for the following reasons we believe that the debt outstanding in the us which consists of federal state local corporate household and student loans has been a major factor in the anemic growth of the past several years  this number currently stands at tn or about  of gdp   the servicing of this debt diverts resources from otherwise productive uses  in addition given the artificially low level of interest rates the exposure to rising rates is enormous and a major risk that is not in our view universally appreciated  there is also the nontrivial matter of the unwinding of the fed’s balance sheet  selling bonds in the market does not appear to be a consideration as that could cause a stampede out of fixed income markets here and around the world  we would like to point out that the “running off” of the balance sheet letting bonds mature is another “experiment”  in addition estimates of the size of the us government’s unfunded liabilities and entitlements range from tn to tn and that is not even in the above numbers  more on this belowthe ecb boj and boe have also adopted “whatever it takes” policies  they too have greatly expanded their balance sheets and have even “upped the ante” with previously unheard of negative interest rate policies  because of the liquidity of currency spot and forward markets much of that money has come into the us to “chase yield”  this has further inflated and distorted asset prices in the us  also the world’s second largest economy china has inflated a credit bubble with breathtaking speed that relative to its banking system is the largest in the world  all of this further adds fuel to the worldwide credit bubble firethe growth rate in gdp is a function of the change in total hours worked and the output per hour  with the economy at or near full employment there is not much room for growth in the total hours worked  in addition we are now at the point that the “baby boomers” are retiring at the rate of about  people per day while new workers entering the work force number much less than that  immigration of skilled workers could potentially help the problem but thus far we see no rush on the part of the trump administration to address this meaningfullyon the productivity side the alarm was recently sounded by former fed chairman greenspan  he contends that the growth in entitlements has crowded out savings which in turn means less capital flowing into productive assets  he calls entitlement reform the third rail of us politics as our leaders are afraid to confront the problem head on for fear of being voted out  we completely agree  thus given the level of debt and commensurate interest rate exposure along with negative population demographics and the lack of addressing entitlement reform as it relates to long term productivity growth it is our strong belief that the us economy will not grow at rates that will vindicate current equity market valuations  we remain committed to the thesis that the experimental fed policies of the past years have inflated and distorted equity and other asset prices tremendously while generating “unintended consequences” in our view this time is not different  ultimately the stock market will reflect an economic reality much different than it does currently  when that happens as in past times when bull markets ended stocks will likely fall much faster than they went up   how does gross domestic product growpopulation demographics will work against president trumps plan  am a major variable in the determination of gdp gross domestic product is the growth of the labor force  what a nation produces can be thought of in simple terms as the number of hours worked multiplied by the output per hour productivity  it is a documented fact that the growth rate of the us labor force is declining and is expected by the us bureau of labor statistics to only increase by  per year over the coming decade  this is slower than it has grown in past decades and is due to a combination of many demographic factors including the relative aging of the population president trump and members of his cabinet have stated that once his agenda items are signed into law the country will be on its way to  growth  as our viewers know we have written many times on the anemic sub  economic growth of the obama years  president trump intends to reverse the trend of lower growth by  repealing and replacing the aca affordable care act which has thus far been rejected    shrinking regulations including dodd frank  lower taxes for individuals and corporations both large and small  repatriation of  tn to  tn of corporate cash residing abroad  implementing a national infrastructure rebuilding plan that will replace many roads bridges airports and other major items in desperate need of repair what president trump left out of these  “agenda” items is the fact that the only way to double the growth in gdp is to increase population enough that more people enter the labor force   the increase in the labor force should also coincide with an increase in productivity anything that president trump does that inhibits growth of the part of the population that could become part of the labor force such as curbing legal immigration will have a negative effect on the increase in growth that he seeks to achieve please understand that president trump is expressing his position of doubling the growth rate of gdp with us population demographics as a major road block  due to the aging of the “baby boomers”  potential labor force participants are retiring every day  according to the bureau of the census about  people are added to the us population daily  that is the net difference between births deaths and immigration  this is hardly the situation that took place in the mid ’s ’s and ’s when “baby boomers” entered the workforce in great numbers and the economy grew rapidly as a result  thus presidents reagan gwh bush and clinton had relatively great economies in their presidential years from a growth standpoint  president trump needs to understand that the population demographics are working against him as never before with fewer and fewer people entering the workforce  policies that he and his cabinet espouse need to reflect the fact that our economy needs more not less workers  those workers should be as highly skilled as possible so that the productivity side of the equation is also a tailwind  debt can be looked upon in various wayswhat is the real total debt in the usa  am  comstock has been discussing the debt situation in our country for years  we wrote a “special report” discussing the various forms of debt and explained how the debt is incorporated in “the cycle of deflation” see attachment as the debt was hindering many speculators and investors just before the dotcom bubble was about ready to collapse  we warned that the debt was the main reason that the valuations were the highest in history and would eventually break the market  this was exactly what took place starting in march of  when the stock market crashed and a severe recession began  we again warned our viewers about the problems of excessive debt during the housing bubble of  to  when alan greenspan the chairman of the federal reserve at the time decided to lower interest rates to  in june of   this caused the largest housing mania of all time  banks were virtually pushing money to anyone that wanted a loan to buy a house whether they could afford it or not  back thenthey called these loans “no doc loans”  these were loans that were made without any documentation whatsoever the amazing part of this era was that greenspan warned stock investors about the “irrational exuberance” that was taking place in the late s as the stock market rose almost every day the “irrational exuberance” speech drove the market down but that only scared off investors for just a few days and the stock investors regained the losses almost immediately  after observing the voracity of the market that could not be held down greenspan changed his mind and confessed to being wrong about his warnings just before the real break took place in early   he also witnessed the housing bubble and not only did he support the banks making the loans but actually encouraged the banks to continue making these insane loans  this leads us to the old time phrase “fool us one time shame on you fool us twice shame on us”  when the current debt bubble breaks and the stock market collapses we could say “fool us  times and we should be banned from trading and investing in the financial markets”  unless we can understand why the debt caused the collapse in  after the roaring ’s in  and  we should be forced to compare the debt to gdp in all of these times to the present if you were forced to do this you would look at the debt and be shocked at how much the debt grew over the past two decades  if you are a democrat you might compare how much the debt grew under president george w bush and use examples of how much it grew during the eight years of his administration you could make comparisons like the debt grew more under george w than all past presidents going back to george washington  if you are a republican you could make the same comparisons of how much the debt grew under barack obama and make the same comparisons going back again to george washington  if you did make these comparisons you would come close to going out of your mind because it would have to scare you  the amazing thing is the fact that you would be making the comparisons erroneously since you would look at the debt doubling under george w and then doubled again under barack obama and think we are in real trouble  however the debt you would be using is strictly the government debt and get scared as hell when you see the debt is now just about equal to the gdp of the greatest country in the world at about  trillion apiece  if on the other hand you were looking deeper into the debt and could see that the debt has grown much more than the gdp of our country  in fact the real debt relative to gdp is actually about  of gdp if you include the government debt the state and local debt student debt credit market debt and the loans made to foreign banks overseas  the  of debt relative to gdp also should include all of the entitlements and other off balance sheet debt that we include now  these are obligations that have been guaranteed to most of the people in this country such as the entitlement promises of social security medicare medicaid and government employee pensions  if you take all of them into consideration the debt to gdp would not be just  but closer to another  trillion of debt which would take the total debt to over  of our gdp  if that doesn’t scare you nothing will now that president donald trump will probably have as much trouble with his other agenda items as he did with his repeal and replace of healthcare the market could have real problems  and when this enormous debt comes to light we would expect the market to decline sharply  the only way that the trump administration can survive without moving his agenda quickly this year would be to grow the economy close to the rate of  to   as he predicted  but it is very hard to grow nearly that fast with these demographics retiring baby boomers fewer immigrantsit is impossible to get corporations to make capital expenditures and productivity to increase without being able to increase the labor force this is why they are in such a bind the stock market is priced for perfectionbut politics debt and stagflation may change things  am the trump rally which began during the overnight session the night of november th has in our view built perfection into prices which we think were already priced to near perfection  in the bull case fundamentals were already improving and president trump’s proposed cutting of regulations taxes and instituting progrowth fiscal spending just adds fuel to the fire  it seems to us that every possible benefit of the doubt is being given to the new administration in an economic and political climate that is unprecedented in our lifetime and possibly our country’s history in addition there is nothing that says that president trump will get all he wants from congress  the most positive outcome is being discounted by the stock market presently and if there is resistance or delay with his programs the stock market will suffer the us will need to raise the debt ceiling in midmarch and we do not believe the market has focused on that  with debt and interest rate exposure that are enormous we do not believe that republican deficit hawks that have spent their careers as such will be so eager to approve spending increases that are not offset by spending cuts    additionally we expect democratic opposition to the president’s agenda to be fierce  so the trump programs which have been treated by the market as a forgone conclusion will in our view be much more difficult the fed continues to state that three rate increases are on the table for   our view of the matter is that the fed is walking a tightrope as the tn of us debt is relatively short in duration with a maturity of just over  years and just under a  average coupon  thus there is enormous interest rate exposure in terms of the debt and deficit for that reason alone it is likely the fed will be behind the curve  the exposure created by the tn of debt and possibly much more debt under president trump along with tn in unfunded liabilities and entitlements puts the us and the fed in a very serious bind as each  increase in funding cost to the government will add bn to the national debt  additionally as labor markets tighten with corresponding negative effects on profit margins the fed moving gingerly risks an acceleration in inflation as our readers know we are believers that high debt is in and of itself a dampening factor on economic growth  we have also written many times about how the  years of close to zero interest rates has caused risk assets to be mispriced  the european central bank ecb and bank of japan boj mimicked us and even upped the ante with negative rates   and the boj purchases of equities has further inflated the bubble in japan  the newest economic superpower china is in a credit bubble of its own that is even larger than ours as a percentage of its economy  while president trump has referred to china as a currency manipulator they are doing exactly the opposite  a weak currency will only exacerbate an already serious capital flight problem  therefore they have been trying to strengthen the yuan there is an argument being made currently by alan greenspan that we are headed from “stagnation to stagflation”  in the beginning of this cycle profit margins and the stock market should move up as inflation gains momentum  but it will not continue because what is really going on longer term is a problem with the productivity of the economy  as our country ages and retires we will not have an influx of baby boomers entering the workforce like we had in the ’s and ’s these population demographics cause a problem with growth in entitlements  the entitlements crowd out savings which results in less investment in productive assets  we subscribe to this argument and strongly believe this to be a headwind to growth that will exist unless we get many more workers entering the labor force  more working immigrants entering the country would ease the situation but would bring its own additional set of problems  on the subject of valuation our favorite measure is the trailing twelve month generally accepted accounting principles gaap pe of the sp   with  of sp companies reporting as of  it appears the trailing twelve month gaap earnings are just under   that’s a current pe of  we don’t believe that a  growth environment justifies that valuation   furthermore analyst’s estimates compiled by sp project that earnings growth in the next two years will be just under  a year  this is in an economy which has not been able to get above  annual growth and stay there  even if earnings did grow at that rate the gaap pe in  years at this level of the market would still be around  which is historically expensive  if the economy and earnings are growing at that rate one would have to think that interest rates and inflation will rise  and if gaap earnings are capitalized at significantly higher interest rates it will naturally be a problem for stocks in summary it is our view that the market is in the third credit driven bubble of this century  we believe that the strong move since the election has more to do with hopes and dreams of what could happen rather than the reality of what is likely to happen  the additional growth that could come as a result of less regulation and lower taxes pales beside the inflation in asset values especially stocks due to the policies of the fed  in that sense it doesn’t actually matter all that much who the president is debt and demographics are working against us and it will take in our view a bear market of epic proportions to correct the excesses in valuation that exist    send to a friend      send us feedback    add to

why sell options  optionsellerscom  option selling portfolios for high net worth investors usintlfax  east jackson street • suite tampa fl officeoptionsellerscom why every high net worth investor should consider selling commodities options if you currently limit your asset mix to traditional investments even if you write stock options you’re missing out on what could be a powerful tool for growing and protecting your net worth …selling options was in my opinion and not without risk the single most productive approach i’d ever found to build equity in an account james cordier founder top  reasons why every high net worth investor should consider selling options  powerful and complete diversification enjoy the relief that comes from finally getting properly diversified by owning a portfolio that is uncorrelated to everything – including the commodities indexes you’ll no longer have to rely so heavily on the direction of the stock market for growing wealth for you and your heirs read moreclose discover real diversification a commodity option selling portfolio offers a true diversifier – a freedom that is rare in the financial markets option selling can be the key to the chains that bind you to your overweighted stock portfolio now you may argue that either a i already own commodities in my portfolio… or b commodities sometimes track the stock market – they’re not that diversified both of these statements could be true and they would also both be irrelevant for a commodities option selling portfolio can be totally uncorrolated to anything else even the commodity indexes themselves why two reasons because commodities markets are much less correlated to each other than are stocks for instance if you buy shares of exxon apple and caterpillar and the dow tanks chances are your share values are all going down regardless of how “good” they are the are all stocks and there are many macroeconomic factors that affect all stock prices to commodity traders “stocks” are simply one of many futures contracts on the other hand if you own contracts of natural gas silver and soybeans those are three widely different products with very different fundamentals that affect their price the price of one has little to do with the price of the other that gives you broad diversification but that’s not the biggest reason because as an option seller you can sell puts andor calls that means that in addition to having positions in a variety of unrelated markets you can be long short or neutral – or all at the same time as an option seller you often don’t care what way the market is moving on a net basis your only concern is that it does not move sharply against your position in a short period of time a macro economic event that tanks stocks or moves commodities indexes can be good bad or neutral to your position as an option seller an oil shock can have little effect on your position in coffee make sense  potential for outsize growth andor income option selling portfolios can produce  even  returns over the longer term making them a potentially high octane tool for wealth generation read moreclose the potential for outsized returns if you are purely seeking an investment with some horsepower this could be reason  for you for while option selling can be “slow and boring” for the action oriented trader the accumulated premiums and leverage of the futures markets can make them anything but stock option sellers take note this ain’t selling covered calls on your microsoft this is option selling on steroids if you sell a stock option and take a  premium you are generally paying  to  times that amount in margin to hold that position in commodities options you can sell options for a much higher premiums we target  to  each b much lower margins generally  ½ to  times the premium thus a margin for a  option premium may only require a  to  margin requirement from you we’ll let you do the math suffice to say if you get satisfaction from targeting potentially high roi on your investments and are comfortable with a certain degree of risk option selling on commodities could be a good choice for you using commodities leverage to your advantage is covered thoroughly in our book the complete guide to option selling rd edition on sale in fine bookstores or here now  the ability to be profitable in nearly any kind of market economic or interest rate environment read moreclose can be effective in nearly any kind of market a major benefit of option selling and one that makes if a favorite of the high net worth crowd is that it can be effective in nearly any kind of market conditions as covered above this is especially true in commodities where individual markets tend to move somewhat independently of each other if you have a big chunk of your cash in stocks it’s all good until you hit a market correction a wave of volatility on some economic or geopolitical event or an outright bear market as an option seller especially a commodities option seller you have the ability to be successful in these kinds of marketsoption writing can be profitable in bull bear or listless markets market volatility great volatile markets are the best markets in which to be an option writer it was buffet who said to be greedy when others are fearful while your golf buddies are complaining about the “rough waters” the market is in you can potentially be sailing in a cool breeze remember you’re deep out of the money – way over or way under the market while this doesn’t make you bulletproof to all market events it does give you a great deal of flexibility and diversity to deal with what may come along the end result for you is the peace of mindof knowing your portfolio has the potential to produce no matter what is happening in the financial markets  consistency of trading with the odds now on your side tired of always hearing about wall street insiders and hedge fund managers having the drop on individual investors selling options lets you level the playing field read moreclose trading with the odds this is one of the biggest advantages of selling options as alan greenspan once said “amateurs want to be right professionals want to make money” option sellers don’t have to be right to make money in option selling you give up your chance to hit “home runs” in exchange for the consistency of hitting “singles” – over and over and over again it is estimated that  of all options held at expiration will expire worthless by using a few simple tools – you can select options with even higher odds than this of expiring worthless if buying options is like going to the casino selling options is like being the casino where the odds are tilted in your favor a black jack dealer in vegas only has a tiny edge over any particular player at his table yet if players sit there long enough the dealer will eventually get all of their money this exemplifies the power of using applied odds over time the fact of the matter is you can choose options with a   even  chance of expiring worthless when is the last time you got those kinds of odds buying a stock while risk of loss is always present as an option seller you gain the confidence of knowing you are now trading with the percentages “the strategy of selling options is at its core a strategy of using applied odds over time” the  figure rightly grabs people’s attention chat room “option geniuses” may argue this figure’s relevance but few will argue an option sellers advantage over an option buyer the fact that most investors don’t know how to harness these odds is not your problem let it be theirs this consistency – having the majority of your trades as winners instead of losers can be not only psychologically beneficial to you the trader but give you more focus to act when there is a risk measure to be employed or a new opportunity to capture  time is now your powerful ally investing is fraught with uncertainties but there is no greater certainty than the passage of time as an option seller time is your greatest ally ticking away at the value of your option as each day passes read moreclose time is on your side when selling or writing an option time value works for you instead of against you that means that whatever else is going on in the underlying market you enjoy the comfort of knowing that the unwavering hands of father time are always working in your favor when you sell an option the buyer of the option pays you a premium for that option if you sell an out of the money option the entire value of that option is in time value as time passes all other things remaining constant the option will gradually lose its value this is called time decay and it’s one of the main reasons selling options can be so effective it is for this reason that optionsellerscom pursues a strategy of selling deep out of the money options in client portfolios the closer an option gets to expiration the faster its rate of time decay the graph above illustrates the principle of time decay and its acceleration as expiration draws near an option is considered a “wasting asset” time value erodes as each day passes accelerating as the option’s expiration nears this is referred to as timedecay if the underlying contract’s price does not move to the option’s strike price by expiration the option will have no value left and expire worthless and the option seller will keep the premium of course as in any trading a large move in the underlying may result in a loss this is the concept on which our entire portfolio strategy is based notice that the value decays the fastest during the last  days of the option’s life  every trade has an expiration date whether you own a stock a piece of real estate or even a commodities futures contract one of the toughest decisions you’ll ever have to make is where to take profits on a successful trade avoiding that gutwrenching decision is a big benefit enjoyed by the option seller read moreclose no profit taking decisions you have a profit on your trade now what do you take the money off the table now and risk that your about to miss out on an even bigger move or do you “let it ride” and risk the profit you’ve already made one of the hardest parts of futures or any trading is deciding when to take profits with option selling if the market behaves favorably towards your position you are relieved from the responsibility of making this decision as time value decays your option the market will gradually take profits for you upon expiration if the option is still out of the money has not reached your strike price the entire premium for which you sold the option will be in your account at this time your position automatically closes out however you reserve the right to close out your short option position at any time prior to expiration as well – either as a loss limiting measure or as a profit taking move it’s a personal choice in regard to taking a profit some of the investors we’ve worked with find that it can be easier and require less effort to simply let the market “do it for them” of course no “safe” trading system has ever been devised and no one can guarantee profits or freedom from loss  ease of low maintenence unlike a stock option selling account if you sell options in the manner described on this website you won’t need to be by a computer screen all day read moreclose low maintenance account deep out of the money options tend to move slowly and do not require minute by minute maintenance that being said this isn’t a sell it and forget it strategy either your positions will need some adjustments from time to time many high net worth investors choose to remove themselves from the trading equation entirely instead hiring a professional to handle the day to day trading and position management for them now that’s low maintenance  security of investing in hard commodities commodities unlike stocks will always have a value read moreclose investing in real products that will always hold value – not a piece of paper  may seem like a long time ago but investors that watched their net worth melt away through that market collapse took a key lesson away from it – at the end of the day shares of stock are merely a piece of paper if you really want to drive that lesson home look up a little blip in the stock market that took place in  we all remember  remember lehman brothers or bear stearns how about enron on the days and weeks any of those events occurred when companies and paper became worthless or perceived to be worthless people still woke up and ate their corn flakes and drank their orange juice they still put gasoline in their cars and drove to work where they drank their coffee and ate their chocolate doughnut made with wheat sugar and cocoa and to comfort themselves they went home to their nice warm natural gas heated home got out a pound of ground beef raised on usda approved soybean meal for dinner and retired to their den here they retrieved their gold and silver coins they had hidden in the safe and counted them to comfort themselves in the moment why because they had value and they feared when they turned on their computer screen tomorrow all of that paper they had their money in would not “sugar can’t go bankrupt soybeans can’t go out of business” does this mean the commodities are always a better investment than stocks not at all one is not necessarily superior to the other are we suggesting that stocks are more dangerous or “risky” than commodities of course not what it does mean is that no matter what goes on in the world commodities such as the ones listed above will always have some kind of demand and where there is demand there will always be value it may not always be the same value but a value nonetheless a pound of sugar will always be worth something to someone same for a barrel of oil or a bushel of wheat as a high net worth investor you are likely already aware of the crucial practice of diversifying your assets with commodities you gain an extra feeling of security in knowing you have a component of your assets in investments you can hold in your hand –a lump of silver a gallon of gas a bushel of corn – things you can touch feel use no matter what happens in the world it remains likely that americans are still going to want breakfast in the morning and dinner at night fill up the gas tank stay warm or cool and feel “safe” with some precious metal in the closet the same cannot be said for pieces of paper that have names like “enron” or “lehman” printed on them “sugar can’t go bankrupt soybeans can’t go out of business commodities will always have a value”  relax you don’t have to try to predict the future anymore read moreclose no more trying to guess market direction no matter what they say nobody knows what any market is going to do especially on a shortterm basis however do enough homework and it is sometimes possible to make a fairly accurate projection of where prices will not go on a longer term basis by selling deep out of the money options you avoid the game of trying to predict where prices will go today tomorrow or next week instead you are only projecting where you think prices won’t go for instance if you are bullish the natural gas market you might sell a deep out of the money put option in this case the market can move up stay the same or even move down as long as it is above your strike price upon expiration you will still take your full profit as an option seller you accept the fact that you cannot predict the future you free yourself from the “need” for the market to move in a particular direction you are satisfied to simply “bet” against the unlikely events and then take a payment for your efforts – over and over again while there is still risk in this strategy you have the ability to profit regardless of which direction the market is moving or even if it does not move at all and you relieve yourself of the stress that comes from trying to accomplish the nearly impossible at the same time you’ll also free yourself from the requirement of having perfect timing when buying a stock or futures contract when you enter your position is just as important as what you are buying in selling deep out of the money options the option values typically aren’t moving as quickly as the underlying stock or commodity the fact that they are deep out of the money can mean that daily fluctuations in the underlying market may not have a large impact on the price of the option thus your timing becomes less important although all futures trading carries some degree of risk done correctly option selling can place your position in the market far enough away that short term swings in the market may not dramatically affect your position this not only gives you staying power but allows you to focus on longer term market fundamentals relief from this decision means lower stress for you “avoid the game of trying to predict where prices will go today tomorrow or next week the purpose of analyzing a market now simply becomes a practice of picking a far away point where it won’t go”  efficiency in keeping more of what you earn option selling is a taxfriendly strategy read moreclose  the option sellers tax advantage if you think you pay your “fair share” and then some commodity option selling could be the right strategy for you profits on option selling are taxed on the “” rule –  as short term capital gains but  at the same rate as dividends this makes them a favorable investment for those in high tax brackets in addition your end of year taxes on your commodity option selling account are surprisingly simple you get a straight  profitloss statement and you pay your taxes based on that one figure no more reconciling each and every trade for the yearthis aspect makes the investment both simple to account for and tax efficient the downside of option selling there is of course no perfect investment like any other form of wealth generation option selling has its risks and drawbacks the two main ones are these it can be slow and boring if you’re into active trading and the daily action of the markets – selling options in the manner prescribed here is not for you sure there will be days where some sort of activity is required however for the most part selling deep out of the money commodities options holds all of the excitement of watching paint dry – at least over the short term fat tail risk there is of course risk in selling options – even deep out of the money options while the risk of your options ever going in the money using the method we prescribe is remote your primary risk is that of the value of your option increasing usually the result of a sudden and sharp move in the underlying combined with a surge in volatility that is why experienced and diligent risk management is so critical to your performance contrary to popular belief there are a few simple yet highly effective methods of managing risk when selling options that being said in my  years of professional trading experience selling options is in my opinion and not without risk the single most productive approach i’ve ever found to growing long term equity in an account if you are an intelligent rational high net worth individual who is looking for an investment approach that targets high returns with reasonable risks has relatively high odds of success on each individual trade and requires a semi passive lower stress type of

premium discount  frequency as of   q  q  q  q  q  y view chart explanation download chart data csv how can the fund trade at a premiumdiscount to its nav the primary explanation is that timing discrepancies can arise between the nav and the closing price of the fund since shares of the fund trade on the open market prices are affected by the constant flow of information received by investors corporations and financial institutions depending on how this changing information affects investor sentiment shares of the fund may deviate slightly from the value of the funds underlying assets as a result shareholders may pay more than nav when they buy fund shares and receive less than nav when they sell those shares because shares are purchased and sold at current market prices however due to the creation and redemption process that is unique to etfs market makers are able to minimize these deviations from nav by taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities what causes these time discrepancies close of trading times although both the nav and the closing trade of the fund are generally calculated at the closing time of  pm eastern time slight differences in this timing may cause discrepancies time of last trade trading of global x funds generally takes place during normal trading hours  am to  pm eastern time however it is important to note that the last trade  from
