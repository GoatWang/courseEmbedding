that year said le now a texas instruments engineer the first few months i got good grades only in math and art but by the last six weeks i got straight as in addition to good grades she also learned the importance of determination and the willingness to work hard le is particularly proud of that school year because it represents a time when she had to try extra hard to succeed we got out of vietnam on april   just eight days before the country collapsed le said we got out on an american airplane and we were the first family to come to houston latest houston news video story continues below  le who came with her mother and six siblings said coming to america was exciting back home she had seen pictures and heard about the luxury in the united states where everything was big it was exciting to see the big freeways and the modern conveniences she said the hard part was i didnt understand a single thing in vietnam she would have entered the eighth grade but because of a language barrier le was put in the sixth grade she taught herself english by studying the dictionary everyday when she got straight as that final six weeks her teacher mrs perkins gave her a note that read i know you will succeed at whatever you do which was just the motivation she needed to push forward she asked her teacher if she could get bumped up to the ninth grade which was where she would have been in vietnam but her teacher said the reading level would be too difficult sad and discouraged le went home more determined than ever she marched over to pershing junior high school and pleaded her

objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump
