today if bdo and grant thornton wanted to merge to create another firm they could all im saying is theres no restrictions that allow for more firms to develop the kind of network that is necessary to serve the global capital markets i think there is so much competition in our marketplace today nally says forcefully theres a lot of experience that would say restricting services doesnt necessarily enhance audit quality or enhance relevance there could be a conflict of interest on anything if you are providing advice to a company then its up to them to make a decision as to how they want to use that advice run a company that was always my dream but over the last  years ive had a lot of fun doing what im doing if somebody is looking for an audit opinion to be  surety that there are no issues that can come up theres a cost associated with doing that kind of work there are a lot of lessons learnt coming out of satyam in a market like india that is fast growing that’s got a lot of opportunities you need to build an infrastructure to support that growth and making sure you have the right people in the right jobs so we made changes from the leadership standpoint to deal with that if a company is following acceptable accounting principles and reporting as such thats potentially an issue with the standard itselfhope viewers caught up the spark… recent sparks more feedback
