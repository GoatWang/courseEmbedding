but i enjoy it too i wish this book had been available when my children were young its not too wordy and teaches the value of money management in a brief colorful presentation that will hold a childs attention was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate simplyraising michigan age  gender female  stars out of  great lesson could have had biblical reference january   simplyraising michigan age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  this review was written for three cups a lesson in life and money for children three cups by tony townsley and mark st germain illustrated by april willy excellent teaching tool with a great story for all age children the expression on the childs face encourages you to really feel the moment he receives his gift from his perspective this story is about the gift of three cups given to the author by his parents one cup is for giving one is for saving and one for spending this is a great teaching tool for a christian parent who wants to instill the value in a child to give and save money i was disappointed that in the kindle addition you could not see the illustrations while reading the pages as they were on separate pages what was thought to be the worst gift ever at first site turned out to be a gift that lasted a life time and could be passed on for generations to come i would recommend this book to anyone who has children the book is great for my girls ages  and  as well as my boys  and  i read it to my  and  year olds also though they are not quite old enough to understand it is never too young to start learning about money another negative about this book was that it did not have bible verses nor did it talk about tithing in reference to giving you could incorporate that into a lesson using this book but it was not in it and i felt it should have been i give it a  star rating only because of the lack of biblical reference disclosure of material connection i received this book free from the publisher through the booksneezeãâ®com  book review bloggers program i was not required to write a positive review the opinions i have express in my reviews are my own they are based on mine

comment  permalink was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate just amy scranton pa age  gender female  stars out of  the pictures were pretty december   just amy scranton pa age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  this review was written for three cups a lesson in life and money for children i got the ebook version of three cups to review directly from the publisher at booksneezecom i did like the illustrations even on the ebook version however i was a little bit disappointed by the simplicity of the book im not sure if its because i already am aware of the idea of breaking your finances up into three cups or if i wanted a little more story along with the instructions i have actually tried the concept in the past with my children and had little luck every single one of them ended up playing with the cups  dumping the money out and stacking it upand i found it very hard to pay the children with the three cup method for example you cannot give a child a  bill or a  bill you have to give him a sum that is able to be broken up according to your spending habits so maybe my experiences colored my view of the book in a negative light it is beautifully illustrated but overly simplistic id like to see somewhere in the back some information on how to make this work in the real world was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate random ruthie  stars out of  december   random ruthie teaching children to use their money wisely is very important three cups provides a simple way to explain saving sharing and spending to children a five year old boy receives three cups from his parents on his birthday his parents explain that they will give him an allowance and each week they will help him put of the money in each of the three cups after a while he has collected enough money to start a savings account in the bank buy the baseball glove he wants plus a gift for his sister and help out some people in need the story format is very simple and is actually very similar to the way my parents taught me when i was little a good choice for parents to share with their children tommy nelson provided this book

  lisac post falls id age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  this review was written for three cups a lesson in life and money for children how exciting i really enjoyed this book  three cups by tony townsley with mark st germain it is a super short read only  pages  but it was great we are going to read it to our kids tonight and it has inspired me to want to try this tradition and teaching tool with them three cups is a wonderful story about a familys tradition to teach their young five year old son about a grand adventure using three cups the reader follows this young boy as he divides his weekly allowance between the three cups  saving spending and giving throughout the story the parents encourage their son and instill a sense of value for work money and giving with a little more discussion this could have been an a book the only thing i would have liked to have seen is what the lord has to say about money giving spending and saving overall though it is a sound way to encourage our youth to be responsible and teach the value of money management  patterns that can  if followed through with  will last a lifetime dont hesitate in getting this cute book for your
