financial officer and denny marie post who has been promoted to president of red robin congrats to both of these talented leaders after we deliver our prepared remarks well be happy to answer any questions you might have this quarter were shaking things up a bit and stuart brown is going to kick off the call with a brief update on q financials stuart stuart b brown  chief financial officer and executive vice president good morning and thank you all for joining us today following the prerelease and this mornings full earnings release ill keep my comments on our fourth quarter performance brief and then cover  outlook steve and denny will then fill in details on guest engagement and business initiatives that we have teed up for  and to support continued growth thereafter i will not be reiterating all the details in our earnings release or the supplemental reporting package so please refer to those for more information our  fullyear financial performance highlights includes comparable revenue growth of  which outpaced our peers by  according to black box adjusted ebitda growth of  to  million and adjusted diluted eps growth of almost  to  per share both ebitda and eps numbers are adjusted to exclude asset impairments a onetime benefit from a change in gift card breakage estimates in  and executive transitioning cost in  in the fourth quarter comparable restaurant guest counts were negative  which was  below the us casual dining peers according to black box average check increased  resulting in comparable restaurant sales growth being negative  on a constant currency basis although as a reminder our canadian operations have entered our comparable restaurant pool as of the fourth quarter despite the lower comp sales fourth quarter operating margins held up nicely as lower ground beef costs helped to offset the sales deleverage we experienced and expenses associated with newlydeployed restaurant technology this resulted in restaurant level operating margins of  at  basis point increase from a year ago for comparable units restaurant level operating profit per unit grew  despite the lower revenue for the fullyear our comparable restaurant level profit per restaurant increased  we opened  new restaurants in the fourth quarter bringing our total to  openings for the year including the reopening of one location which had been temporarily closed we are very pleased with the performance of our  new unit class with q being the highest quarter for openings in a very long time looking at other lines on the pl depreciation in q was favorable compared to our expectations we reviewed the useful lives of our fixed assets particularly assets associated with our remodel program which resulted in a net extension of the depreciable lives this change was made in q on a prospective basis and impacted deprecation in the quarter favorably by almost  million general and administrative costs selling expenses and preopening costs were all largely in line with our expectations the income tax rate was favorable to our outlook due mainly to congress extension of the workers opportunity tax credit in december wotc reduced our annual tax rate approximately  and impacted fourth quarter tax expense by about  million our capital investments in  totaled  million of which approximately  million was invested in brand transformation remodels  million in new restaurants and the remainder in technology restaurant maintenance and a singleunit franchise acquisition additionally we repurchased  million of our common stock during the year for  we expect capital expenditures of around  million of which about  million will be invested in new and relocated units and about  million on remodels and expansions with over  corporate locations conforming to our new brand standards at the end of  we anticipate transforming an additional  or so units this year in response to investor feedback we have changed the format of our outlook and now gives specific ebitda guidance in addition to other key metrics we expect ebitda in  to range between  million and  million the low end of the range assumes  casualdining traffic for the industry will be negative  or so continuing the trend from the fourth quarter of  as reported by black box our growth rate in  is expected to be limited due to cycling against the strong  results and higher  preopening costs as we increase our rate of opening new restaurants further we will incur costs for initiatives which steve will discuss with the benefit starting later in the year and increasing into  stock compensation which we add back to ebitda is expected to increase only slightly in  from  total revenues are expected to increase between  and  comprise of comparable restaurant revenue growth in the lowsingle digits and the remainder from operating week growth restaurant level margins are expected to increase modestly as lower cost of goods is mostly offset by higher labor rates particularly from californias minimum wage increase depreciation is expected to be between  million and  million as a result of the investments and remodeling to our new brand standards as well as the impact of new locations including those opened in  beyond  depreciation should increase more in line with new unit growth in addition to opening  to  new red robins and burger works in  we plan to close two and relocate four red robins locations this year we expect comp sales to be lowest in the first quarter of the year as we cycle over strong q  traffic growth and continue to shift our marketing and media which denny will discuss further first quarter gaap net income will be slightly lower than last year which included  million of benefits from the onetime gift card breakage and the lower workers comp and healthcare costs in the first quarter of  we have set a goal to double ebitda over the next five years and are building our pipeline of new units to achieve the sales growth needed to meet this target we set this aggressive goal to align our resources and initiatives and at the same time well also continue to grow our cash return on invested capital and create meaningful longterm value for shareholders steve and denny will take you through some of the initiatives underpinning red and marketing plans steve stephen e carley  chief executive officer  director thanks stuart few weeks ago at the icr investor conference in orlando we outlined our goforward plan that we dubbed red reflecting the objective of doubling ebitda by  this plan is focused on three areas revenue growth expense management and efficient capital deployment and id like to briefly touch on each one of these for you today lets talk about revenue we still have a material opportunity inside our four walls to increase sales at our current levels of traffic not surprisingly with all the changes weve made to our menu over the last several years weve seen both our seating efficiency erode and our ticket times increased this has the result of creating false waits and negatively impacting our guest experience currently our average seating efficiency is about  and our guest ticket times have climbed to  minutes our goal is to improve our guest seating efficiency to the  level while reducing our guest experience times down to  minutes by rolling out our new kitchen display system this year linked to a dynamic table management software these efforts can yield an increase in sales of approximately  million annually and significantly improve our guest experience by lowering their ticket times and improving the quality of our food at tableside we also have initiatives that focus on increasing guest preference by continuing to close red robin  basis point gap versus the industry average in our alcohol and beverage mix remember each  increase yields  million in incremental ebitda of course another major gap to close is the  basis point gap red robin has versus industry average in the area of togo this can yield as much as an incremental  million in ebitda in the years of  through  and denny will talk a little bit about this shortly were also excited about expanding our restaurant base we have a lot of white space and opportunity to bring new restaurants to markets where we currently have very low presence for perspective we have more restaurants in washington and oregon than we have total in the states of texas and florida lets move to e on the expense side one of our projects for  is to pilot our new supply chain management software which will replace our antiquated manual and timeconsuming current system this project alone represents a  basis point opportunity in margin improvement starting in  yielding improved control of waste and cost of goods while significantly reducing inventory levels at the restaurants as important as the pl benefits are we expect this new system to free up  hours per year per restaurant for our general managers who will now be able to spend time interacting with our guests and coaching and training our team members our guest insight work reveals that one of the key drivers of loyalty is the presence of a manager on the floor of the restaurant and this is where theyre going to be instead of manually filling out forms in the back office with the successful national rollout of the ziosk or robin as we call it at red robin weve addressed the number one pain point of casual dining being held hostage by your check red robin guests appreciate the ability to pay at the table and our team members get to spend more time engaging with them the device has also eliminated some nonvalueadded labor such as running back and forth clearing checks at a remote pos terminal the presence of this technology in our restaurants gives us a significant increase in our ability to effectively manage rising labor costs with creative staffing models that preserve our speed of service and maintain and enhance our guest satisfaction and finally under expense theres always a potential for greater ga leverage associated with higher revenues and the infrastructure improvements we continue to make which are easily scalable moving on to the d for capital deployment this year we expect to complete our brand transformation remodels in all company restaurants with franchise restaurants following closely behind well also be investing in additional restaurantlevel technology in  and beyond that will make our restaurants even more efficient and position us well for the future we have a number of ways to deploy capital going forward including other guestfacing technologies share repurchases and franchisee acquisitions remember the completion of our brand transformation efforts this year will generate a significant increase in free cash flow in  and beyond to reinvest in the business as returns warrant andor thoughtfully return to shareholders these three buckets revenue growth expense management and efficient capital deployment contain a robust series of strategies and tactics for the next five years enabling us to double our ebitda by  by growing our volumes within the current restaurants accelerating new restaurant openings and expanding our ebitda margins to bestinclass levels with that ill turn the call over to denny to discuss some of the marketing initiatives were excited about denny denny marie post  president thanks steve and good morning everyone as steve said we are coming to you from the home of the burger authority and i hasten to add the home of the super bowl champion denver broncos go broncos i will take the next few minutes to share what weve learned from the last quarter and how well be applying it to our marketing and menu plans going forward ever mindful not to tip our hand to competitors as we are all seeking to gain and hold the competitive edge in this very challenging consumer environment in q we were frankly swamped by competitive media pressure behind myriad  price point and socalled endless food promotions while it is nothing new for us to be outspent by bar and grill competitors it is no excuse and we should have been prepared to outthink them we have relied on our  every day value tavern double with bottomless steak fries televised message on and off for much of the last three years we did not have a goto backup tactic or compelling news worth talking about in earned media and pr channels when it became evident that the pressure was taking a toll the team rallies and got us back in the conversation first with tremendous pr behind our new finest chicken burger dubbed the marco pollo and then by dialing up our outreach to red robin royalty members with a profitable traffic driving  days of burgers promotion by quarters end we were back in the fight it set us up for a better course moving forward we are working in earnest on a new advertising campaign to improve breakthrough and on thoughtfully reconsidering our media spending patterns and choices changes will be evident in q and beyond we are also digging deep with our consumer insights team on what market factors are uniquely affecting our business research shows we are doing as good a job as ever perhaps even better at retaining core guests but that we need to compete more actively for those casual dining patrons we make choices more on current yields than on brand affinity this informed our decision to go onair a few weeks ago with a limited time double tavern double plus offer this offer invites guests to enjoy any two tavern doubles of their choice which include styles like the pig out or our fiery ghost with our famous bottomless steak fries and either a  appetizer or dessert to share for just  up to  in savings beyond this limited time offer we have dialed up our product pipeline across the barbell of burgers informed by concept research we will be driving talked about product news all year long while we continue to fuel and grow the red robin royalty program which offer significant resident value and is driving frequency amongst our core guests we ended the year with over  million registered members exceeding our expectations and supported by our new tabletop technology and burgers for better schools program in summary for the nearterm we will optimize our tactics and messaging to compete more aggressively for incremental guests longerterm we had two high priority opportunities that steve alluded to to drive organic growth continue to increase our sales of adult beverages specifically beer and getting in on the online togo game as you all know we have made steady yearoveryear progress on building our alcohol sales from the original take back the bar initiative to our every day value drink and beer pricing in lieu of happy hours to our rebranding as red robin gourmet burgers and brews we have built the business back from just over  mix to  we wont rest until we are back in doubledigits and we believe a focus on beer variety after all what goes better with a great burger than a perfectly paired beer will get us there we are finalizing an initiative to bring  taps and  bottles to every red robin increasing the number of draft lines and average of  making room for the ever popular nationally distributed draft beers and the higherend craft and local brews that guests are increasingly asking us for we will update you on our timing and outcomes as we move forward we have also fallen far behind competitors in the togo and catering space which are increasingly popular modes of access for guest who want options for restaurant food at home or in the office currently we mix below  for carryout and have no online ordering capability just lifting our mix to equal that of the average cdr players in this space would be the equivalent for us to building over  new restaurants we will get ourselves set this year with the technology operations experience and marketing learning we need to capture our fair share of this growing opportunity in  and beyond doing what we do best as the burger authority competing with smart dimes versus others dumb dollars and growing organically through higher ppa and togo will help us realize the revenue goals of red over the next five years so with that back to steve for final comments before we take questions stephen e carley  chief executive officer  director thanks denny to summarize there are significant opportunities that remain in place for us at red robin going forward and were very confident that the red roadmap will help us focus and capitalize on them driving us toward our goal of doubling ebitda by  as always id like to thank our red robin team members for their hard work and dedication as they continue to stand apart from the competition by greeting our guests with bottomless fun and a genuine spirit of service our teams are the reason we continue to be recognized as the burger authority at this point operator wed like to open it up for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you we will take our first question from joseph buckley with bank of america joseph terrence buckley  bank of america merrill lynch thank you could you just review the different technology initiatives and what can be implemented in  kind of across the waterfront there was mention of a lot of things but just to kind of understand the sequencing of it and how much – how many of those projects can be accomplished this year stephen e carley  chief executive officer  director thanks joe this is steve as we look across the next  months to  months the first technology following up on ziosk or our robin platform will be the kitchen display system which we expect to have implemented by midyear that is going to dramatically improve a couple of things first our food quality right now the technique we use in the back of the kitchen to make sure an item that takes  minutes to cook comes up with an item that takes  minutes to cook is we scream at each other what weve learned not surprisingly is this is not the most efficient method to do it so with kds there is algorithms that fire food exactly timed so that the full order for that table comes up at the same time in the expo window and can get delivered hot and fresh to the table were then going to follow that up a little later this year with a dynamic software for table management which is a way to seat guests more efficiently to make sure if theres two chairs two people sit in them and if theres four chairs four people sit in them this is also going to be linked to the kitchen display system so that the kitchen has a heads up digitally about what the wait times are looking like we are also going to pilot the comprehensive supplychain management system this year which is going to automate or arduous and manual inventories ordering and production processes in a restaurant this is a significant upside for us not only it will help us manage cost of goods and waste including liquor waste but its going to free up our general managers to spend time training their team members and interacting with guests so theyll be on the floor instead of sitting in the back office and we are also going to get after online ordering and a wait list management just the end of this year by putting those technologies in place so well get some payoff in  on kds and table management were going to pilot these other key technologies and well get the full benefits of them in year  and out joseph terrence buckley  bank of america merrill lynch okay and then – thats very helpful a question just on sales sequence you know it sounded like you took some initiatives toward the end of the fourth quarter and maybe ended the quarter a little bit better than the down  but i know the new advertising campaign is a secondquarter event and just curious kind of the sequencing of sales yeah particularly here – for the first quarter stuart b brown  chief financial officer and executive vice president joe yeah this is stuart i mean yeah we dont typically talk about results in our quarter i mean we did talk at icr a little bit about – and we talked about it here about coming back with new messaging and new news in december which helped us to bend the trend as we exited the quarter joseph terrence buckley  bank of america merrill lynch okay so you finished the – did you still finish the quarter negative or can you say that much stuart b brown  chief financial officer and executive vice president i mean the industry in december was negative i think casual dining was negative about  so our performance relative to the industry was better in december than the previous months but more detail than that were not going to give joseph terrence buckley  bank of america merrill lynch okay okay thank you operator and we will take our next question from john glass with morgan stanley john glass  morgan stanley  co llc thanks very much just first maybe on a high level so red youre going to grow double ebitda in five years so youre going to compound growth grow it at maybe  a year so how do you think about – is this primarily a revenue plan and expenses are secondary or is it balanced how do you think about the big buckets that you discussed and how they contribute to that  growth each year stuart b brown  chief financial officer and executive vice president yeah john this is stuart i think its going to be a combination of things some of its going to be topline driven which then you get leverage off of so in order to achieve that to your point yeah you need to get on average ebitda growth of  you need ebitda margins to expand our ebitda margins today are still probably around  basis points below industry so weve been just getting back to industry margins over that timeframe will cover a big piece of it so if you get top line growth – total revenue growth of call it  to  then youll need margin expansion of somewhere  basis points to  basis points in order to achieve that over the timeframe john glass  morgan stanley  co llc okay and if i were to just summarize how you think about the buckets for revenue it sounds like its the togo business and maybe the alcohol beverage business and then on the expense side its like kds and table management that kind of allows better labor – are those like the four or am i missing a couple of other big building blocks that will get you there stephen e carley  chief executive officer  director well this is steve remember the kds and table management piece is going to dramatically enhance our ability to grow the sales during particularly our peak times when were on wait in our existing four walls the supply chain stuff which we will pilot this year and begin to benefit for in  is going to help us on margin expansion and then ill turn it over to denny for a couple other major revenue growing initiatives that are big opportunities for us denny marie post  president obviously continuing to drive frequency through red robin royalty is a key for us and we continue to see upside there just frequency of visit makes a huge difference for us john and additionally some segmented and targeting efforts that weve got going on in our advertising programs i think can start to give us some edge as well john glass  morgan stanley  co llc and then just one final question this offer youre doing the  for  deal and you emphasized a few times limited so is this a onetime tactical offer or do you think you have to evolve to a more different i know youve had before an every day lower offer the tavern double but does it have to evolve to a permanent like more sharp value or is this just onetime tactic and then you feel like your prior value messaging really works on a more goforward basis denny marie post  president we are currently viewing it as a limitedtime tactic to bridge us to our next efforts around product news and i would say were always evolving so we just need to keep sharp john glass  morgan stanley  co llc okay thank you operator and we will take our next question from will slabaugh with stephens will slabaugh  stephens inc yeah thanks i want to ask about the tavern platform and future plans there so how did that platform trend during the period where you had increased discounting from a lot of your bar and grill peers and can you give us any more detail about what types of changes you feel like you need to make to better insulate your proposition to your guests denny marie post  president you know i dont think we saw material change in mix in q for tavern overall certainly emphasizing it now weve seen some uptake with taverns which is a good every day value trial tactic for us so the guests come to know us theres still limited awareness of the fact that we do have a  offering to start every day and then beyond that i think we have opportunity to always increase the value side of that barbell but to do so in a way that doesnt involve discounting as much as it involves every day value so we are working to see what other items we can add there that would bring some news will slabaugh  stephens inc got it and as a followup there are you planning that the burgerfocused discounting that we saw so heavily in q continues throughout  or are you assuming some of that tapers off which i realize weve seen some of it taper off already denny marie post  president in terms of competitors will slabaugh  stephens inc right denny marie post  president they use burgers a lot of times as the low end of their menu to pull other folks in to their entrées and other things so weve seen increased activity i wouldnt ever count it out and certainly would expect it to come back certainly by fall will slabaugh  stephens inc okay and lastly whenever you think about the buyback that you put out this morning that was a pretty big number so just curious on any sort of thoughts you can give us around how that could play out through  as you think about share repurchases stuart b brown  chief financial officer and executive vice president yeah will i think its very consistent with what weve been telling investors and shareholders in terms of our capital allocation strategy over the next few years that as we wrap up our brand transformation remodel program we will start to free up free cash flow and we will continue to look for ways to optimize returns for shareholders theres a number of different things we can do well get great returns on the technology were talking about so well put capital to work there and at some point though i expect that we will generate more free cash flows than we can effectively put to work at least for some periods of time and so well look for ways to return that to shareholders and expect that to be increasing as we look out over the next two years to three years will slabaugh  stephens inc thanks guys operator and we will take our next question from alex slagle with jefferies alexander russell slagle  jefferies llc hey thanks i just wanted to followup on joes question earlier on just the trends actually looking into the first quarter and weather – how we should think about weather and the super bowl having an impact on your business especially with the broncos involvement stuart b brown  chief financial officer and executive vice president yeah we had seattle last year which was a strong market for us as well so i think in terms of what were cycling over i mean we have weather every year our goal is to continue to outperform industry trends as i mean probably everybody saw black box and i guess maybe even knapptrack has released numbers as well i mean the industry cycled over a very strong january last year on our call a year ago we didnt talk about januarys performance because it was really strong you never know how the rest of the quarter is going to play out and well do the same thing now alexander russell slagle  jefferies llc and in the fourth quarter was california still a strong market for you or was there any change regionally stuart b brown  chief financial officer and executive vice president i mean california continues to perform well just as a regional market for us weve got – from an operations standpoint they do a fabulous job and the economy there has done – has held up nicely as well alexander russell slagle  jefferies llc great and then on the mix drivers for  i mean is there – how should we think about overall check growth from menu mix in  whether its the apps or beverages premium items stuart b brown  chief financial officer and executive vice president yeah i mean were going to continue i think a lot of the same efforts that weve been doing and denny talked about alcohol mix growing traffic counts as well and cranking up the togo as we get in later in the year i think from a pricing standpoint next year well continue to watch cogs the one thing i think for everybody to keep in mind is that the cogs benefit will be much greater in the first half of the year like ground beef prices really came down really sort of in the august timeframe of  and so through that well be cycling against higher numbers really for the next six months or seven months and then the cogs numbers below as we get further in the year well give more guidance on sales denny marie post  president id also point you to our current promotion so weve just rolled back into the wild pacific crab cake burger which has returned for the lenten season i was at red robin last night in enjoyed one it was terrific and i also started off with voodoo fries which is – will blow your head off ill tell you that it is smoking hot and enjoyed the voodoo fries to start the meal last night so were continuing to drive news with that i didnt have room for my root beer float cake but i did take some doh rings to go using robin to order and so continue to see a lot of opportunity across all elements and my husband had a beer alexander russell slagle  jefferies llc sound good denny marie post  president those opportunities continue to exist i try to go to the restaurant wherever i can to model that kind of behavior alexander russell slagle  jefferies llc got it well thank you operator and we will take our next question from imran ali with wells fargo imran ali  wells fargo securities llc hey good morning thanks for taking my questions with your accelerating pace of development this year and going forward what is the cadence of these openings in  stuart b brown  chief financial officer and executive vice president yeah i mean its inherent in our overall revenue guidance we were quite backend weighted in   will be a little bit more balanced its still fairly backend weighted i would say sort of on average weve got about half of them still opening in the late third quarter fourth quarter but itll be more wellbalanced and thats whats inherent in the operating week guidance imran ali  wells fargo securities llc okay understood and just looking beyond this year hows your pipeline if its not too early to talk about it hows your development pipeline shaping up in  and also can you remind us what you believe your ultimate unit potential is stuart b brown  chief financial officer and executive vice president yeah the overall unit potential yeah its been a little while since weve updated it but there continues to be at least  additional sites as we look out there especially as weve gone more towards building the midsized units they cannibalize less so we can build tighter densities of networks which is great and more profitability team member training openings of those have been great and so if we got the pace back up to call it  per year which i think is where we peaked in the mids i think its something we could handle from management perspective the pipeline is getting in better shape weve reorganized our real estate team reengaged brokers weve changed a number of processes and so in addition to having a better pipeline our development timelines are coming down in terms of how long it takes us to get locations opened from when we get a lease signed so were feeling very good and then we see an increasing number of conversions of existing change as well we got landlords coming to us to take over other restaurant spaces imran ali  wells fargo securities llc okay great thanks very much operator and we will take our next question from david carlson with keybanc david carlson  keybanc capital markets inc hey thank you so much denny stuart brought up a couple of minutes ago in discussing mix he also discussed traffic initiatives as well but its not really apparent from the recent results that the remodel program has driven much samestore sales improvement and traffic performance over the last year was pretty volatile so realizing you dont want to tip your hand to the competition but hope you can help us understand what are the most important initiatives to drive a sustainable traffic growth this year denny marie post  president i think competing as we talked about for that deal buyer to start off of the year getting back in the conversation with regards to product news candidly we didnt have a lot go on past midsummer of last year when we were tied in with the terminator movie and got a lot of activity around that terrific burger so the eternal combinations of great value and great news and then once theyre in the restaurant getting them to step up to whether its the finest mix which continues to grow – our marco pollo chicken item that we just added there has been doing really really well were very pleased with that or adding on the things weve talked about alcohol apps and desserts and with regards to bti those locations continue to outperform those we have not yet transformed so its still the right thing for us to have done moving the business forward and inviting our guests in for multiple occasions particularly in an economically pressed environment we want to make sure were capturing adult dinein as well as family david carlson  keybanc capital markets inc maybe just a followon to that we saw selling expense down  yearoveryear in the fourth quarter which likely led to that traffic number you guys said up front but would you say that – would you expect selling expense to be down in any other quarters yearoveryear in  stuart b brown  chief financial officer and executive vice president selling expense patterns will largely – i mean as a percentage of sales – will stay largely the same in  as it did in  and the timing of that gets impacted by the different things just gift card costs and timing of media but overall denny marie post  president were not cutting back stuart b brown  chief financial officer and executive vice president its going to be largely the same were not going to be cutting back denny marie post  president were not cutting back david carlson  keybanc capital markets inc okay fair enough and then one more if i can you guys have noted that the red royalty program is really an important part obviously of the overall marketing strategy i was hoping you guys could let us know what percentage of your sales is generated by that loyalty program denny marie post  president like you know we let everybody else know were not going to do that sorry david carlson  keybanc capital markets inc okay stephen e carley  chief executive officer  director its material and growing denny marie post  president its material and growing david carlson  keybanc capital markets inc fair enough but if i can add something on to that are these numbers more or less reliant than nonloyalty members to keep on usage and other discounts is really what im getting at denny marie post  president theyre responsive to great offers but as you remember our program is structured primarily on the earned value of buy  get  and thats the majority of how our guests engage with it and otherwise it becomes an opportunity for us to speak directly to them about things like the lenten crab cake being cake or to go out and tap into them with something like  burgers of christmas which we did the end of last year but i wouldnt say theyre any more reliant on it it certainly creates resident value for them stephen e carley  chief executive officer  director david recognize that with this base of users we understand both their frequency of visit and their spend and so we dont market to this base the same way we can put an offer to someone who hasnt been in for six months its very very different than someone who comes in on a monthly basis and thats one of the secrets to the program it allows us to microtarget specifically against users frequency and spend levels appropriately to see if we can generate the behavior we want so its much better than say some of our competitors here in denver as an example who will drop a sunday insert in the denver post basically carpet bomb the market with two units we dont have to do that david carlson  keybanc capital markets inc thank you guys for the time denny marie post  president thank you stephen e carley  chief executive officer  director welcome operator and we will take our next question from brian vaccaro with raymond james brian m vaccaro  raymond james  associates inc thanks and good morning just a couple of quick ones for me first just back on the fourth quarter comp stuart can you provide the price mix breakout of your average check in the quarter stuart b brown  chief financial officer and executive vice president yeah price was – in the fourth quarter was about  of the total brian m vaccaro  raymond james  associates inc okay all right and sorry if i missed this but how are you thinking about menu price increases as we move through  stuart b brown  chief financial officer and executive vice president yeah i think overall i mean the guidance assumes sort of price mix total of call it  to  and then well break out more of that as we get through the year and see what happens from a cogs perspective and how much we need to take brian m vaccaro  raymond james  associates inc okay all right and on the  guidance i appreciate the ebitda guidance you provided but as you think about store margins i think you said modest leverage in  can you provide a little more color as it relates to sort of your food and labor cost outlook in terms of the inflation or deflation as it would seem were going to see on the food cost side stuart b brown  chief financial officer and executive vice president yeah i mean – i think obviously the – i mean in total  will probably look a lot like it did in  obviously higher labor inflation particularly with california minimum wages going up  as of january and so youve got – and youll have cogs that will be for the year flat to slightly down obviously within the seasonality that i talked about earlier on that brian m vaccaro  raymond james  associates inc so on the labor side specifically i think in the past you talked maybe about lets say a  type of range stuart b brown  chief financial officer and executive vice president yeah  to  brian m vaccaro  raymond james  associates inc  to  okay all right and then just last one on the ga outlook i know you didnt guide for this specifically but it looks like youre expecting relatively flat just sort of looking at your ebitda guide are there any costs associated with the technology and equipment rollouts that you discussed in that or is that purely flowing through capex stuart b brown  chief financial officer and executive vice president no some of thats in the ebitda guidance as well some of that will hit the restaurant some of that will hit ga and so youll get some ga growth with inflation but also new unit growth largely and then some of it is also recycling that we had with the rollout of robin last year some of last years technology – there is something inherent already in the run rate brian m vaccaro  raymond james  associates inc okay all right fair enough just one last quick one on the acceleration in your unit growth thats underway can you speak to the unit economics that youve achieved say in the class of  and  that have sort of reached a maturity curve here thats supports that accelerated rollout can you give an update on that stuart b brown  chief financial officer and executive vice president yeah no we continue to be really really pleased with how theyre doing again we balanced out the number of openings between whats in our core existing markets and whats in new markets and so i mean overall the blended returns continue to be irr in the upper teens on average and that you get  to  cashoncash return and we continue to see some inflation in build costs particularly in the pacific northwest and in the northeast but those returns are holding up nicely brian m vaccaro  raymond james  associates inc okay thank you operator we will take our next question from steve anderson with maxim group stephen anderson  maxim group llc yes so good morning and i know you have discussed some of your bar and grill competition it looks like if i read it correctly like some of the burgerbased promotions maybe – may have decelerated a bit from what you saw in the fourth quarter but what about whats going in the quickservice burger segment i dont know if youre seeing any kind of defection there and i know that they had a fantastic quarter in the entire segment but i just want to see if thats the kind of – if you see any kind of overlap with those kind of customers denny marie post  president i was going to say certainly with burgers being one of the most popular menu items right up there with pizza youre always going to see some overlap of usage but we have not seen that i dont think specifically particularly when you look at occasions and how we meet different occasions per guest that occasion is primarily filled by togo onthego lunch drivethrough now obviously with being able to get breakfast at least one or two places all day long there is some pressure there but its a different occasion than we serve with the fullservice dinein stephen anderson  maxim group llc okay thank you operator and we will take our next question from joseph buckley with bank of america joseph terrence buckley  bank of america merrill lynch thank you round two just a couple of quick ones did canada entering the fourth quarter comps have a significant impact one way or the other stuart b brown  chief financial officer and executive vice president yeah i mean i wouldnt say its significant because of the number of restaurants but given the impact of the lower oil prices and what thats doing on the economy in alberta the impact was negative i mean canada underperformed the us so from a comp standpoint it was negative   i think on the topline really economicallydriven denny marie post  president yeah  of our  locations are in edmonton alberta and theyve been very very heavily affected joseph terrence buckley  bank of america merrill lynch okay and then im curious on the time the service time growing so much longer do you have a sense of what has driven that as you attempt to drive those service times – to take the table service times back down stephen e carley  chief executive officer  director sure joe if you look back at our menu five years or six years ago we had a line of gourmet burgers that had a multiple different buns the same size patty and different builds fast forward to today we have the entire tavern platform which tends to cook much more quickly than another platform weve put in place that we really really love which is the finest platform so if you come in with me and i get a tavern double and you get a smoke and pepper the difference in cook times is material in the kitchen weve simply asked our people to figure it out and as we add more apps and more desserts and as we added more nonalcoholic beverage options weve reached a point where we need to give those heart of the house teams the tools – the technology tools that quite frankly many of our – almost all of our competitors already have to help them manage the variance in cook times to ensure that a table of four entrées comes up all at the same time in the passthrough window and is immediately run to the table we have a high level of confidence the technology were putting in place is going to really address that issue joseph terrence buckley  bank of america merrill lynch okay and then just a question on the finest mix denny i think you said it continues to rise are you seeing any leveling effect there is there some natural ceiling to – that you could see in the trend in terms of how high that finest mix can go denny marie post  president thats part of the reason that we are relying so heavily on or things like the crab cake bringing it back right now it attracts a different users joe so you can broaden the mix beyond what beef is able to do why we focus on ltos like the mad love which was so popular in december the results on those who tried that burger are just through the charts in terms of interest in repeat purchase and then having just launched the marco pollo weve actually seen mix double from holiday to winter so as we drive trial its really stepping up and we know that adding different proteins to that line had the opportunity to continue to grow it joseph terrence buckley  bank of america merrill lynch okay thats helpful thank you denny marie post  president sure operator and this concludes our questionandanswer session and i will now turn the call back over to mr carley for closing remarks stephen e carley  chief executive officer  director thanks everybody
