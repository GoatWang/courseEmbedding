first memories of any mechanical ability was around  years old when my uncle shorty would come to visit and show me his tricks on making a stick welder weld by itself in dads backyard shop i was hooked on welding instantly from that point and that bug is stronger than ever today i started rebuilding car engines at  and loved the fact that i could tear something down put it back together and it would work who would have thought at that age you would know what you were going to do for the rest of your life i went to work full time for springs industries in  while still in high school i

objectivity during our phone conversation robby took a lot of time to speak with me and answer my questions it is absolutely clear to me that you are honest and professional people that are more
