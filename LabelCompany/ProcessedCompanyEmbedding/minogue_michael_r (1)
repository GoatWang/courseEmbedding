morning everyone abiomed achieved our best ever quarterly results with revenue of  million revenue growth of  and grew protected pci us procedures by  as a business we continue to execute on our protected pci launch impella rp training expanding the global cvad registry increasing manufacturing capacity and advancing our regulatory progress in the us and japan i want to recognize and thank the employees for their ability to adapt and execute on multiple projects we have great momentum and our success is based on years of maintaining a focus on improving patient outcomes and building trust with our customers and stakeholders our performance over the past four quarters validates abiomed as one of the fastest growing gaap profitable medical technology companies overall abiomed has now grown top line revenue double digits yearoveryear for  straight quarters for todays call we will provide a summary of our protected pci launch and briefly comment on our new products us patient utilization increased  driven by record number of protected pci patients as a reminder protected pci includes elective and urgent highrisk patients and grew  these results confirmed the growing clinical need and new patient population in the cath lab which we estimate at  potential patients per year this fda approval makes impella the only safe and effective percutaneous circulatory support device for the highrisk pci indications additionally emergency impella support increased to  and we believe this potential population represents another  patients per year as weve discussed on our last earnings call abiomed submitted its fda pma supplements for impella cp and impella  as noted at our investor day in august abiomed estimates that we are treating approximately  of the total addressable market of  us patients our  fiveyear vision baseline model projects in the us only a  billion market this growth rate matches our last five quarters and represents a  penetration of the total addressable market our major focus in fiscal  as demonstrated at tct will be establishing protected pci as a new treatment paradigm in heart failure these patients may benefit from pci but have poor heart function complex coronary artery disease and comorbidities that likely require hemodynamic support for complete revascularization in a high risk intervention most of this patient population has likely been turned down or not considered for surgery by a heart team because of age or surgical risk factors the growth for our first half of the year signals the significance of our fda approval and impact of our clinical education to not only the interventional cardiologist but to the referring physicians and patients over the recent months abiomed has had  new publications  speaker programs  educational courses five global events including tct and  mobile learning lab hospital stops around the country in addition this was the first tct where abiomed was able to educate our users in the patient identification process we had five live protected pci cases and multiple symposiums abstracts and course presentations with over  physicians in attendance for the first time at tct abiomed highlighted the clinical benefits of protected pci which include a  reduction in mace a  reduction in heart failure classification and a  reduction in repeat procedures we will continue to focus on training and education as the new standard of care also at tct we introduced some of our future products to our customers including impella ecp which stands for expandable cardiac power on a complete  french impella catheter and pump the next generation impella cp with an increased flow of  liters per minute and smart sensor technology the impella  with a smaller profile and designed for months of flow of  liters per minute and patient ambulation and finally the longer term impella btr product which stands for bridge to recovery which is designed to provide up to a year of greater than  liters of flow driven by a wearable driver in summary we have had an exciting start to fiscal year  with first half revenue growth of  and establishment of protected pci as a new indication as evidenced by our patient growth and awareness at tct protected pci has been validated by physicians that treat higher risk patients requiring percutaneous hemodynamic support in the cath lab we are confident that in the years ahead abiomed will deliver strong growth support new indications in countries and launch new bestinclass products we appreciate the support of our investors and are focused on achieving our goals as always abiomed is committed to meaningfully impacting the lives of our patients and helping our physicians improve outcomes i will now turn the call over to our cfo mike tomsicek michael john tomsicek  chief financial officer  vice president thanks mike good morning everyone in addition to the many important accomplishments just mentioned benefiting patients and caregivers abiomed has achieved some very impressive financial milestones as well fiscal q was another record quarter for revenues and our balance sheet numbers are very encouraging as noted in this mornings earnings release second quarter revenue increased  to a record  million this is the fourth consecutive quarter wherein broadbased patient utilization momentum delivered industryleading revenue growth us impella revenue rose  to a record  million driven by a  increase in patient utilization we were pleased with this bestinclass yearoveryear and sequential growth especially considering the significant summer slowdown in us cath labs during july and august outside the us impella revenue totaled  million on a constant currency basis this was up  worldwide revenue – worldwide service revenue of  million was up  as of the end of the second fiscal quarter the impella  has been placed at  of approximately  targeted hospital sites for a penetration rate of  impella cp has been placed at  hospital sites for a penetration ratio of  of total hospitals our primary focus continues to be increasing usage at existing sites however the addition of more  sites and the introduction of cp  and rp to existing impella sites is a platform for future growth we have a disciplined approach to establishing new impella programs focused on training and achieving quality patient outcomes reorders continue to be the driving force behind our growth with us reorders at  million and growing  versus prior year and our reorder rate was  average impella  and impella cp inventory at hospital sites was  units per site versus  in the prior quarter and  units in the prior year so inventory growth is far below the growth in usage these inventory levels are appropriate reflecting hospitals reliance on abiomed for rapid restocking but customer inventory levels are expected to grow slowly as utilization increases and new cp  and rp products are introduced to sites gross margin for the quarter came in at  reflecting continued strong production volumes and favorable euro exchange rates but slightly lower product yields than the prior quarter driven by new product and process introductions rd expense for the second fiscal quarter totaled  million and was approximately  of revenue rd expense includes the submission of the pma supplements for impella cp and  the ongoing japanese pmda submission investment in the global cvad registry and additional expenses associated with the new product development as discussed in our recent investor day these investments could lead to rd expenses for the third and fourth quarters that are  million to  million higher than our q rate and this investment is important in the context of our year  vision sga expense for the second fiscal quarter totaled  million up  from the prior year there are a number of investments that will boost sga for the balance of the year some of these investments are in continuing expansion of our commercial team where  heads were added this quarter to a total of  professionals and we have made further investments in marketing and infrastructure operating profit for the second fiscal quarter was  million or  of revenue compared to profit of  million in the prior year gaap net income for the quarter of  million or  per diluted share compared to income of  million in the prior year or  per diluted share although we are recording a gaap income tax provision at an effective tax rate of  our cash tax payments are negligible due to the application of net operating loss carryforwards from our balance sheet the company has approximately  million additional deferred tax asset value remaining primarily due to nols the balance sheet remains in excellent shape and we ended the quarter with cash and short and longterm marketable securities growing about  million to a balance of  million one final note from the quarter our past present and future intellectual property and knowhow holds an enormous position in the world of percutaneous circulatory support in the past thoratec attempted to invalidate certain impella patents in europe and failed during this quarter we responded to further challenges and filed our own case in germany against thoratec now st jude for patent infringement abiomed had invested over  million in research and development on percutaneous high pump technology and we hold  patents and have  patents pending this patent portfolio and our strong financial position make us well prepared to assert our pattern right turning to guidance as noted in our earnings release we have increased the full year fiscal  revenue guidance and the new range is now  million to  million representing growth of  to  from the prior year this new range compares to the range noted on our last conference call of  million to  million which had been  to  growth from the prior year the company is updating its fiscal year guidance of gaap operating income to a range of  to  this new range compares to  to  previously guided these margin ranges incorporate the rd spend level increase previously mentioned in summary q was a very strong quarter demonstrating that we are the standard of care these results validate our business strategy todate and enable us to make the disciplined investment needed to help abiomed achieve our longterm vision operator would you please now open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from the line of ben andrew with william blair your line is open kaila p krum  william blair  co llc hi guys this is kaila in for ben so just understanding that you all dont want to provide longer term guidance but trying to piece together sort of the big picture commentary at the analyst day which i think implies sort of a  annual growth rate over the next several years and then just pairing it with really strong recent performance which would suggest that that sort of target is likely achievable just benchmarking that commentary against your guidance today which would suggest a growth rate in the high s can you just help us understand the disconnect there and if there have been any changes to that longterm viewpoint michael r minogue  chairman president  chief executive officer kaila this is mike thank you for the question our longterm shareholders have been requesting our longterm vision for several years and theyve been asking for details for our plans to invest around manufacturing distribution and research so at our investor day and based on our pma approval we wanted to give clarification and give you all visibility to the total addressable market but also our assumptions of penetration and what we stated was we believe today were getting  of the total patient population which we outlined as  patients if we grow at the same rate as the past five quarters not including q this past quarter that equals  billion in us revenue so thats our baseline goal and remember outside the us is  million so let me say that again the same growth rate weve had from q back is a growth rate of  thats the baseline vision for five years thats a  cagr and that represents a  penetration and today were at  that represents a  penetration of the  potential patients the top end of that is if we penetrate  of the market thats where we had the range of in the us  billion to  billion and then if you added the outside us which we didnt give as much visibility to thats the  million thats the range so in the us what were saying is our cagr growth is anywhere from  to  which puts you between  billion and  billion in five years and that represents going from a  penetration rate to a  penetration rate and up – max range would be a  penetration rate so what we thought was important is to give you all the market our assumptions and its not a forecast but its our goal and now you can understand why were investing in manufacturing and distribution and research and you can do your own modeling based on our penetration rates all of these assumptions if we go one level deeper assumes a  penetration rate of the intraaortic balloon pump so we think that the balloon pump is an inferior technology but in all our models we assumed a  penetration rate of patients that used to be treated with balloon pumps and then just one last thing as far as the growth rate over the five years weve grown double digit for the last six years every quarter but what we expect the growth to look like is to be a series of inflection points with multiple triggers so for example protected pci is a trigger the impella rp rollout when we start expanding more sites will be a trigger point in emergency pma approval on our cp  and cp  will be a trigger point and the japanese launch will certainly be a trigger point for growth and then in the long term we have the new products we have additional geographies and we have new age indications such as the stemi population which we outlined at the analyst day and none of those projections of revenue are included theres not anything included in our fiveyear vision for any of those products or revenue or new indications hope thats helpful kaila p krum  william blair  co llc yeah thats perfect and then i guess just coming out tct i mean with all the excitement around protected pci can you just comment i mean on your level of comfort i know you had pegged that opportunity at about a  patients what inning do you think that were in with respect to expansion into that patient segment and just given that excitement could we potentially see that  patient estimated opportunity prove conservative michael r minogue  chairman president  chief executive officer well there certainly was a lot of excitement we had five live cases and in any live case you can have  to  people sitting in the audience all of our symposiums were standing room only in fact one of them they had to close the door and they couldnt let anyone else in the room so theres great excitement and whats important is that the interventional cardiology community sees this as an opportunity to treat patients that are being turned down for surgery and that can benefit of a complete revascularization because they have ischemic disease and they do better – for that right patient population they do feel better and it does reduce their heart failure symptoms and were able to reduce repeat procedures by  so thats great for multiple parties do we think its conservative what weve identified and we laid out also for our investors so you can plug in your own assumptions is were really looking at class iii and class iv patients that – of that there are about  million about  of coronary artery disease about  of those have low ejection fraction about  of those are between ages of  and  and then you break it down to of those how many have good vessel targets and are not cabg candidates and then the last is only about  are actually diagnosed with an ischemic test so thats the  patients but certainly theres a growing epidemic of heart failure in many cases due to either the need for revascularization or the need for improvement in muscle function so were focused on the  patients and we are the standard of care and i do believe what you saw at tct was that protected pci is a new treatment option for heart failure kaila p krum  william blair  co llc perfect thank you operator our next question comes from the line of raj denhoy with jefferies your line is now open raj s denhoy  jefferies llc hi good morning michael r minogue  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning raj raj s denhoy  jefferies llc mike wonder if i can ask sort of following up on last question coming out of tct again the excitement was pretty palpable around protected pci when we think about the growth the companys experiencing and the growth going forward what do you view is kind of the gating issues at this point is it being able to train and support clinicians as they adopt the technology or is it something other than that that perhaps is not – not that youre not growing well but that could keep growth from accelerating even further michael r minogue  chairman president  chief executive officer raj for years we have been saying its training and data training and data and training is ease of use and data is the all the publications to the regulatory approvals from a execution perspective the way we look at it is kind of back to the steps or the triggers the pma for the  impella  for protected pci is we have to execute and we have the opportunity and weve identified the patient population the pma supplements for shock and again on cp and  impella cp and impella  thats – we still expect to have that approved as we stated last quarter sometime this coming summer the rp impella rp approval were doing the initial rollout but we havent really expanded it so were approximately a little over  patients into october and were making sure those sites are getting good outcomes and you can be sharing best practices on future training centers and that will be another execution story and education story and we have a lot of other items we have to execute on so thats really the hurdle here is a focus and expanding the registry the manufacturing the marketing and the result is that we want to have ethical growth we want the right patients but we also want to get the best outcomes and make sure that this is seen as a standard of care and a new therapy because were looking at this as a  year process and our company i think weve shown that we know how to adapt and execute and as a result thats why were one of the fastest growing medtech companies raj s denhoy  jefferies llc when you gave this number of  sales people i think it was whats the right number when you think about youve identified  cath labs as your potential target how many sales people do you think you need to get to in order to effectively service the market united states michael r minogue  chairman president  chief executive officer raj the question on the right number is a function of how many patients were doing per week and how many patients are done independently so we continue to add  patients to  patients in fact i think last quarter we added more than that and were going to stay on that pace for at least the next four quarters but it currently feels right but as this growth is happening were adding ahead of the schedule so that we can have that six month window to train them before we get them completely engaged into the process raj s denhoy  jefferies llc okay then just lastly you mentioned the intellectual property litigation in germany is there any more youre willing to provide at this point in terms of what you asserted in that litigation and any particulars around timing michael r minogue  chairman president  chief executive officer i guess we dont give comments on the specifics of our timing strategy or tactics with our ip but just to be clear these law suits impact st judes ability to commercially sell php and none of these cases will impact our ability to sell impella and st jude has reported pushing the commercial launch in europe i believe until  raj s denhoy  jefferies llc okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jayson bedford with raymond james your line is now open unknown speaker hi guys this is mike  calling in for jayson this morning thanks for taking the questions michael r minogue  chairman president  chief executive officer morning mike  unknown speaker first off obviously youre seeing strength in a lot places here but just wondering in terms of the breadth of use you see anything different in terms of whos using the device meaning are you seeing a lift in the number of cases at the lower volume centers or is it more increased usage at your high volume centers michael john tomsicek  chief financial officer  vice president i would say looking at the numbers closely through the summer months there was a little bit greater impact to slowdown at some of the larger centers so compared to previous quarters probably more the mid or smaller centers were a larger source of growth than they had been but as you said at the beginning of your question all segments of the market continue to grow unknown speaker okay great thats helpful and then i was wondering if you could give a breakout of the mix between protected pci emergent use and in other michael john tomsicek  chief financial officer  vice president yeah so from the earlier section the mike covered the – let me just – yeah ive got it – the prophylactic use of the device was  thats the fastest growing segment now as a result protected pci it grew  and emergent use was  of the mix it grew  which is still very healthy and the remaining  is for all other applications unknown speaker okay great and then just lastly can you give us a mix of revenue by devices in the quarter michael john tomsicek  chief financial officer  vice president right so as a percentage of revenue  was  of revenue cp was  of revenue and the  was  of revenue with rp at just  cp is the fastest growing its growing at  and  grew at  unknown speaker great very helpful nice job in the quarter guys michael john tomsicek  chief financial officer  vice president thanks mike  operator our next question comes from the line of david lewis with morgan stanley your line is now open scott s wang  morgan stanley  co llc hi guys this is actually scott wang in for david mike just a question on guidance given kind of both strong placements and utilization in our model your guidance range implies that your penetration rate increased quartertoquarter sequentially kind of falls into the back half fiscal  which doesnt seem to make sense to me given theres clearly strong demand and underlying momentum would you agree that your guidance range looks conservative in its slowing growth outlook or may i missing something michael john tomsicek  chief financial officer  vice president im – was a little bit confused about the part of your question where youre talking about the penetration rate into the second half could you repeat that statement and clarify that scott s wang  morgan stanley  co llc sure so in a model essentially we try to track kind of total impella patients and patient volumes as a – and the utilization rate as a percentage of the addressable market that you laid out at your analyst day and in my mind it seems like the rate of increase seems to be slower in the back half of the year than it has been in the front half of the year michael john tomsicek  chief financial officer  vice president okay when you look back at – as some investors ask us questions about when the inflection started or why the inflection started there was a steep increase in our growth starting four quarters ago and the current performance in the last couple quarters had to do with the inflection around protected pci and so in the second half of the year were a little bit further from that inflection and were up against some comparables from previous year where some inflection had already started and in addition to that were trying to guide to a level of high – a high level of certainty associated with the sales performance for the rest of our year and i think that combination of factors is what led to our guidance so one is really when this inflection started and the second is just a conservative approach to numbers that we can hit scott s wang  morgan stanley  co llc thats fair thank you and then i guess looking back at tct obviously st jude thoratec came out with some early data on php and i was curious as to what you thought of that early data even though – it was – whether you thought that was interesting despite the fact that we only saw a few patients for php michael r minogue  chairman president  chief executive officer so scott this is mike minogue st jude is a very credible company and has really done a nice job in working with the heart failure community and we feel their interest in this space essentially has validated the size of the market and the benefits of protected pci for those that attended the presentation of shield i the primary investigator ada polin  referred to protected pci twice during the tct presentation so were very pleased with the awareness growing but i would say today the most important point for our investors to comprehend today is that were very confident in our technological advantages and part of this is based on the recent clinical results though its a small number but they are clinical results on the php which were publicly reported at tct the results highlighted some concerns around adverse events associated with the use of this device and for our investors to understand what the product is its a catheter pump thats  french as compared to our  french and the median estimated flows that they reported is very impella like median flows were  liters per minute and specifically in their shield  and their php shock results which were five patients there suggests there is a potential risk to the aortic valve during and after the procedure for these highrisk patients specifically in regard to impella in protect i and protect ii  of the  patients had aortic insufficiency and it was defined by an independent physician through an echo ultrasound assessment and it was done on a fda designated endpoint but – so what we would do is encourage all our investors to review the php results and were happy to report that protected pci was a major theme at tct and also that impella remains the standard of care scott s wang  morgan stanley  co llc thats great mike thank you michael r minogue  chairman president  chief executive officer thanks scott operator our next question comes from the line of jan wald of benchmark your line is now open jan d wald  the benchmark co llc good morning everyone congratulations on the quarter i guess a lot of my questions have been answered but i guess one question would be you didnt mention japan at all today or at least much in your opening comments any progress on that or anything different to report than weve already heard michael r minogue  chairman president  chief executive officer relative to our regulatory path both the us and japan remain on track with what we stated last quarter so we expect to have approvals this coming summer on both jan d wald  the benchmark co llc okay and i guess you talked about manufacturing and facilities expansion could you could talk a little bit about what that means in terms of capex requirements and how we should understand that spend over the next while michael john tomsicek  chief financial officer  vice president yeah i think in – soon well be able to give a little bit more clarity around capital expenditures i do expect some capital expenditures in the second half of our fiscal year im not prepared to give a forecast yet at this point in time theres a couple of things that could go either way but there will be several millions of dollars of investment in manufacturing thatll be necessary to sustain the increase in production that weve had and when we get further details beyond that well be sure to share it with everyone jan d wald  the benchmark co llc okay and i guess my last question is ive been going to tct for about  years now and this is – i would say the cases that i saw especially cases that involve the impella were some of the toughest cases i have ever seen in those  years how do you think impella performed in – and especially in the live cases that you saw do you think those cases would have been able to have been done without the impella well i guess thats the question michael r minogue  chairman president  chief executive officer jan this is mike we are not interventional cardiologists and there certainly are different skill levels but many comments were stated from the panel which the panel of experts that do highrisk patients and many comments were made by panel members that they wouldnt attempt – or they wouldnt be able to do this case without hemodynamic support so we feel like the interventional cardiology community understands that it isnt just a hemodynamic device its the ability to do complete revascularization and provide for some hemodynamic  stability that allows them to do their best job and i think that thats really something that the interventional cardiology community is celebrating because now they have an option for patients that have heart failure but they can be treated and they can improve their quality of life by being treated with the protected pci and what were doing is trying to get the word out to not just our physicians but to referring physicians and patients and wed encourage all our investors to go to protectedpcicom and they can learn more and they can see clinical data or they can see the information that we have for patients for them to understand the option as well jan d wald  the benchmark co llc okay thank you very much michael john tomsicek  chief financial officer  vice president thanks jan operator our next question comes from the line of shagun singh with sterne agee crt  your line is now open shagun singh chadha  sterne agee crt thank you for taking the question and congratulations on the ongoing momentum unknown speaker thank you shagun singh chadha  sterne agee crt so i guess i was hoping you can provide some commentary with respect to what we can expect upon cp and  approval you mentioned youre already seeing pullthrough from the emergent setting but youre not exactly marketing the cp and  for shock so i was just wondering should we anticipate a significant leg up in growth next summer similar to what we see – or what we saw rather with the   and protected pci any color there would be helpful michael r minogue  chairman president  chief executive officer sure and thank you for your question we were asked that question prior to getting highrisk pci and we stated that we did believe it would be catalyst and it has been our impella emergent patient population has already been experiencing strong growth as you all read and have seen each quarter so is up this quarter  the impella cp is a strong driver of that and so we do expect to see a bump in usage with the pma approval but because this markets been growing quickly we dont think it will be as dramatic because its already in the top tier as a growth driver shagun singh chadha  sterne agee crt got it thank you and then you mentioned that tct was really the first platform where you were able to educate physicians with respect to patient selection can you provide more color on where you are in that education process are you seeing sicker patients being treated just trying to get a sense of who is being treated right now and the pace of adoption michael r minogue  chairman president  chief executive officer so the question it really gets back to our patient population target and it starts with this growing epidemic of heart failure in the united states and again theres lots of statistics and numbers and youre talking about  million class iii class iv patients that have somewhat limited quality of life and when we narrow it down to the  potential patients that are actually getting diagnosed for ischemic disease were really just scratching the surface with only treating a very small percentage and again thats about  as well as much as we have been at the show theres a lot more physicians that dont attend and so were really focused on bringing this training bringing this education to the communities and thats why were doing the mobile learning lab where we pull up to the hospital and the physicians get extra training but also talk to the community about the benefits of protected pci and for those hospitals were essentially bringing the tct floor the technology and the slide decks to them and we think its – it will be very successful in the long term but we have a long way to go shagun singh chadha  sterne agee crt got it and then if i could just squeeze in one last one there was a lot of talk about complete revascularization at tct and i was just wondering to what degree are you seeing that already occur because of impella thank you michael r minogue  chairman president  chief executive officer i think thats the critical question in treating patients the idea of getting in and out is probably not an appropriate treatment therapy for treating some of the sickest patients in the cath lab and in the protect ii study in both arms the patients that had the most extensive revascularization had the lowest adverse event rate so that also matches what youre seeing clinically around in the other clinical studies such as syntax or in general pci studies that the most complete revascularization does tend to yield the best outcomes and thats been one of the benefits of cabg over the years because under a surgical procedure you do get complete revascularization and to our knowledge the protect ii study is the only fda study that has ever shown an improvement in ejection fraction for pci pci historically has had symptom relief but whats very exciting is to see the improvement and the quality of life to see the improvement of more than  reduction in heart classification and were really excited for what that means for the patient shagun singh chadha  sterne agee crt thank you very much operator at this time im showing no further questions i would now like to turn the call back over to michael minogue for closing remarks michael r minogue  chairman president  chief executive officer we just want to say thank you to our investors and your support all these years we have a lot more work to do but were very focused and if theres any followup questions please feel free to call in have a great day
