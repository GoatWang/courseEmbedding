consumerfocused investor with offices in london and los angeles the firm provides investment management services to various investment funds established in the united kingdom the “funds” which focus on making investments in europe and north america as a private equity investor our immediate supply chain is relatively short consisting mainly of professional services firms the funds that we manage invest in a number of portfolio companies though these portfolio companies do not form part of the firm’s supply chain we are committed to taking steps to confirm that each portfolio company’s management team understands any responsibilities it has under the act and the need for it to put in place its own effective controls and training to protect against modern slavery being present in its own business and supply chains to this end we have written to the management of those portfolio companies that we consider may be subject to the act to ensure that they understand their obligations under the act in addition we have representation on each portfolio company board and although not a standing agenda item ensuring compliance with the act and limiting the risk of modern slavery and

we ensure that such portfolio company’s management team is aware of their potential obligations under the act we do not consider that the relationships within our immediate supply chain give rise to material risks in this area however we will be requiring key suppliers to confirm that their activities accord with the requirements of the act we also have a dedicated compliance officer who oversees the above process training the firm has provided details of this policy to all relevant staff we ensure that all employees on joining the firm and periodically thereafter review and familiarise themselves with the firm’s policies to ensure that they can identify situations where there is a risk of modern slavery or human trafficking further steps additional steps that we intend to take in
