commercialscale cgmp manufacturing solutions for more than  cell and advanced therapy companies across the globe we leverage our vast experience and deep understanding of the regenerative medicine market as well as the unique technology and business challenges our clients’ face to design and deliver optimal cgmp manufacturing solutions that integrate offtheshelf equipment and custom systems when needed finding the optimal manufacturing solution we have designed integrated and delivered manufacturing solutions for regenerative medicine and advanced therapies including cellbased immunotherapies gene therapies stem cell and progenitor cellbased therapies primary cellbased therapies whether you’re developing an autologous cart therapy to cure cancer an allogeneic therapy for regenerative medicine or a bioreactor for tissue production – we will work collaboratively with your team to fully understand the therapy and current process this understanding enables us to propose cgmp manufacturing solutions that will not impact the therapy or fundamentally alter the current process we then develop a plan to successfully transition from the clinic to commercialscale and deliver scalable solutions that will ensure a consistent repeatable product while also managing costs of goods and minimizing total cost of treatment why invetech help enable a clear path to fundraising regulatory approval and commercial success having completed over  projects for more than  cell and advanced therapy companies we have the experience required to help develop a plan to successfully transition from clinical trials to commercialscale production having a credible plan developed by an experienced partner will make it easier to raise funds meet major milestones and achieve regulatory approval save time and money by leveraging and integrating offtheshelf modular solutions we deliver a complete cgmp manufacturing solution that best suits the needs of our clients this includes leveraging modular equipment we have developed internally for common unit processes as well as identifying and integrating offtheshelf technologies available in the market for example we can leverage modular equipment we have developed for cell washing and concentration and closed formulation and mixing or we can integrate offtheshelf technologies such as the ge wave for cell expansion or closed bag filling for managing your working cell bank by integrating offtheshelf modular solutions we save our clients’ time and money however by also building custom manufacturing systems when needed we can deliver a complete cgmp manufacturing solution that fits the complexity of the unique therapy and manufacturing process after defining the commercialscale system and critical process technologies we deploy a staged development and implementation strategy that aligns with our clients’ clinical trials schedule and availability of funding our scalable approach helps minimize costs—and risk—while also enabling production capacity to be rapidly increased once the therapy is approved reduce risk maintain product quality and ensure consistent repeatable product we work collaboratively with our clients to develop and refine their manufacturing processes to be robust and errorproof this includes automating manual laboratory processes to eliminate human error optimizing unit process workflows and utilizing closed disposables to enable aseptic processing—all to achieve consistent and repeatable product required for regulatory approval reduce costs by transitioning from a manual process to a closed automated process our cgmp manufacturing solutions deliver significant advantages in terms of scalability reduced cost of therapy and product quality however the most significant cost savings are achieved through the reduction in labor and facility requirements of a closed automated process moving to a closed process using singleuse disposables allows significant savings on clean room costs – reducing the total amount of space required as well as enabling the process to move into lowergrade clean room space which is far less expensive furthermore automation allows the development of a more repeatable and reliable process which will minimize labor requirements—including the number of personnel required and their level of education—resulting in reduced labor training and recruitment costs to give you a general idea of the cost savings that can be achieved the graph below shows the scaleup of an autologous therapy and what happens to the cost per patient for three process scenarios manual and open automated closed unit processes and automated closed and integrated as you can see there is a significant savings—greater than m usd—when using singleuse disposables as part of a complete cgmp manufacturing solution further breakdown shows that the key cost drivers are remarkably consistent across the three process scenarios however through the combination of closed processing process optimization and automation a significant reduction in costs can be achieved get in touch to find out more about
