mortgage bond investors wells fargo could keep more money for legal fees    housingwire home » fitch warns mortgage bond investors wells fargo could keep more money for legal fees investments lending servicing fitch warns mortgage bond investors wells fargo could keep more money for legal fees  billion in rmbs classes now at risk of downgrade july   ben lane keywords fitch fitch ratings mortgage bond performance mortgage bond trustees mortgage bonds residential mortgagebacked security rmbs rmbs ratings wells fargo earlier this month wells fargo unexpectedly kept  million away from residential mortgagebacked securities investors stating that the bank needed the money to cover legal expenses now fitch ratings is warning rmbs investors that wells fargo’s move may not be an isolated incident in fact it may be a harbinger of similar moves to come in the future of the  million that wells fargo held back approximately  million came from  fitchrated rmbs transactions according to fitch’s report the redirection of trust funds by wells fargo resulted in insufficient remaining funds to pay off  fitchrated classes including six classes with investmentgrade ratings which were included in the  rmbs deals fitch reviewed similar rmbs deals and found a significant number that had similar characteristics to the  deals in question those deals therefore are at risk for wells fargo taking similar actions fitch writes as a result of that review fitch placed  rmbs classes from  rmbs transactions on rating watch negative due to the potential for wells fargo to reserve against future expenses the bank may incur to defend itself against litigation according to fitch’s report the outstanding balance on those  rmbs classes is  billion in total fitch said the  classes are at an increased risk for payment disruption in the future which basically means that wells fargo could do it again so each of those classes are under review for rating downgrade wells fargo has indicated that the withheld reserves are intended to cover future expenses related to lawsuits initiated in  by institutional investors who claim they were damaged when wells fargo did not fulfill its obligation as trustee to protect them from defective mortgages fitch writes in its report wells fargos action is notable due to its preemptive nature and due to the magnitude of the amounts withheld fitch also notes that similar legal actions have been taken against all us rmbs trustees – bank of new york mellon citibank deutsche bank us bank hsbc bank – which could mean that those banks could withhold money as well if the conditions deemed it necessary in its report fitch explains why all of this is significant us rmbs transaction documents indemnify trustees against legal expenses incurred except those by reason of willful misfeasance bad faith or gross negligence as determined by a court to date trustees have typically only withheld funds to cover expenses actually incurred or reserves in amounts not large enough to affect credit ratings that all changed when wells fargo elected to withhold that  million with the potential for more that could be coming fitch explains the amount withheld from the  called transactions reflects an assumption by wells fargo of future legal expenses of  per loan originally in the trust plus  for each transaction fitch assumes wells fargo will continue to preemptively redirect trust funds to reserve against future expenses in scenarios where they may not be able to reimburse themselves from the trust in the future such as when a transaction is called or when the remaining pool balance is relatively small and if those conditions are present wells fargo and potentially other rmbs trustees could withhold funds fitch said that it contacted the other five trustees named in similar lawsuits and all five trustees were “unwilling or unable” to provide guidance on whether they intend to employ a strategy similar to wells fargo jp morgans research team has identified four transactions where three trustees other than wells fargo us bank bank of new york mellon and hsbc withheld funds on called transactions fitch notes the amounts were not large enough to affect fitchrated classes and the trustees would not disclose what portion if any was preemptively held for future expenses fitch did note that the legality of wells fargo’s action is expected to be challenged in court so this entire exercise could end up being a moot point but for now rmbs investors are on alert reprints related articles wells fargo withholds

could keep more money for legal fees  billion in rmbs classes now at risk of downgrade july   ben lane keywords fitch fitch ratings mortgage bond performance mortgage bond trustees mortgage bonds residential mortgagebacked security rmbs rmbs ratings wells fargo earlier this month wells fargo unexpectedly kept  million away from residential mortgagebacked securities investors stating that the bank needed the money to cover legal expenses now fitch ratings is warning rmbs investors that wells fargo’s move may not be an isolated incident in fact it may be a harbinger of similar moves to come in the future of the  million that wells fargo held back approximately  million came from  fitchrated rmbs transactions according to fitch’s report the redirection of trust funds by wells fargo resulted in insufficient remaining funds to pay off  fitchrated classes including six classes with investmentgrade ratings which were included in the  rmbs deals fitch reviewed similar rmbs deals and found a significant number that had similar characteristics to the  deals in question those deals therefore are at risk for wells fargo taking similar actions fitch writes as a result of that review fitch placed  rmbs classes from  rmbs transactions on rating watch negative due to the potential for wells fargo to reserve against future expenses the bank may incur to defend itself against litigation according to fitch’s report the outstanding balance on those  rmbs classes is  billion in total fitch said the  classes are at an increased risk for payment disruption in the future which basically means that wells fargo could do it again so each of those classes are under review for rating downgrade wells fargo has indicated that the withheld reserves are intended to cover future expenses related to lawsuits initiated in  by institutional investors who claim they were damaged when wells fargo did not fulfill its obligation as trustee to protect them from defective mortgages fitch writes in its report wells fargos action is notable due to its preemptive nature and due to the magnitude of the amounts withheld fitch also notes that similar legal actions have been taken against all us rmbs trustees – bank of new york mellon citibank deutsche bank us bank hsbc bank – which could mean that those banks could withhold money as well if the conditions deemed it necessary in its report fitch explains why all of this is significant us rmbs transaction documents indemnify trustees against legal expenses incurred except those by reason of willful misfeasance bad faith or gross negligence as determined by a court to date trustees have typically only withheld funds to cover expenses actually incurred or reserves in amounts not large enough to affect credit ratings that all changed when wells fargo elected to withhold that  million with the potential for more that could be coming fitch explains the amount withheld from the  called transactions reflects an assumption by wells fargo of future legal expenses of  per loan originally in the trust plus  for each transaction fitch assumes wells fargo will continue to preemptively redirect trust funds to reserve against future expenses in scenarios where they may not be able to reimburse themselves from the trust in the future such as when a transaction is called or when the remaining pool balance is relatively small and if those conditions are present wells fargo and potentially other rmbs trustees could withhold funds fitch said that it contacted the other five trustees named in similar lawsuits and all five trustees were “unwilling or unable” to provide guidance on whether they intend to employ a strategy similar to wells fargo jp morgans research team has identified four transactions where three trustees other than wells fargo us bank bank of new york mellon and hsbc withheld funds on called transactions fitch notes the amounts were not large enough to affect fitchrated classes and the trustees would not disclose what portion if any was preemptively held for future expenses fitch did note that the legality of wells fargo’s action is expected to be challenged in court so this entire exercise could end up being a moot point but for now rmbs investors are on alert reprints related articles wells fargo withholds  million for legal costs shakes up mortgage bond market blackrock pimco
