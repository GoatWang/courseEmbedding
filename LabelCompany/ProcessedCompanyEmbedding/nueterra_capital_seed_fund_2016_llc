places in commerce is prime we want to help define how people interact with their worlds for the next  years commerce is not as simple as selling things online great commerce is a collection of smart systems and brilliant financial planning longlasting commerce companies are parts operations technology design people and finance the bulk of our partners’ company experience centers around commerce we’ve built products from scratch and at extreme scale we love it we’re excited by the opportunity to help innovative ideas become year companies what is commerce the definition of commerce is broad we believe it to be all aspects of how people buy the things they need and want people’s needs include many types of products tangible and intangible companies that deconstruct inefficient or expensive categories of products are equally as exciting to us as companies figuring out how to make the dying brick and mortar retail world vibrant again what do you do for your portfolio companies what kind of investor are you in a word hustle we are operationallyfocused investors more important than the capital we invest we bring our experience and network and work tirelessly to help you achieve your company’s goals what types of companies does vtf capital invest in our companies see their products as solving a deeprooted problem rather than just making a sale we invest in companies in a variety of industries but get particularly excited about commerce most of our companies create build and sell products experiences and tools that challenge commerce in the physical and digital worlds we invest in early and midstage companies serving consumers and smbs with revenuepositive unit economics often vertically integrated commerce retail technology and saas companies surrounding the commerce space a company we invest in typically generates revenue in one of three ways our experience is that young companies that focus on earning revenue from more than one of these categories experience growth challenges the companies we invest in generally have a unique technical advantage adaptable well beyond the product they sell to the world andor a complete and unique ownership of their supply chain in this way they are more about what you don’t see than what you see commerce – companies that make and sell physical and experiential products to people these companies are often digitalfirst verticallyintegrated firstparty merchants of products that leverage technology to more nimbly manufacture and market their goods define categories of products and for thirdparty retailers categories of shopping produce products that define new product categories distributed at efficient scale have a deep sense of purpose beyond making a sale this is especially important for thirdparty commerce companies have a longterm stair step vision for how to build a large lasting company use complex systems and data analysis to maximize every opportunity to build a longterm business physical commerce – companies that build innovative technology for physical commerce these companies build innovative technologies that enhance physical shopping experiences enable more efficient and innovative use of physical spaces to enable inperson and digital commerce simplify the logistics linking manufacturer retailer and consumer commerce infrastructure – companies building technology products and services that enable greater access and efficiency in commerce these companies build tools to help retail companies build their businesses more efficiently focus on leveraging technology innovation to make commerce simpler more intelligent and more secure what do we not invest in companies directly or indirectly focused on gambling gaming or nightlife entertainment companies especially physical product companies that have not produced and sold a usable mvp to customers whether it be a physical product or an intangible technology product to help companies like this we invested in dragon innovation companies lacking technicallyminded team members or cofounders we’re looking for companies where tech is in your dna do we invest in other types of companies our definition of commerce evolves daily most of our recent investments fit into one of our three focus areas within commerce sometimes an opportunity forces us to rethink our scope we call those investments atypical when do we invest we have always been an early stage investor we invest  to  million in companies over their lifetimes we sometimes lead investments but don’t require that we do so if you’ve raised more than  million you are probably too late for us do we have to be based in las vegas we love las vegas some of us live here as of january   of the investments we’ve made are based here we’ve invested more early stage capital into las vegas companies than any firm in state history we see maximizing our impact as a longterm focus if we can do for las vegas what brad feld did for boulder everyone wins and we can’t do that by only investing in companies with las vegas ties that’s why  of our investments are located elsewhere we’re excited to meet and support companies

administration and marketing basics inc magazine defines seed funding as the earliest round of capital for a startup company fundingsavvy a funding resource website defines earlystage funding as a startup companys first round of substantial funding earlystage funding usually consists of two parts commonly known as series a and series b financing seed funding allows a startup to develop a prototype product and generate sufficient investor interest for successive financing rounds earlystage funding allows additional operational flexibility over the medium to long term sources the sources of seed funding include the founders personal savings and investments from family and friends banks usually do not lend to startup companies because of the high risks and venture capitalists tend to stay away from seed funding however a startup entrepreneur might have more success with angel investors and private equity funds angels are former entrepreneurs and other wealthy investors who get involved in some startup companies private equity funds pool money from individuals and institutions to invest in highgrowth companies earlystage funding typically comes from venture capitalists who may also bring experience and industry contacts that can help a startup rapidly grow its business amounts montrealbased venture capitalist ben yoskovitz suggests that seed funding typically ranges from  to  million a common funding structure is convertible debt which is debt that is exchangeable for stock within a specified period fundingsavvycom suggests that earlystage series a funding is in the  million to  million range while series b funding is in the  million to  million range the highrisk nature of seed funding increases the cost of capital which means that investors may demand a larger share of the startup therefore startups should secure only enough seed funding to continue operations and develop a viable prototype thus preserving enough equity in the company to satisfy the founders and the early investors considerations valuation startup valuation is important because it determines the return on investment if a startup companys valuation were  million before seed funding of  million then the founders and seed investors would each own  percent of the company if the company raises additional funds the founders share would diminish further several ways to

there are no officially set minimums on annual sales to become a client and the seed capital program is stated income however it is of the utmost importance that you are truthful in your statements of business information as banks will be comparing your statements with their own research and due diligence what are the minimum requirements for an entrepreneur to qualify the ceos credit score is by

score then it is likely you will apply the same financial responsibility to your business banks want to see consistent repayment history over time and the stronger your credit is the more they will be

can have a minimal negative impact on the personal credit score for up to  months what types of startups are eligible any type of business is eligible for the seed capital program however businesses
