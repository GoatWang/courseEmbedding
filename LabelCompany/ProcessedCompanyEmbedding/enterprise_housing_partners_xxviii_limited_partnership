crashersaboutpresscontactwrite for usas featured inwhat is a family limited partnership flp – pros  consby kiara ashanti posted in taxesshare tweet pincommentsthe us could experience some rather drastic tax changes in the near future for instance if the socalled buffett rule passes capital gains taxes would increase from  to  for those with incomes above  or  those with a  million in hard assets another looming tax hike are the bush tax cuts that are set to expire in  pushing rates up for many americanswhile these two tax alterations are not set in stone one sure thing to consider is that the estate tax will be returning to  from the current rates of  and the amount you can exclude from your estate for tax purposes will be reduced from  million to the  rate of  million when a valuable inheritance is rich in land but light in cash paying more than half your inheritance is a greater burden especially if you have to sell the property to pay the taxesif you are a business owner you must plan ahead for any of these potential tax eventualities the buffett rule may never transpire but estate taxes will not go away and there’s a good chance that the bush tax cuts will expire or be alteredbut how do you plan for changes in the tax code that have not happened yet – or might not happen at all it’s simple focus on financial instruments and entities that will allow you to protect your assets and mitigate changes in the tax code if you have a business that involves family members or a business or assets that you want to leave to your family then one such entity is the family limited partnership flpwhat is a family limited partnershipa family limited partnership is a partnership agreement that exists between family members who are actively involved in a trade or business the partnership divides rights to income appreciation and control among the family members according to the family’s overall objectivesthe family “business” does not actually have to be a business in the traditional sense – assets such as real estate or investments can also be in a flp as can the family farm ranch or real estate holdings the nature of the flp allows you to shift the value of assets to other members thereby reducing the size of the estate for certain membersa family as defined for tax purposes only includes a person’s spouse children ancestors including parents lineal descendants grandchildren and any other trusts established for the benefit of those people so for example a newly married spouse could be part of the partnership but not a second cousinthe most common way of setting up an flp is to create a general partnership first with limited partnership interests the general partner or partners then gift the limited partnership interest to the children or other family members who are eligible whomever holds the general partner title maintains control over the enterprise or assets but the limited partnership interest lets children or other eligible family memberships share in the ownershipthis is probably where the concept of not mixing family with business originated business interests are ripe for family conflict so why would anyone create an flp and risk family strifeadvantages of flps estate planning is simple and estate tax savings are substantial the flp is a frequentlyused technique to shift income tax burdens from parents to children as an estate planning tool the interests transferred to your children including all appreciation since the transfer escape inclusion in your estate when you die only the value of the taxable gifts at the time they were transferred into the flp are included for purposes of estate taxesfor example if the value of the partner interests are valued at  but in  years rise to a value of  million only the  amount would be included in the estate for the purposes of estate planning this can lead to estate tax savings down the road transferring of ownership is systematic if a business is a sole proprietorship at the death of the owner the value of the business is included in the value of the estate if it is set up as a corporation again the value of the shares of the corporation is fully in the value of the estatean flp however allows the owner to set up family members as limited partners and allow them to transfer partnership interests over time this results in a gradual systematic transfer of ownership the value of the partnership interests is not included in the value of the estate of the general partner when he dies there are significant income tax benefits aside from the estate planning advantages the family limited partnership can lead to substantial income tax savings by including your children as partners and sharing partnership income with them total family taxes may be reduced because your children as limited partners own part of the companyfor example most small businesses in the country are set up as subchapter s corporations this setup allows owners to take the profits of the corporation and pass them on as personal income to the owners – and this is the reason many in congress oppose higher taxes on the  per year income threshold if however you choose to set up an flp the general partner can share the income with his two kids he may pay each  reducing his income for tax purposes to  not there is however an important caveat here you cannot shift income to children younger than  in the old days this was a favored tactic of the rich and infamous rich fathers and uncles would put the fiveyear old on the payroll and pay him  million that is a nono in today’s world for any child younger than  any income over  will be taxed at the top marginal rate of his parentsdisadvantages of flps children may be exposed to major capital gains liability gifted property does not receive the steppedup basis treatment that bequeathed property receives the term “steppedup” refers to the value of an asset when a person dies and leaves the asset to an heir for example an uncle buys  shares of apple stock when it is only  per share he dies and leaves it to his favorite niece the value of the apple stock and what the niece gains or loses is based on the market price on the day she took ownership not the price the uncle paid this is important because if it were based on the latter amount her capital gains liability would be steepin an flp however this may not be the case and children may be exposed to significant capital gains liability this varies depending on the type of property being transferred and what has happened to it it’s always best to discuss with an attorney potential capital gains issues – and it’s always important to remember that property in an flp does not have the same steppedup value basis as property left to heirs general partners could be at risk unlike corporations and trusts general partners are not insulated from potential lawsuits judgments or creditor seizures the parents as general partners are  in control of the assets and  responsible for a potential lawsuit general partners have no asset protection in these cases it can be difficult to transfer ownership to children under  flps are not the best entity for transferring assets or business interest to family members who are under the age of  first of all  the minor’s interest would have to be held by a parent or guardian second partners must be able to play a role in the daytoday management and operations of the business this also makes partnership interest unsuitable for family members who are older than  but are away in college nonbusiness assets could become large tax liabilities if the flp you have or will create is for the sole purpose of nonbusiness assets such as real estate or investment securities then you must be careful – you could find the flp to be considered an investment company this may cause capital gains and therefore losses realized on the transfer of property into the partnershipfor instance a beach house owned by a grandfather and grandmother increases in value from  to  million if the flp is labeled as an investment company then transferring ownership of the beach house to the flp could create a capital gain of just under  million and a tax bill of approximately  dollars if you only have one type of property then other type of trusts are better suited to avoid large tax liabilitiesfinal wordthe scenario just described is not one that normally happens under partnership rules but it can despite that the benefits of the family limited partnership can be significant – but only if set up correctlywhen dealing with any type of estate planning strategy using an attorney in conjunction with a financial advisor is a must speak with more than one flps are the favorite of attorneys while investment professionals and cpas sometimes like to use other estate planning tools such as trusts limited liability companies or partnerships setting up an flp can cost anywhere between  to  dollars with ongoing costs after setup given the costs getting a second or even third opinion in this area is a smart move worth the extra effort and timephoto credit bigstockrelatedk views
