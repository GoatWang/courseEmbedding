orthodox or unorthodox as the mood took him his record in a long career is outstanding but all who saw him play regularly seem agreed that he should have scored even more runs than he did  his test career was an unusual one all but one of his  tests being outside england he was not selected for the 9 tour of australia but visited the country anyway for the good of his health it was arranged that he could be called upon by england if necessary in the event it was necessary and he appeared in the first test at sydney scores of 9 in his first innings in test cricket and  ensured that he would play in all five tests he made another century  in the fifth test also at sydney he topped the averages with  runs at  he was only chosen for one test in englands home series against australia in 99 making  and  in the second test at lords but toured again in 9 though not quite as successful as four years earlier he made  runs at  after world war i he was out of favour and his final four tests

cricketing family being a younger brother of john gunn and a nephew of william gunn both of whom also played test cricket and the father of g v gunn he scored  not out on his fiftieth birthday  june
