the partnership does not engage in sales of goods or services its assets are its i equity in trading account consisting of restricted and unrestricted cash net unrealized appreciation on open futures contracts net unrealized appreciation on open forward contracts and investment in us treasury bills at fair value if applicable ii cash at bank and iii interest receivable because of the low margin deposits normally required in commodity futures trading relatively small price movements may result in substantial losses to the partnership while substantial losses could lead to a material decrease in liquidity no such illiquidity occurred in the first quarter of  the partnerships investment in futures interests may from time to time be illiquid most us futures exchanges limit fluctuations in prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily price fluctuation limits or daily limits trades may not be executed at prices beyond the daily limit if the price for a particular futures or option contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit positions in that futures or option contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading these market conditions could prevent the partnership from promptly liquidating its futures or option contracts and result in restrictions on redemptions there is no limitation on daily price movements in trading forward contracts on foreign currencies the markets for some world currencies have low trading volume and are illiquid which may prevent the partnership from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the partnership from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such markets subjecting it to substantial losses either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on redemptions for the periods covered by this report illiquidity has not materially affected the partnerships assets other than the risks inherent in commodity futures forward options swaps and other derivatives trading and us treasury bills and money market mutual fund securities the partnership knows of no trends demands commitments events or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to result in the partnerships liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way the partnerships capital consists of the capital contributions of the partners as increased or decreased by net realized andor unrealized gains or losses on trading and by expenses interest income and redemptions of units for the three months ended march   partnership capital decreased  from  to  this decrease was attributable to redemptions of  limited partners units totaling  and a net loss of  future redemptions can impact the amount of funds available for investments in subsequent periods other than as discussed above there are no known material trends favorable or unfavorable that would affect nor any expected material changes to the partnerships capital resource arrangements at the present time offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the partnership does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements nor does it have contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments that would affect its liquidity or capital resources critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the general partner to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting period the general partner believes that the estimates utilized in preparing the financial statements are reasonable actual results could differ from those estimates the partnerships significant accounting policies are described in detail in note  basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies of the financial statements the partnership records all investments at fair value in their financial statements with changes in fair value reported as a component of net realized gains losses and net change in unrealized gains losses in the statements of income and expenses results of operations the partnerships results depend on the trading advisor and the ability of the trading advisors trading program to take advantage of price movements in the futures forward and options markets the trading advisor trades the partnerships assets in accordance with its diversified program a proprietary systematic trading system the diversified program is a proprietary systematic global futures trading program its goal is the generation of significant longterm capital growth independent of stock and bond market returns this program continuously monitors price movements in a wide range of global financial currency and commodity markets searching for profit opportunities over periods ranging from a few hours to several months the trading advisor has designed the diversified program to have broad market diversification subject to liquidity constraints aspects quantitative resources are sufficient to enable it to design and implement a broadly diversified portfolio with a significant allocation to numerous different markets the trading advisors diversified program trades over  markets in the seven major sectors currencies energy metals stock indices bonds agricultural commodities and interest rates implementing momentum strategies aspect is constantly examining new liquid and uncorrelated markets to incorporate in the program with the aim of improving its rewardrisk ratio and capacity aspect has no market or sector preferences believing that allowing for liquidity effects equal profitability can be achieved in the longterm in all markets the key factors in determining the asset allocation are correlation and liquidity correlations are analyzed at the sector subsector economic block and market levels to design a portfolio which is highly diversified the following presents a summary of the partnerships operations for the three months ended march   and  and a general discussion of its trading activities during each period it is important to note however that the trading advisor trades in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the trading advisor or will be profitable in the future consequently the results of operations of the partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of the trading advisors trading activities on behalf of the partnership during the period in question past performance is no guarantee of future results the partnerships results of operations set forth in the financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which require the use of certain accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements including the following the contracts the partnership trades are accounted for on a tradedate basis and marked to market on a daily basis the difference between their original contract value and market value is recorded in the statements of income and expenses as net change in unrealized gains losses on open contracts on open contracts and recorded as net realized gains losses on closed contracts when open positions are closed out the sum of these amounts constitutes the partnerships trading results the market value of a futures contract is the settlement price on the exchange on which that futures contract is traded on a particular day the value of a foreign currency forward contract is based on the spot rate as of approximately  pm et the close of the business day interest income as well as management fees incentive fees general partner fees and ongoing placement agent fees of the partnership are recorded on an accrual basis the general partner believes that based on the nature of the operations of the partnership no assumptions relating to the application of critical accounting policies other than those presently used could reasonably affect reported amounts during the partnerships first quarter of  the net asset value per unit decreased  from  to  as compared to a decrease of  during the first quarter of  the partnership experienced a net trading loss before fees

offset by gains in the equity sector the partnership experienced a net trading gain before fees and expenses in the first quarter of  of  gains were primarily attributable to the partnerships trading of futures interests in the commodity and interest rates sectors and were partially offset by losses in the equity and currencies sectors the most significant losses were incurred within the global interest rate markets primarily during january and march from long positions in european and us fixed income futures as prices declined amid speculation of growing hawkish sentiment in central banks

operations liquidity the partnership deposits its assets with msco as its clearing commodity broker in separate futures forward and options trading accounts established for the trading advisor such assets are used as margin to engage in trading and may be used as margin solely for the partnerships trading the assets are held either in noninterest bearing bank accounts or in securities and instruments permitted by the cftc for investment of customer segregated or secured funds since the partnerships sole purpose is to trade in futures interests it is expected that the partnership will continue to own such liquid assets for margin purposes the partnerships investment in futures interests and us treasury bills may from time to time be illiquid most us futures exchanges limit fluctuations in prices during a single day by regulations referred to as daily price fluctuation limits or daily limits trades may not be executed at prices beyond the daily limit if the price for a particular futures or option contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit positions in that futures or option contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading these market conditions could prevent the partnership from promptly liquidating its futures or option contracts and result in restrictions on redemptions there is no limitation on daily price movements in trading forward contracts on foreign currencies the markets for some world currencies have low trading volume and are illiquid which may prevent the partnership from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the partnership from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such markets subjecting it to substantial losses either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on redemptions for the periods covered by this report illiquidity has not materially affected the partnerships assets there are no known material trends demands commitments events or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to result in the partnerships liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way capital resources the partnership does not have nor does it expect to have any capital assets the partnerships only assets are its equity in trading accounts consisting of a cash on deposit with msco a portion of which is to be used as margin for trading b net unrealized gains or losses on futures and forward contracts which calculated as the difference between the original contract value and fair value and c us treasury bills at fair value redemptions of units in the future will affect the amount of funds available for investments in futures interests and us treasury bills in subsequent periods it is not possible to estimate the amount and therefore the impact of future outflows of units there are no known material trends favorable or unfavorable that would affect nor any expected material changes to the partnerships capital resource arrangements at the present time the general partner estimates that at any given time approximately  to  of the partnerships contracts are traded otc results of operations general the partnerships results depend on the trading advisor and the ability of the trading advisors trading program to take advantage of price movements in the futures forward and options markets the trading advisor trades the partnerships assets in accordance with its diversified program a proprietary systematic trading system the diversified program is a proprietary systematic global futures trading program its goal is the generation of significant longterm capital growth independent of stock and bond market returns this program continuously monitors price movements in a wide range of global financial currency and commodity markets searching for profit opportunities over periods ranging from a few hours to several months the trading advisor has designed the diversified program to have broad market diversification subject to liquidity constraints aspects quantitative resources are sufficient to enable it to design and implement a broadly diversified portfolio with a significant allocation to numerous different markets the trading advisors diversified program trades over  markets in the seven major sectors currencies energy metals stock indices bonds agricultural commodities and interest rates implementing momentum strategies aspect is constantly examining new liquid and uncorrelated markets to incorporate in the program with the aim of improving its rewardrisk ratio and capacity aspect has no market or sector preferences believing that allowing for liquidity effects equal profitability can be achieved in the longterm in all markets the key factors in determining the asset allocation are correlation and liquidity correlations are analyzed at the sector subsector economic block and market levels to design a portfolio which is highly diversified the following presents a summary of the partnerships operations for the years ended december    and  and a general discussion of its trading activities during each period it is important to note however that the trading advisor trades in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the trading advisor or will be profitable in the future consequently the results of operations of the partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of the trading advisors trading activities on behalf of the partnership during the period in question past performance is no guarantee of future results the partnerships results of operations set forth in the financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap which require the use of certain accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements including the following the contracts the partnership trades are accounted for on a tradedate basis and marked to market on a daily basis the difference between their original contract value and market value is recorded in the statements of income and expenses as net change in unrealized gains losses on open contracts and recorded as net realized gains losses on closed contracts when open positions are closed out the sum of these amounts constitutes the partnerships trading results the market value of a futures contract is the settlement price on the exchange on which that futures contract is traded on a particular day the value of a foreign currency forward contract is extrapolated on a forward basis from the prices quoted as of approximately  pm et the close of the business day interest income as well as management fees incentive fees brokerage fees general partner fees and ongoing placement agent fees of the partnership are recorded on an accrual basis the general partner believes that based on the nature of the operations of the partnership no assumptions relating to the application of critical accounting policies other than those presently used could reasonably affect reported amounts no forecast can be made as to the level of redemptions in any given period a limited partner may require the partnership to redeem its units at the net asset value per unit as of the end of any month on the last business days notice to the general partner there is no fee charged to limited partners in connection with redemptions redemptions generally are funded out of the partnerships cash holdings for the year ended december    limited

december   the net asset value per unit increased  from  to  the partnership experienced a net trading loss of  before fees and expenses for the year ended december   losses were primarily attributable to the partnerships trading of futures interests in the commodity equity and currencies sectors and were partially offset by gains in the interest rates sector the net trading gain or loss realized from the partnership is disclosed under item  financial statements and supplementary data the most significant losses were recorded in the metals sector primarily during february march and april from short positions in gold and silver futures as prices advanced amid increased investor demand for precious metals further losses in the metals sector were incurred throughout the first quarter from positions in zinc futures losses within the metals during august were experienced from long positions in silver futures as prices moved lower due to weakening investor demand additional losses were recorded in metals during october and december from short and long futures positions in industrial metals within the currency sector losses were incurred during february from short positions in the swiss franc and japanese yen versus the us dollar as the relative value of the us dollar weakened amid concern of growing vulnerability of the us economy further losses within this sector were recorded during march from short positions in the korean won euro swiss franc and canadian dollar as the relative value of the us dollar weakened following dovish comments from us federal reserve chair janet yellen that pushed out expectations for an interest rate hike by the us central bank additional losses within this sector were recorded during may from long positions in the australian dollar versus the us dollar as the relative value of the us currency rallied after hawkish comments from the us federal reserve during november losses in the currencies were recorded from long positions in the australian dollar versus the us dollar as the relative value of the two currencies diverged amid weak economic data in australia and speculation the incoming us presidential administration would spur economic growth within the agricultural sector losses were experienced during january from long cocoa futures positions after betterthanexpected supplies from west africa prospects of waning chocolate demand and a broader commodity market selloff sent cocoa futures prices lower further losses in this sector were incurred during march from short coffee futures positions as prices were boosted by a combination of a stronger brazilian real and concerns regarding dry weather in colombian and brazilian coffee growing regions during july losses incurred within this sector were from long soybean futures positions as prices decreased amid reports the us crop remained in good to excellent condition during october losses were experienced from short cattle futures positions as prices increased following a low recorded number of the animals in feedlots during november losses were incurred from long coffee futures positions as prices decreased after forecasts of south american supplies increased and the weakening relative value of the brazilian real dampened the markets outlook further losses in the agricultural markets were recorded during december from long positions in soybean futures as prices declined the partnerships trading losses for the year were partially offset by trading gains within the global interest rate sector during january and february

energy complex the russian ruble crisis and uncertainty in european monetary policy all fueled a general risk reduction in stocks for an analysis of unrealized gains and losses by contract type and a further description of  trading results refer to the partnerships annual report to limited partners for the year ended december   which is incorporated by reference to exhibit  of this form k the partnerships gains and losses are allocated among its partners for income tax purposes offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the partnership does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements nor does it have contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments that would affect its liquidity or capital resources market risk the partnership is a party to financial instruments with elements of offbalance sheet market and credit risk the partnership trades futures contracts options on futures contracts and forward contracts on physical commodities and other commodity interests including but not limited to foreign currencies financial instruments metals energy and agricultural products in entering into these contracts the partnership is subject to the market risk that such contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions such as interest rate volatility resulting in such contracts being less valuable if the markets should move against all of the positions held by the partnership at the same time and the trading advisor was unable to offset positions of the partnership the partnership could lose all of its assets and the limited partners would realize a loss equal to  of their capital accounts in addition to the trading advisors internal controls the trading advisor must comply with the partnerships trading policies that include standards for liquidity and leverage that must be maintained the trading advisor and ceres monitor the partnerships trading activities to ensure compliance with the trading policies and ceres can require the trading advisor to modify positions of the partnership if ceres believes they violate the partnerships trading policies credit risk in addition to market risk in entering into futures forward and option contracts there is a credit risk to the partnership that the counterparty on a contract will not be able to meet its obligations to the partnership the ultimate counterparty or guarantor of the partnership for futures forward and option contracts traded in the us and most foreign exchanges on which the partnership trades is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange in general a clearinghouse is backed by the membership of the exchange and will act in the event of nonperformance by one of its members or one of its members customers which should significantly reduce this credit risk there is no assurance that a clearinghouse exchange or other exchange member will meet its obligations to the partnership and ceres and the commodity brokers will not indemnify the partnership against a default by such parties further the law is unclear as to whether a commodity broker has any obligation to protect its customers from loss in the event of an exchange or clearinghouse defaulting on trades effected for the brokers customers in cases where the partnership trades offexchange forward contracts with a counterparty the sole recourse of the partnership will be the forward contracts counterparty ceres deals with these credit risks of the partnership in several ways first ceres monitors the partnerships credit exposure to each exchange on a daily basis the commodity brokers inform the partnership as with all of their customers of the partnerships net margin requirements for all of its existing open positions and ceres has installed a system which permits it to monitor the partnerships potential net credit exposure exchange by exchange by adding the unrealized trading gains on each exchange if any to the partnerships margin liability thereon second the partnerships trading policies limit the amount of its net assets that can be committed at any given time to futures contracts and require a minimum amount of diversification in the partnerships trading usually over several different products and exchanges historically the partnerships exposure to any one exchange has typically amounted to only a small percentage of its total net assets and on those relatively few occasions where the partnerships credit exposure climbs above such level ceres deals with the situation on a case by case basis carefully weighing whether the increased level of credit exposure remains appropriate material changes to the trading policies may be made only with the prior written approval of the limited partners owning more than  of units then outstanding third with respect to forward contract trading the partnership trades with only those counterparties which ceres together with msco has determined to be creditworthy the partnership presently deals with msco as the sole counterparty on all trading of foreign currency forward contracts for additional information see note  financial instruments under notes to financial statements in the partnerships annual report to limited partners for the year ended december   which is incorporated by reference to exhibit  of this form k inflation has not been a major factor in the partnerships operations critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the general partner to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period as a result actual results could differ from these estimates a summary of the partnerships significant accounting policies is described in note  to the partnerships financial statements which is incorporated by reference to exhibit  of this form k the partnerships most significant accounting policy is the valuation of its investments in futures interests and us treasury bills as applicable the fair value of exchangetraded futures option and forward contracts is determined by the various exchanges and reflects the settlement price for each contract as of the close of business on the last business day of the reporting period the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of approximately  pm et on the last business day of the reporting period from various exchanges the fair value of nonexchangetraded foreign currency option contracts is calculated by applying an industry standard model application for options valuation of foreign currency options using as inputs the spot prices interest rates and option implied volatilities quoted as of approximately  pm et on the last business day of the reporting period us treasury bills are valued at the last available bid prices received from independent pricing services as of the close of the last business day of the reporting period item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the partnership is a commodity pool engaged primarily in the speculative trading of futures interests the marketsensitive instruments held by the partnership are acquired for speculative trading purposes only and as a result all or substantially all of the partnerships assets are at risk of trading loss unlike an operating company the risk of marketsensitive instruments is inherent to the primary business activity of the partnership the futures interests traded by the partnership involve varying degrees of related market risk market risk is often dependent upon changes in the level or volatility of interest rates exchange rates and prices of financial instruments and commodities factors that result in frequent changes in the fair value of the partnerships open positions and consequently in its earnings whether realized or unrealized and cash flow gains and losses on open positions of exchangetraded futures and exchangetraded forward contracts are settled daily through variation margin gains and losses on offexchangetraded forward currency contracts and forward currency option contracts are settled    mar   c  cybernet

following changes are also being made to the funds fee and interest payment structure the brokerage commission will now be charged at a monthly flat rate fee equal to  of net assets on an annualized

rate the fund will receive interest income on  of its assets up from  the quarterly incentive fee has been changed from  to  of fund trading profits as a consequence of these changes the funds net recurring costs based on its average volume of trading and on current interest rates will be reduced by approximately  to a breakeven point of  from  we believe that the reduction of net recurring costs and the simultaneous increase in incentive fee better align the funds fee structure toward the objective of future profitability the specifics of these and other changes are set forth in the funds prospectus dated october   a copy of which you should have already received under separate cover in order for the net asset value of the funds units to be more in line with the net asset values of the other charter series funds which were initially issued at  per unit the funds units will be split to effective with the november   monthly closing this will not result in any change in

monthly report of the trading manager october  the fund increased in value during october primarily as a result of gains recorded in the currency markets gains were recorded from short positions in the swiss franc the euro and swedish krona as the value of these currencies weakened versus the us dollar and british pound amid the absence of additional central bank intervention trading profits were also recorded in the currency sector from short south african rand positions as its value trended lower due to a bomb blast in cape town a weaker euro as well as instability in the middle east and zimbabwe additional gains were recorded from short positions in the australian dollar as its value weakened relative to the us dollar following the decline of the european currencies profits were also recorded in the currency markets from short japanese yen positions as the value of the yen decreased following the release of trade data and deflation figures as well as the bankruptcy of a japanese life insurance company which further exacerbated the state of bankruptcy debt in japan a portion of these gains was offset by losses experienced in the energy global interest rate and metals futures markets losses resulted from long crude oil positions as prices dropped during midmonth after saudi arabia said opec could boost output again if prices remained too high in global interest rate futures losses were recorded from long german bund and us treasury bond futures positions as prices fell back after trending higher previously smaller losses were recorded from long copper futures positions as prices declined early in the month after concerns mounted that demand would weaken amid a cooling of the us economy we appreciate your continued investment in morgan stanley dean
