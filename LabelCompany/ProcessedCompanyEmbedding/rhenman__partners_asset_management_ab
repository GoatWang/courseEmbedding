autumn we will also initiate marketing activities outside the nordic region once we have built an even longer track record as well as having increased assets under management to a level where large international institutions can allocate to the fund at the moment almost all our assets are from private clients but we expect inflows within the coming months from institutional clients so the split between institutional and private clients will end up being roughly  hw what is your investment process hr the stockpicking investment process is mainly focused on analysis of the newsflow relating to products as the profitability of the healthcare industry is largely determined by the sales of individual highmargin products besides regular company reports the newsflow consists of scientific data as well as regulatory and commercial events the competitive landscape is of particular importance as the medical field is dynamic the newsflow also has to be translated into valuation metrics and be riskadjusted a scientific advisory board is a seamless part of the investment process to ensure the proper integration of scientific and commercial aspects hw how do you generate ideas for your fund hr ideas are generated mainly through the analysis of newsflow but also through valuation screening the universe listed companies with a market cap exceeding usdm consists of approximately  companies which are systematically followed hw what is your approach to managing risk hr the risk management system consists of three parts liquidity  per cent of the portfolio should be very liquid in essence realisable in one trading day a stoploss function a  per cent decline in net asset value in a calendar month will trigger a riskadjustment process to maximum  per cent net exposure and  per cent gross and a daily value at risk limit of  per cent  per cent confidence interval the net exposure over time will likely be between  and  per cent but may be outside this range hw how has your recent performance compared with your expectations and track record do you expect your performance or style to change going forward hr the fund was recently launched and the strategy is longshort equity so compared with my previously managed funds i now have the possibility to invest in a lot more instruments as well as being able to modify the net and gross exposure depending on my market outlook hw what opportunities are you looking at right now hr extremely low expectations and low valuations combined with perceived political risk that may not be easily quantified makes the sector very interesting as politics is seldom the turning points for fundamentals the most likely outcome of healthcare reform in the us is higher consumption because a major motive of reform is to insure the uninsured healthcare expenditures as a proportion of gdp are likely to continue to expand somewhat in the us and significantly elsewhere hw what events do you expect to see in your sector in the year ahead hr we see continued stable performance in most subsectors political headlines can disturb but also create buying opportunities hw how will these developments affect your own portfolio hr the portfolio is very much focused on companies with unique products less affected by healthcare reform initiatives hw are investors expectations moving towards capital preservation if so how do you deal with this hr capital preservation strategies are positive for the fund as many healthcare investors appreciate the longshort capability which aims to enhance performance and lower risk in times when the overall market is going down or sideways hw what differentiates you from other managers in your sector cg few fund managers have more than a decade of sector experience this fund manager has managed healthcare funds for more than fifteen years and is one of the worlds most experienced healthcare fund managers and according to the bloomberg system has the very best track record with one of the funds being up nearly  per cent in nine years the manager has also received awards such as best global equity fund from the financial times best european pharmaceutical fund from lipper and best healthcare fund manager from dagens industri the asset management firm has also established a renowned scientific advisory board chaired by professor bertil hållsten the companys board members include professor hans wigzell former principal of the karolinska institute and former chairman of kis nobel prize committee and håkan åström former chief executive of kabi pharmacia hw do you foresee problems in raising mandates from investors through  if so what factors will drive investors back to your fund cg one has to be very humble in these types of markets and understand fund investors challenging task to allocate assets among a vast range of investment opportunities but i think we will definitely profit from having an extremely experienced fund manager with a superior track record and the fact that we are active in one single sector as opposed to generalists increases the likelihood of good future returns and thereby our relative attractiveness in the market hw do you have any plans for other product launches in the near future cg we want to focus  per cent on making rhenman healthcare equity ls a great success so we do not foresee any other product launches in the near
