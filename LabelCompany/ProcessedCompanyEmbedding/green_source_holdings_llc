management team careers our business what we do technology faqs applications coal liquefaction oil sands extraction oil sands extraction gses patented liquex® technology can be utilized to extract bituminous organic matter from mined oil sands tar sands the liquex® process is conducted by mixing oil sands with gses proprietary solvent gsx® at this time gsx® extracts and dissolves mainly bituminous material ie hydrocarbons as well as other organic matter from the oil sands the resultant mixture undergoes solidliquid separation to produce a liquid stream and particulate solids the liquid stream generally consists of gsx® bituminous organic matter and water that is inherently present in oil sands depending on the specific oil sands feedstock a fraction of heavy metals andor minerals ie pollutants may transfer to the liquid extract mixture if necessary any pollutants present can be treated with relative ease gsx® is separated from the bitumen via distillation for future use in the process the particulate solids are comprised of sand clay trace amounts of bitumen and various pollutants the liquex® technology greatly diminishes the environmental impact of extracting bitumen from mined oil sands because the process does not require water to perform extraction water is only used to conduct equipment operations necessary during the process eg water boiler for steam generation compared to other available technologies that use a large quantity of water during extraction eg  barrels water per barrel bitumen recovered the liquex® process eliminates the need for tailing ponds gses proprietary solvent is also effective at ambient temperature while other technologies require water heated to high temperatures which translates to utility cost savings for producers using the liquex® technology gses technology is feasible to extract bitumen from both lowgrade and highgrade oil sands whereas other technologies cannot process lower grade oil sands economically thirdparty laboratory testing has demonstrated recovery rates up to  using the liquex® hydrocarbon extraction process the recovered bitumen is representative of a heavy synthetic crude oil that can be marketed as one or more of the following products heavy fuel oil blend fuel for electric power generation via direct combustion refiner feedstock to produce transportation fuels and asphalt base to produce asphalt binder for oil sands producers the potential benefits of gses technology include the following maximizing bitumen extraction including from lower grade oil sands minimizing water requirements reducing energy requirements significantly reducing extraction time enhancing the environmental sustainability of the extraction process by substantially decreasing the emission of pollutants and the generation of greenhouse gases thus resulting in a low carbon footprint operating a process capable of remedying the existing tailing ponds with concomitant recovery of additional bitumen enabling producers to establish an economically compelling process in light of the recyclability of the reagent as well as the relative simplicity of the technology and eliminating the need for diluent to facilitate the transport of extracted bitumen due to the viscosityreducing property of the reagent go back to applications page home  privacy notice  terms and conditions  site

our values management team careers our business what we do technology faqs applications coal liquefaction oil sands extraction frequently asked questions q what does gses liquex® technology do a gses patented liquex® technology offers a lowtech economically viable and environmentally sustainable process for hydrocarbon extraction and recovery using a proprietary reagent gsx® gsx® has been demonstrated to be highly effective in liquefying solubilizing andor extracting bituminous matter in hydrocarbons including coal oil sands and crude oil without the aid of any catalyst promoter andor surfactant q how does the liquex® technology work a gses liquex® technology is based on an extraction taking place when the reagent for the technology and organic matter mainly comprising hydrocarbons come into direct contact with each other at which time the organic matter dissolves into the reagent the exsitu process is conducted by blending a hydrocarboncontaining substance eg coal oil sands with gsx® in a mixing vessel to perform extraction the gsx® extract mixture subsequently undergoes solidliquid separation to produce a liquid stream and a solid residue the resulting liquid stream is subjected to liquidliquid separation eg distillation to recover the target hydrocarbons as well as the gsx® for future use in the process q how does the liquex® technology compare to alternative technologies a gses technology is based on an extraction whereas many alternative technologies are based on a physical dissolution as a result gses process is highly efficient and effective the technology is also lowtech and lowseverity making it relatively easy to implement under or near ambient conditions and requiring less utility resources than many alternatives gses technology is also versatile capable of being implemented both in situ and ex situ across a wide spectrum of hydrocarbon containing materials q why does gses liquex® technology work better than alternative technologies a the proprietary reagents are recyclable low in toxicity and volatility and less costly compared to other known liquefaction solubilization andor extraction reagents for hydrocarbons the proprietary reagent penetrates or diffuses into particles pieces blocks or chunks of hydrocarboncontaining substances through their pores at appreciable rates subsequently releasing the liquefiable solubilizable or extractable fraction in them often almost completely even under or near ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure q is there a limited supply of gsx® a ample quantities of feedstock for gsx® is produced worldwide every year q what are the benefits of gses technology for coal producers a for coal production the benefits of gses technology include expanding the marketability of coal including lower grade coal by yielding two higher valueadded products liquefying coal directly without the aid of a catalyst promoter andor surfactant removing the risk of operating coalliquefaction plants under extremely high temperature and pressure enhancing the environmental sustainability of the liquefaction process lowering capital and operating costs compared to alternative coal liquefaction technologies enabling producers to establish an economically compelling process in light of the recyclability of the reagent as well as the relative simplicity of the technology and minimizing the required utilities and carbon footprint from the process q what are the benefits of gses technology for oil sands producers a for oil sands production the benefits of this technology include maximizing bitumen extraction including from lower grade oil sands minimizing water requirements reducing energy requirements significantly reducing extraction time enhancing the environmental sustainability of the extraction process by substantially decreasing the emission of pollutants and the generation of greenhouse gases thus resulting in a low carbon footprint operating a process capable of remedying the existing tailing ponds with concomitant recovery of additional bitumen enabling producers to establish an economically compelling process in light of the recyclability of the reagent as well as the relative simplicity of the technology and eliminating the need for diluent to facilitate the transport of extracted bitumen due to the viscosityreducing property of the reagent q how does gses liquex® technology work for coal liquefaction a ground coal is blended with gses proprietary solvent gsx® in a simple mixing vessel at ambient pressure and temperature to dissolve bituminous material as well as other organic matter from the coal the resultant mixture undergoes solidliquid separation to produce a liquid stream and particulate solids the liquid stream generally consists of gsx® coal derived liquid cdl and moisture from the coal depending on the specific coal feedstock a fraction of heavy metals andor minerals ie pollutants may transfer to the liquid extract mixture if necessary any pollutants present can be treated with relative ease gsx® is separated from cdl via distillation for future use in the process the particulate solids comprises material originally present in the mined coal less the cdl the majority of moisture and any pollutants not removed during extraction the process results in two potentially higher value added products  a coal derived liquid comprised mainly of hydrocarbons and  a low moisture solid coal q how does gses liquex® technology work for oil sands a oil sands is blended with gses proprietary solvent gsx® in a simple mixing vessel at ambient pressure and temperature to dissolve bituminous organic matter from the oil sands the resultant mixture undergoes solidliquid separation to produce a liquid stream and particulate solids the liquid stream generally consists of gsx® bituminous organic matter and water that is inherently present in oil sands depending on the specific oil sands feedstock a fraction of heavy metals andor minerals ie pollutants may transfer to the liquid extract mixture if necessary any pollutants present can be treated with relative ease gsx® is separated from the recovered bitumen via distillation for future use in the process the particulate solids are comprised of sand clay trace amounts of bitumen and any pollutants not removed during extraction gses technology is feasible to extract bitumen from both lowgrade and highgrade oil sands whereas other technologies cannot process lower grade oil sands economically ie value of bitumen recovered using conventional technologies cannot offset production costs q are there any environmental issues associated with gses technology a under the federal laws and regulations of the united states gse does not anticipate that storage use or disposal of the proprietary reagent gsx® would trigger onerous or significant environmental compliance issues provided customary protocols for chemical handling are followed for purposes of manufacture import and export all of the key component chemicals of the gse proprietary reagent gsx® were found to be on the usepas toxic substance control act tsca inventory by name by an alternative name or by family additionally a third party study of scientific literature of the effects of exposure to the chemical components of gsx® for humans animals and the environment was conducted the study found the chemicals to be of low toxicity and the use of gsx® is not expected to produce untoward effects when proper diligence and care is taken in the handling transportation use and disposal of this product q is gse’s technology patented a gse has multiple patents granted and pending in the united states and numerous countries around the world for its technologies q what does green source energy® provide through its gsx® and liquex® licensing and consulting services programs a the gsx® and liquex® licensing and consulting services programs provide licenses and related consulting and
