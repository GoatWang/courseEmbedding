marketwatchs slice  the stoltz group increasingly modern organic synthesis is driven by the pursuit of function as evidenced in two of its central research endeavors total synthesis and methods discovery and development in complex natural product synthesis the ideal target is not only architecturally fascinating but also exhibits potentially useful medicinal properties toward which an efficient synthesis could provide useful quantities for further biological studies similarly in reaction discovery and development the new method ideally facilitates the efficient synthesis of motifs prevalent in medicinal or functional compounds and materials  our research group seeks to address difficult but rewarding fundamental problems in both synthesis and technology development such as the synthesis of quaternary stereocenters and selective ch functionalization ultimately we hope our endeavors will further the ideals of modern organic chemistry advancing the field from a basic science perspective while also lending to numerous applications in biomedicine and materials science  newscheck out our latest group news learn more researchlearn about our research focuses learn more teama
