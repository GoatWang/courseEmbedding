viewpoint in the design of blowhard what is blowhard why this farce  the impact of moneyfree computer assisted barter systems david l parnas introduction money versus barter as a mechanism for exchanging our current goods and services money versus barter for future sales what would barter mean for foreign trade are cabs a dream or are they current technology turning theory into practice what would be the net effect of the use of cabs can a materialistic “rational” system be humane cabs and the moral illnesses in the bishops report  software aspects of strategic defense systems david lorge parnas abstract introduction why software is unreliable why the sdi software system will be untrustworthy why conventional software development does not produce reliable programs the limits of software engineering methods artificial intelligence and the strategic defense initiative can automatic programming solve the sdi software problem can program verification make the sdi software reliable is sdio an efficient way to fund worthwhile research  sdi a violation of professional responsibility david lorge parnas introduction sdi background the role of computers my decision to act critical issues broader questions  the professional responsibilities of software engineers david lorge parnas abstract personal responsibility social responsibility and professional responsibility the social responsibility of scientists and engineers the professional responsibilities of engineers what are the obligations of the engineer professional practice in software development a simple example pacemakers other concerns the “know how” isnt there how to improve the level of professionalism in software development  software aging david lorge parnas abstract what nonsense the causes of software aging kidney failure the costs of software aging reducing the costs of software aging preventive medicine software geriatrics planning ahead barriers to progress conclusions for our profession  on icses “most influential papers” david lorge parnas background what are the best papers of our most important software engineering conference we must be doing somethings wrong we need to change something conclusions  teaching programming as engineering david lorge parnas introduction programming courses and engineering the important characteristics of programming courses the role of mathematics in engineering the role of programming in engineering business and science the content of most “standard” programming courses programming courses are not science courses a new approach to teaching programming the mathematics needed for professional programming teaching programming with this mathematical background experience conclusions  software engineering an unconsummated marriage

columbia david m weiss is the director of the software production research department at avaya laboratories his technical work has evolved into the invention of processes that incorporate ideas from families design for change measurement precise specification and technology transfer the result has been a software production process based on familyoriented abstraction specification and translation
