of nature books for young readers editorial reviews booklist near the end of march i borrowed an ax and went down tot he woods near walden pond    in brief easyreading passages chosen by schnur thoreau describes the construction of his famous cottage lists the possessions he filled it with and tallies sights an d sounds of the changing seasons concluding we can never have enough of nature fiores dappled impressionistic woodland scenes make the sentiment easy to comprehend though because his view is more often turned away from the actual house than toward it children will see less of the building than its setting libraries needing a followup to offer picturebook audiences intrigued by johnsons henry hikes to fitchburg or henry builds a cabin will be well served by this pleasing sundappled picture book for older children schnurs afterword provides context kirkus reviews these excerpts from thoreaus own journal piece together the events that formed the basis for walden borrowing an axe from a friend young thoreau enters the woods and begins to cut down trees to build his house working alongside the sounds sights and smells of nature he begins to form his philosophy for which he is famous living life simply as the seasons pass thoreau erects his house and begins to live in the woods fulltime he often sits quietly observing the birds as they flit from tree to tree with only the sounds of humanity to remind him of the passage of time whether it is picking ripe raspberries sitting in a boat on the nearby pond or entertaining other travelers in the woods thoreau is reminded w can never have enough of nature richly layered watercolor and oil painting depict the natural world in which thoreau lived from large landscape painting to that of a single flower or chestnut readers will enjoy the works visual appeal as they read through the original text written for younger children this might also assist older children or even adults as an introduction to one of the great philosophers in american history an editors note following the text gives more information about thoreaus life and work publishers weekly schnur the shadow children deftly plucks thoreaus own words from walden and fiores the boston tea party luminous watercolor and oil paintings affectingly evoke the simplicity and serenity of this mans existence on his beloved pond as thoreau chronicles a key chapter in his life—he repeatedly marvels at the sights and sounds of the natural world constantly changing with each season schnurs chosen passages reveal thoreau as a participant in rather than merely an observer of nature sometimes a rambler in the wood was attracted by the sound of my axe and we chatted pleasantly over the chips which i had made spare yet eloquent thoreaus words offer intriguing insight into his lifestyle as well as his philosophy describing the minimal contents of his house he notes my furniture part of which i made myself consisted of a bed a table a desk three chairs one for solitude two for friendship three for society fiores striking panoramas underscore the beauty and the appeal of the locale that became thoreaus home and inspiration while the interiors and spot art emphasize the simplicity of his lifestyle foreword one hundred fiftyseven years ago the author began his celebrated experiment in concord massachusetts i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived the editor has selected passages in which thoreau chronicles his labor of love he borrowed an axe in march of  and built his own cabin in the woods along walden pond each doublepage spread moves the reader ahead one month thoreau meticulously charts the progress of construction and lovingly details the glories of nature the illustrators fullpage lightfilled watercolor and oil paintings capture thoreaus simple yet eloquent text int he lower right corner of each text page fiore marks the passage of the seasons with lush thumbnail images of nature ducks upon an iceladen pond butterfly water lily apples pumpkin snowcovered berries readers may recognize fiores impressionistic style from his illustrations for the boston tea party holiday house and dear willie rudd simon and schuster editor schnur has also written picture books emphasizing nature like autumn an alphabet acrostic clarion and spring thaw viking as well as provocative middleyear novels emphasizing human nature and moral conflicts like the koufax dilemma william morrow and the shadow children william morrow schnur thinks that younger children ages five through eight will be able to identify with the philosophy of transcendentalist thoreau in the editors note he writes thoreau forever changed the way we think about nature and our place in it this beautiful book can easily prompt a discussion with children about the trappings of modern life what would daily life be like without computers cell phones and televisions what would it be like to build a cabin by yourself with only an axe and nails what would it be like to live in the woods what can humans learn from nature the answers elicited will surprise adults and open rich avenues for exploration the concord bookshop hard on the heels of author and illustrator db johnsons wonderful henry builds a cabin which features the ursine alter ego of concords own henry david thoreau comes henry davids housei a picture book with abridged text from thoreaus writings and information about his life and walden pond today the exquisite water color illustrations by peter fiore make this one to add to your library riverbank review henry davids house portrays another side of thoreau his deep almost reverent love of the natural world in this large lush book thoreau speaks for himself right from the start near the end of march i borrowed an axe and went down to the woods by walden pond and began to cut down some tall white pines for timber on the opposite page we see a young man in a waist coat and longish hair resolutely swinging an axe each spread includes a brief poetic paragraph or two from walden selected by schnur thoreau lyrically describes not just the building process i dug my cellar down to a fine sand where potatoes would not freeze in any winter but also the small telling details of his life in the woods i heard a stray goose cackling like the spirit of the fog peter fiores impressionistic watercolorandoil illustrations effectively evoke the new england landscape while giving us a sense of thoreau the man—drowsing in the summer sun driving a team of horses watching winters first snowflakes especially eyecatching is a birdseye view of thoreau boating in the autumn pond surrounded by water lilies still in this book it is the words that sing schnur has chosen carefully from walden leaving out the pedantic discourse and giving us instead thoreaus keen poetic descriptions of nature when he speaks of the moon traveling over the ribbed bottom of the pond the whooping of the ice or the red squirrel coursing over the roof we are there with him in this beloved solitude the cabin itself is not the important thing we realize by the end of the book thoreau is out here because as he says in the final quote we can never have enough of nature
