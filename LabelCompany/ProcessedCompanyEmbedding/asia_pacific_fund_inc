the use of derivatives may include other possibly greater risks including counterparty leverage and liquidity risks counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative as a result an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative which may make the funds returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price this risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions during which the fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions derivatives may also be harder to value less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the funds ability to use certain derivatives or their cost also derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits particularly during adverse market conditions emerging markets securities risk emerging markets also referred to as developing markets are generally subject to greater market volatility political social and economic instability uncertain trading markets and more governmental limitations on foreign investment than more developed markets in addition emerging markets may be subject to lower trading volume and greater price fluctuations than companies in more developed markets securities law and the enforcement of systems of taxation in many emerging market countries may change quickly and unpredictably in addition investments in emerging markets securities may also be subject to additional transaction costs delays in settlement procedures and lack of timely information foreign securities risk the funds foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability changes in economic or taxation policies difficulty in enforcing obligations decreased liquidity or increased volatility foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits in which the fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls unless the fund has hedged its foreign securities risk foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency or other instruments through which the fund has exposure to foreign currencies to decline in value currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time currency hedging strategies if used are not always successful geographic focus risk the fund may from time to time invest a substantial amount of its assets in securities of issuers located in a single country or a limited number of countries adverse economic political or social conditions in those countries may therefore have a significant negative impact on the funds investment performance growth investing risk growth stocks tend to be more expensive relative to the issuing companys earnings or assets compared with other types of stock as a result they tend to be more sensitive to changes in or investors expectations of the issuing companys earnings and can be more volatile management risk the fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the advisers judgment about markets interest rates or the attractiveness relative values liquidity or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the funds portfolio the fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect additionally legislative regulatory or tax developments may adversely affect management of the fund and therefore the ability of the fund to achieve its investment objective market risk the market values of the funds investments and therefore the value of the funds shares will go up and down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably market risk may affect a single issuer industry or section of the economy or it may affect the market as a whole individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments such as bonds during a general downturn in the financial markets multiple asset classes may decline in value when markets perform well there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the fund will rise in value preferred securities risk preferred securities are subject to issuerspecific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities preferred securities also may be subordinated to bonds or other debt instruments subjecting them to a greater risk of nonpayment may be less liquid than many other securities such as common stocks and generally offer no voting rights with respect to the issuer sector focus risk the fund may from time to time invest a significant amount of its assets ie over  in one market sector or group of related industries in this event the funds performance will depend to a greater extent on the overall condition of the sector or group of industries and there is increased risk that the fund will lose significant value if conditions adversely affect that sector or group of industries small and midcapitalization companies risks small and midcapitalization companies tend to be more vulnerable to changing market conditions may have little or no operating history or track record of success and may have more limited product lines and markets less experienced management and fewer financial resources than larger companies these companies securities may be more volatile and less liquid than those of more established companies and their returns may vary sometimes significantly from the overall securities market as of  asiax nav change    nas may appear until data is available data is usually updated between  and  pm cst fund details
