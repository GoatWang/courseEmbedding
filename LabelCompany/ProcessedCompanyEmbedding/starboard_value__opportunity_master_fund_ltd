wire ramius capital issues letter to a schulman stockholders urges stockholders not to be distracted by the company’s announcements attempting to create the illusion of change says new ceo gingo’s hastily fabricated “ day plan” is nothing more than a desperate last minute attempt to sway stockholder votes calls on stockholders to vote for ramius two independent nominees to ensure the company takes all actions to maximize stockholder value january    am eastern standard time new yorkbusiness wirestarboard value and opportunity master fund ltd an affiliate of rcg starboard advisors llc and ramius capital group llc collectively ramius today issued a letter to all stockholders of a schulman inc schulman or the company nasdaq shlm highlighting the company’s latest desperate effort to mislead stockholders ramius urges stockholders to ignore the company’s rhetoric and elect both michael caporale jr and lee meyer to the company’s board of directors at the upcoming  annual meeting of stockholders scheduled for january   the letter notes that mr gingo’s “ day plan” is nothing more than another restructuring plan that has no tangible or substantive metrics by which to hold management or the board accountable and questions whether the board is truly committed to exploring all strategic alternatives ramius partner mark mitchell stated “in our view mr gingo’s ‘ day plan’ has absolutely no substance and creates nothing more than the illusion of change clearly it is a desperate last minute attempt to sway stockholder votes just before the annual meeting the only tangible aspect of mr gingo’s ‘ day plan’ was a decision to suspend further capital investment in invision less than a week ago in its presentation to stockholders schulman advertised invision as an important part of the company’s future success and an area for investment the company is clearly still trying to find a direction” mr mitchell added “ramius independent nominees have successful and proven track records with significant ceo board and relevant industry experience stockholders deserve a board comprised of knowledgeable experienced and truly independent directors who are committed to exploring all available strategic alternatives and ensuring that the company is run for the best interest of all stockholders” ramius is the beneficial holder of approximately  of schulman’s outstanding shares the full text of the letter follows dear fellow stockholders recent actions by the a schulman board are a lastditch effort to sway your votes do not be distracted by the illusion of change as longterm stockholders of a schulman inc “schulman” or the “company we have seen schulman take actions time and time again to distract stockholders’ attention from the real strategic and operating issues facing the company these initiatives are designed to buy management and the board of directors even more time to continue to implement their flawed business strategy the company’s recent announcement of the new ceo’s generic socalled “ day plan” and of ramius’ unwillingness to settle the company’s third consecutive election contest just one week before the annual meeting is unmistakably a product of desperation designed to sway your vote past settlement agreements have not led to improved operating performance the time has come for this board to stop using settlement agreements as a tool to entrench itself and to continue its misguided business strategy consecutive settlement agreements have not led to improved operating performance glass lewis  co a leading independent proxy advisory firm recognizing the fallibility of past settlement agreements recently stated that it is “troubled by the lack of improvement in the company’s operational performance despite the presence of at least one barington nominee on the board since ” we will not sit by any longer while this board continues to fail to live up to its promises under settlement agreements as both stockholder value and operating performance continue to erode if these settlement agreements were really part of the solution at schulman ask yourself why would three of them in a row even be necessary we think the answer is clear the schulman board is only committed to settlement agreements to the extent that they buy this board more time for it to rubberstamp its failed strategies please do not be misled by schulman’s actions to create the illusion of change consider the following actions that we believe the company is using to influence your vote illusion  the company identified and hired a “highly qualified” candidate to replace terry haines as ceo the reality the board failed to bring in “new blood” to help turn around the company and instead handpicked a schulman insider with no apparent relevant industry experience and who has been a board member and therefore a part of the problem at schulman since  since mr gingo joined the board the company’s north american segment has been unprofitable in six of the past seven years and operating margins have declined by approximately  basis points despite numerous restructuring efforts this board did not run a comprehensive ceo search process illusion  mr gingo has hatched a socalled “ day plan” with a “real sense of urgency” to position the company for success the reality the “ day plan” is yet another restructuring plan that has no tangible or substantive metrics by which to hold management or the board accountable and is simply in our view another guise under which the company will continue its failed business strategies where has mr gingo’s “real sense of urgency” been while he has sat on a board that has watched over significant deterioration in the company’s operating performance for the past seven years in our view this “ day plan”  that provides for no accountability  is nothing more than a desperate last minute attempt to sway stockholder votes just before the annual meeting it seems to us that mr gingo only feels a real “sense of urgency” to say and do whatever it takes to get past this election contest the only tangible aspect of mr gingo’s “ day plan” was a decision to suspend further capital investment in invision less than a week ago in its presentation to stockholders schulman advertised invision as an important part of the company’s future success and an area for investment consider the fact that mr gingo has been the board’s technical advisor on this product since his appointment to the board in  why did it take so long for this board to suspend capital investment and assess the viability of this product illusion  the board is committed to exploring strategic alternatives and has a “whollyindependent” special committee already in place the reality the company adamantly opposed such a strategic alternatives review process in its initial response to our stockholder proposal on november   and “flipflopped” its position in our opinion to get past this election contest despite obvious conflicts as ceo mr gingo was selected to sit on the special committee and only in the face of pressure from ramius did the company recently announce that he would not participate as a “voting member” on the special committee illusion  the company is “responsive to stockholders’ interests” and has “implemented numerous corporate governance policy and practice improvements” the reality the only “improvements” that the company has implemented such as the redemption of its “poison pill” and the establishment of a “lead independent director” have been reactionary responses in the face of proxy contests in fact the company was required to implement each of these reforms under the terms of past settlement agreements you have the opportunity to protect your investment by voting for both of our highly qualified nominees michael caporale jr and lee meyer on the gold proxy card you empower our nominees to ensure that the company takes all actions to maximize stockholder value rest assured that they can and will appropriately represent the stockholders’ best interests we are asking for your support to elect directors who will represent your best interests on the schulman board please vote for mr caporale and for mr meyer on the gold proxy card we offer you the opportunity to elect to the schulman boardroom stockholder
