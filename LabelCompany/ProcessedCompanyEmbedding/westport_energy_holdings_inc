shares     carbonics taps dr paul miller for ceo   the board of directors of carbonics capital corporation otcbb cics has appointed paul t miller phd to the position of president and chief executive officer   prior to his acceptance of the position of president and ceo of carbonics dr miller was the founder and president of sustainable systems an oilseed processing facility specializing in the production of high oleic vegetable oils for food applications dr miller has a handson understanding of the challenges faced by early stage development projects and companies including diverse experience in finance sales marketing product development and operations dr miller earned a bs in chemistry from radford university and a phd in chemistry from the university of montana   “carbonics will focus on technological development and services that decarbonizes and increases efficiency within industry and commerce” said dr miller “our plan to build shareholder value involves the development and use of technologies that decrease carbon and energy intensity coupled with the monetization of those reductions to help drive our growth” carbonics’ first project involves its planned acquisition of the sustainable systems oilseed crush facility in culbertson montana from greenshift corporation otcbb gers and the restructuring and repositioning of this facility as a strategic location for the processing of carbonneutral second generation feedstocks for biofuel applications in addition carbonics intends to invest in the development of technology to manufacture carbonnegative third generation feedstocks for biofuel and specialty chemical applications   dr miller stated “i am energized by carbonics’ technology services business development and overall growth opportunities it remains extremely important that the private sector continue to develop and invest in renewable energy energy efficiency and clean technology that has diverse applications across industry and commerce we are collectively as a society facing unprecedented challenges in the form of resource scarcity and global climate change we believe that development of second and third generation feedstocks that help to streamline the flow of carbon through out and back into commerce presents a compelling opportunity to contribute meaningfully to the resolution of these challenges” the earth’s natural carbon cycle is out of balance we produce carbon dioxide in just about everything we do starting with breathing an average person will exhale about  tons of carbon dioxide over an average life span of  years the  billion people on our planet produce about  billion tons per year of carbon dioxide at zero industrial activity fossil fuel combustion and other industrial processes release about  billion tons per year of carbon dioxide containing  billion tons of carbon while this represents only about  of the estimated total amount of carbon resident in the atmosphere natural processes have not been able to balance out the increase this is evidenced by the fact that atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have risen  from preindustrial levels of about  parts per million to the current level of about  parts per million while each new part per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere corresponds to a total of  billion new tons of atmospheric carbon dioxide half of the carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere is absorbed into the earth’s oceans and forests this means that human activity has released about  trillion tons of carbon dioxide containing  billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere since the dawn of the industrial era the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in the early s was about  trillion tons the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today is about  trillion tons at current and expected rates of production we will release another  trillion tons of carbon dioxide containing  billion tons of carbon during the next  years and the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will be about  trillion tons this corresponds to an atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration of  parts per million which is double the preindustrial concentration the earth’s natural mechanisms for processing carbon dioxide are not keeping up with us we need to help if severe climate change is to be avoided new technologies will be needed to stem the tide reverse the flow and ultimately shut off the tap but we can take action immediately the first critical steps are simply to be smarter about how we consume fossil fuels and to use carbonneutral fuels as much as possible httpwwwgreenshiftcomwhowearephpmode sec filings carbonics capital corp
