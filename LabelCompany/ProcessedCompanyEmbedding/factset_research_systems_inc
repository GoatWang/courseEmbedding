capital iq contents  history  –  –  –  –  –present  products and services  products  services  clients  financial data  investor concerns  management  references  external links historyedit –edit factset was founded by howard wille and chunk snyder in  their partnership began in  when the two were working on wall street at faulkner dawkins  sullivan as computers became more prominent at the end of the s wille and snyder thought that the industry was changing when shearson purchased faulkner dawkins and sullivan and the company started to expand wille and snyder decided to set out on their own and test their idea for a company that could deliver computerbased financial information at the time companies had to purchase raw data directly from a vendor such as compustat then hire programmers to make the data userfriendly wille and snyder’s vision would offer usable data directly to the client originally all data was delivered to clients on paper often by bike messenger the first and namesake product was a program called company factset which produced a fourpage company analysis report using the value line database today factset users connect to factset’s private network via wan internet and wireless devices –edit in the early s factset employees numbered fewer than  in  snyder found a way to download data from the factset computer into visicalc meaning that clients could retrieve data from a database directly into a spreadsheet for the first time several steps in the process were eliminated making the data download process dramatically quicker in  factset added limited screening capabilities which were expanded in  with the introduction of universal screening which allowed users to stipulate their own screening criteria another development during the s was the  release of the companys private database service users could now store proprietary data and integrate it with their own information to perform custom analysis current chairman philip a hadley

their own and test their idea for a company that could deliver computerbased financial information at the time companies had to purchase raw data directly from a vendor such as compustat then hire programmers to make the data userfriendly wille and snyder’s vision would offer usable data directly to the client originally all data was delivered to clients on paper often by bike messenger the

written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by
