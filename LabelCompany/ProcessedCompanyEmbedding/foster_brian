at risk healthy chickens contribute to a safe and wholesome food supply we prioritize the health and welfare of our broilers through all stages of life our program emphasizes preventative flock health programs proper nutrition and advanced husbandry practices on our farms and in our plants hatcheries we select only the healthiest and robust chickens and turkeys for breeding at each of our carefully maintained breeding ranches each resulting egg is carefully checked cleaned and immediately taken to our nearest hatchery to keep them healthy the eggs are placed in incubators where they remain warm and undisturbed until they hatch our barns and farms after the chicks hatch they are taken to a local ranch where conditions promote natural growth each ranch has a “buffer zone” of empty land all around a biosecurity measure that helps to ensure bird health and promote food safety foster farms poultry flocks are never raised in cages our chickens and turkeys are grown in large poultry barns designed to protect the birds from environmental extremes while allowing fresh air to constantly circulate the interior temperature and climate are controlled and clean water and feed are available at all times our barns are built with enough space for the birds to move about freely the floors are covered with absorbent bedding materials such as rice hulls and wood shavings our veterinarians carefully monitor each flock’s health and progress our organic flocks are usda certified and raised freerange nutritious feed our chickens and turkeys mature naturally without added growth hormones or steroids they are fed a highly nutritious balanced diet composed primarily of corn and soy meal with vitamins and minerals added all of our feed ingredients are approved for use by the fda and usda

inspectors are onsite at our plants through all phases of operation and perform ongoing inspection of our products and facilities foster farms maintains a comprehensive food safety program and is committed to leading the poultry industry roots that run deep our history in  a young couple named max and verda foster started foster farms by borrowing  against a life insurance policy they invested in an acre farm near modesto california and began raising turkeys in the beginning max worked as an editor at the modesto bee a local newspaper to help support their young business while verda concentrated on raising healthy chicks the original hatchery was built right off their bedroom because the eggs required roundtheclock care verda would set a timer to alert her day and night when it was time to gently rotate the eggs a feed silo soon followed the back porch of the foster’s home became max’s office and business was mostly done with a handshake over the coming decades max and verda’s sons george paul and tom followed them into the business expanding it along the way building new facilities and adding new product lines but always remaining true to the spirit of their parents today foster farms remains a familyowned familymanaged company in  foster farms celebrated its th anniversary on the very farm where max and verda first began all those long years ago our farms in california since our founding in  by max and verda foster we have been dedicated to raising poultry that is truly fresh and truly local this commitment means more than great quality poultry it also means keeping jobs in california and contributing to our state’s economic growth family farms in the pacific northwest since  foster farms has worked with more than  familyowned farms in washington and oregon to produce locally raised chicken growing chicken this way allows us to support regional agriculture and local communities farms in louisiana in  foster farms acquired a poultry
