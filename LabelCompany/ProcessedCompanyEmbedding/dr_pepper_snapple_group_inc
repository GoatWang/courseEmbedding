cfo following our prepared remarks we will open the call for your questions with that ill turn the call over to larry larry d young  dr pepper snapple group inc thanks heather and good morning everyone ill start by saying that im proud of our teams for delivering strong topline results this quarter resulting from solid execution behind our focused consumercentric strategy in our csd portfolio once again we outperformed the category growing both dollar and volume share in irimeasured markets were investing behind our newest brand bai at greater levels than previously planned and are executing against the strategy we communicated back in april our results are encouraging and ill speak more about that in a moment our allied brand strategy continues to allow us to go where the consumer is going and drive both topline and bottomline growth for the business all of this while rci continues to improve the operating platform on which we run the business for the quarter bottler case sales increased  on just over  points of positive mix our csds grew  in a continued challenging environment and our noncarb brands increased by  in the quarter dr pepper increased  driven by regular dr pepper which grew  in the quarter and diet dr pepper which grew  again outperforming the diet category up grew  driven by growth in both the us and the caribbean this marks the third consecutive quarter of growth for this brand in the us following our rci lean track last year and our new marketing campaign for this year canada dry grew  and schweppes increased  on continued growth in the ginger ale and sparkling water categories aw was flat in the quarter peñafiel increased  on strong performance in both mineral water and our ades line  squirt grew by  and all other csds decreased  in noncarbs snapple bottler case sales declined by  in the quarter as strong shipments for a promotional event at a large retailer are expected to sell through in the third quarter motts increased  on growth in sauce and clamato grew  bai increased  primarily on the acquired volume outside our system as well as on continued growth in our own dsd system which grew by  in the quarter our expectation for the full year is still for volume growth on the brand across all systems of about  to  as we continue to gain new distribution and availability and drive trial activity in the marketplace our growth allied brands increased  driven by continued strong growth across bodyarmor core and fiji once again demonstrating the continued success and importance of this strategy all other ncbs declined  in the quarter our calendar for the back half of the year is packed with programs that will continue to unlock growth and leverage the power of our priority brands dr pepper will be front and center again this year during the college football season this program is right on strategy for the brand and continues to be more successful every year and were going to keep that momentum going and make it even bigger this year were bringing back our college football celebrity larry culpepper and his tailgating rv as well as executing national media across tv digital and social and driving strong activation at retail we will continue to communicate our new messaging on up across all platforms highlighting the versatility of the brand as i mentioned earlier the performance of this brand in the us has improved in recent quarters giving us earlyon confidence that were on the right track with consumers and weve got some exciting news on snapple for the first time well give consumers a new more convenient singleserve option as we roll out our ounce plastic bottle that looks and feels just like our iconic ounce glass bottle complete with a metal cap that pops now let me talk about the recent performance of bai the opportunities for the brand how were executing against our communicated strategy and driving sustainable growth for the longterm on a yeartodate basis retail sales of bai are up almost  across irimeasured channels significantly outperforming both the category and its key competitors were seeing strong growth across multiple channels and importantly in the grocery and convenience channel acv levels across base bai flavors and cocofusions have continued to improve across all channels however there is still a great deal of opportunity in the convenience channel with current acvs in the  range our current plans for the balance of the year for base and cocofusions in this channel should accelerate growth weve got new authorizations to add over  new stores across several large national and regional convenience store chains and thats just c stores weve also got authorizations for new skus in largeformat accounts that will go in during the fall reset timeframe and thousands of new cooler placements going in as well were placing several hundred additional bidrocap displays  across largeformat in the balance of the year and also just this month launched our second biosphere  market in southern california weve seen growth of about  over the past year in specific retail chains in the dallas biosphere  so were taking those learnings and expanding this innovative execution strategy into la and orange county and while bubbles is also showing positive acv gains this brand still has tremendous distribution potential across all channels as weve said were repositioning the brand from a price point package and shelfset perspective so as to capture share in sparkling water we expect to see improved performance on bubbles over the balance of this year and  we said in april that a critical piece of our strategy was not just about gaining new points of distribution but also about driving trial and getting the brand into consumers hands because we know that once they try it theyre likely to buy it again as demonstrated by the brands strong repeat purchase rate were currently running trialdriving activity in the marketplace at an even greater level than we originally planned as trial rates continue to show improvement and we want to maximize the opportunity through summer selling season we will also continue to run some level of activity through the balance of the year were also investing heavily in marketing to drive brand awareness as well as to drive trial spending  million in the second quarter as we had planned we recently received our first mroi analytics for bai and have seen strong response to our tv and social campaigns so we will continue those through the balance of this year were expecting our heaviest market investment in the third quarter of this year capitalizing on these learnings bais readytodrink tea is performing well in certain accounts where it has been repositioned in the tea set gaining several share points in a short period of time and our relaunch of antioxidant water is slated for the latter part of this year driving some upside this year but more so beginning in  the entire organization and i could not be more excited about the future of this brand now ill turn the call over to marty to walk you through the financials and our guidance martin m ellen  dr pepper snapple group inc thanks larry and good morning everyone overall second quarter results were in line with our expectations our base business results overachieved and we invested more heavily in bai reported net sales grew  on strong volume growth of  reported segment operating profit declined  in the quarter primarily on heavy marketing investments behind bai and higher marketing spend for our other priority brands marketing spend on bai was  million and we also increased marketing by  million on our other priority brands core operating income and core eps were both flat in the quarter now let me walk you through the details reported net sales increased  in the quarter including the bai acquisition which accounted for just over  percentage point of our net sales growth total bai sales including our dsd distribution accounted for just over  percentage points of our net sales growth and now bai represents about  of our total company revenues this represents a meaningful and important positive shift in our portfolio organic net sales grew as organic volumes were up over  product mix contributed just over  percentage points of growth net sales growth was partially offset by the loss of our remaining distribution of rockstar in the quarter reported gross margins decreased  basis points from  last year to  this year the unfavorable impact of unrealized marktomarket commodity changes decreased gross margins by  basis points excluding this core gross margins increased by  basis points the added margin from now owning the bai brand increased gross margins by  basis points while higher commodity costs and increases in certain manufacturing costs reduced gross margin by  basis points each further improving gross margins in the quarter were continued productivity benefits including those from rci and lower discounts these positive factors were partially offset by negative effects of foreign currency and unfavorable mix mostly from continued allied brand growth for the quarter sga increased  million the acquisition of bai added  million including  million in marketing and  million of transaction expenses sga also increased due to an unfavorable  million comparison of unrealized commodity marktomarket activity and further increased on a  million increase in planned marketing behind our other priority brands the remainder of the sga increase was mostly due to certain operating expenses and additional planned investment behind our dsd frontline workforce depreciation and amortization increased  million in the quarter other income increased  million which includes a  million gain from the termination of our distribution of rockstar reported income from operations declined by  million in the quarter however  million of this decline was due to an unfavorable comparison of unrealized marktomarket activity the impact of the bai acquisition including  million of acquisition and transaction expenses contributed  million of this decline below the operating line net interest expense increased  million mostly due to the higher debt balances associated with the bai acquisition we recognized a  million loss in the quarter on the early extinguishment of debt other income declined by  million as last year included a  million gain on the settlement of a multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liability our reported effective tax rate was  compared to  in the prioryear period this quarters tax rate included a  million favorable tax planning benefit moving on to cash flow cash from operating activities was  million down  million compared to last year primarily driven by timing of payables capital spending was  million compared to  million last year total distributions to our shareholders were  million with  million in dividends paid and  million in shares repurchased before i move on to guidance id like to give a quick update on rci weve shared in the past about how we utilize the tools of lean not only to drive productivity across the business but also to help drive topline growth whether it be closing voids across several of our priority brands improving display execution or as larry just mentioned the impressive improvement weve seen in our us up business over the past couple of quarters our  lean tracks are well underway and ill mention just a couple of wins that further demonstrate the application of lean process improvements to drive sales as a result of our dsd display execution track our texoma region reached their highest display acv in five years representing a  improvement over the prior year by implementing single point selling training and developing account manager standard work and a northern california region of a large retailer achieved a  display rate improvement across our warehouse direct business theres a tremendous amount of rci activity that happens across the business on a daily basis so much so that were going to increase our investment in rci by actively seeking additional rci resources to add to our strong bench of highlytrained lean and six sigma professionals im proud of where were at as a company only six years into our endless rci journey now moving to  guidance were now expecting net sales growth of about  as the recent weakening of the dollar is causing foreign currency translation to no longer have a material impact on net sales we continue to expect that about  of this net sales will come from our acquisition of bai organic volume growth is still expected to be over  and the acquisition of bai is still expected to contribute just under  of our total company volume growth there is just over  pricemix embedded within our growth and about  basis points of this pricemix is the impact of our beginning of the year concentrate price increase our expected revenue growth also reflects the recent loss of our distribution of the rockstar brand on the west coast moving on to cost of goods given our hedged positions and current market prices for our unhedged positions we continue to expect packaging and ingredients excluding the acquired bai business to be inflationary by about  basis points on a constant volume mix basis for your modeling purposes remember that growth of our noncarb portfolio including our allied brands will increase the dollar value of cost of goods and also remember that cost of goods sold is negatively impacted by foreign currency transaction collectively all the factors i mentioned above coupled with the added gross margin we realize now being the brand owner of bai are expected to result in a full year gross margin increase of about  basis points moving to sga excluding our acquisition of bai were still expecting an increase of approximately  million collectively in general cost increases and expense associated with investments made in our dsd frontline workforce we also continue to expect an increase of approximately  million to  million in health and welfare and risk insurance expenses rci productivity benefits will help offset a portion of these increases we expect marketing investment excluding bai to be about  of net sales in line with historical trends now moving below segment operating profit our net interest expense is still expected to include an incremental  million  associated with the debt to acquire bai in other income we will be lapping a  million favorable noncash gain on our acquisition of our aguafiel joint venture in mexico in the third quarter of last year other income for this year includes the  million gain on our equity in bai that was recorded in the first quarter and the  million gain on the termination of the rockstar agreement that was recorded this quarter our fullyear core tax rate is still expected to be approximately  we continue to expect strong free cash flow in  with stock repurchases of approximately  million to  million subject to market conditions we also continue to expect capital spending to be approximately  of net sales we continue to expect foreign currency to negatively impact our income from operations in  the combined effect of both foreign currency translation and transaction is now expected to reduce core eps by approximately  for the year primarily driven by our assumption on the mexican peso which we have forecasted at  to the dollar for the balance of the year the impact of bai on consolidated core eps is now expected to be  dilutive as we have further increased trialdriving activity in the marketplace taking all of the above into account we are still expecting core eps in the  to  range now let me provide some commentary to help you with your modeling for the third quarter as certain yearoveryear expense increases and lapping the gain i just mentioned should be considered first with respect to the acquired bai business the brand is still expected to ramp up over the balance of the year and importantly we are expecting our heaviest level of marketing investment behind the brand in the third quarter as a reminder we spent  million in marketing this quarter and second we expect about  million of the health and welfare and risk insurance increase to occur in the third quarter with that said let me turn the call back over to larry larry d young  dr pepper snapple group inc thanks marty before we open the lines for questions let me leave you with a few brief thoughts were focused on driving growth through our priority brand strategy and our business is strong were executing against our communicated strategy for bai gaining new points of distribution on availability driving trial and investing significantly behind the brand to drive awareness our early results are encouraging and we are excited about the future of this brand our allied brand strategy is working and continues to drive meaningful growth for the company rci continues to drive both topline growth and productivity across the business and most importantly we remain committed to returning excess free cash to our shareholders over time operator were ready for our first question questionandanswer session operator your first question comes from the line of vivien azer of cowen and company vivien azer  cowen and company llc hi good morning larry d young  dr pepper snapple group inc morning vivien martin m ellen  dr pepper snapple group inc good morning vivien azer  cowen and company llc so my one question has to do with bai please youve clearly made a lot of headway in terms of locking in new distribution from a retail perspective so can you just remind us for the  to  growth outlook how is kind of the underlying growth evolved in terms of the mix of velocity versus distribution gains thank you martin m ellen  dr pepper snapple group inc vivien its marty so its a combination of the two i know we shared on the slide this morning where we are in terms of acv and also where velocities have improved too through the year so really were counting on both the velocities is really of course a hugely encouraging number because that will entitle us to more space over time and of course that is a huge factor the other consideration for the brand balance of year is both the improvement emphasis on bubbles which were really just getting started because we repositioned it and then some of the other innovation both water and tea and well get some of that in the back half and depending upon retailer calendars some of that may push to  but weve considered all that in our guidance operator your next question comes from the line of mark swartzberg of stifel mark david swartzberg  stifel nicolaus  co inc oh good morning gentlemen lot of discussion about bai of course but i wonder if we could take a broader view either a total carbonated view or a total portfolio view and what im getting at is it seems like you guys are bobbingandweaving better than some of your competition as walmart price promotes and amazon does what theyre doing and so im not asking for a retailerspecific set of trends but can you give us a sense again whether its for the total csds or for the total portfolio how your channel performance is laying out for your portfolio what the comparative strength is from channeltochannel larry d young  dr pepper snapple group inc yeah mark i think the biggest thing is as you keep looking at how we go to market with our consumercentric strategy i mean our customers really like the data that we bring in where we have the brands at the right place the right price points the right occasions so its working very well for us across all of our channels and the teams go in our sales stories are all in – its factbased its all data its points they want to see that help them drive more people through their store so it goes across all of our lrbs i mean weve got the priority brands we go in thats the main thing we sell priority brands and bai bai is a priority brand now and our results are showing that it works martin m ellen  dr pepper snapple group inc mark let me add something because ill probably headoff another question from somebody else it goes to execution and we dont underestimate execution and any of you that have been around us and talked about rci quality and delivery from the customers perspective comes before productivity we invested in our workforce this industry has forever had too much turnover and too many open positions and it leads to poor service every order in this company gets filled complete and on time shelves get merchandised properly so there are no out of stocks not that there arent any but we measure this stuff we go after this stuff and this quarter was as much about investing in marketing and our brands as investing in the people that are out there executing and while i cant point to it we would hope and expect and believe that some of that effort and work is resulting in our topline performance mark david swartzberg  stifel nicolaus  co inc thats great and if i could follow up on that topic when you look at the absolute growth of say c stores versus say club stores or large format can you just give us some sense of the complexion of growth whats performing best whats slower larry d young  dr pepper snapple group inc yes i think as you look at it as far as growth mark you said not mention any account specific but walmarts doing very well run well with walmart convenience is always a strong strong focus of ours we continue to go after the convenience channel aggressively we noticed it was a little lighter in the second quarter the entire channel but we still did well there so i think thats kind of where were driving most of it mark david swartzberg  stifel nicolaus  co inc fair enough great thank you gentlemen operator your next question comes from the line of laurent grandet of credit suisse laurent grandet  credit suisse securities usa llc good morning larry and marty larry d young  dr pepper snapple group inc good morning martin m ellen  dr pepper snapple group inc morning laurent grandet  credit suisse securities usa llc yeah i just want to have i mean if you can add some color to all the niche marketing initiatives you are doing on bai in term of driving the trial and also i mean moving bottles into a different place in the store so thats one and two if you dont mind in term of numbers you said you would spend about  million this year in additional marketing  million on core  million on bai right now youve spent  million on core  million on bai additional so are you still planning to maintain  million for bai for the balance of the year or rebalance between core and bai or just spend less martin m ellen  dr pepper snapple group inc laurent its marty let me take the marketing question here so probably a little less on marketing but more in trade and that should be somewhat expected if you think about what were trying to do shortterm to drive trial if youve been in your large format stores youve probably seen the three for  promotion if youve been in your c stores youve probably see two for  or price point thereabout which is what we decided as larry said to just go after and particularly take advantage of the summer and spend our money mostly our money right to do that so we could do it quickly and get the results weve gotten so it partly makes sense too to spend a little more and get the trial going particularly as we continue to build it through acv because we want to have really strong acv numbers as we do more national whole marketing on the marketing side as larry said weve got our first set of learnings from the analytics that we do to understand return and contributions from marketing larry touched on a few things that were going to emphasize their heavy media calendar is picking back up as i said so more than a  million number in the third quarter as i said so we think right now we have a really good balance of both what were doing in marketing and the vehicles that were spending that money on in terms of effectiveness and then spending the trade dollars which of course the trade dollars come out of net sales thats the way theyre treated on our books okay so that puts a little pressure on that but thats just trialdriving activity thatll go away at some point here we do have activity through the balance of the year and then well hope youll see the brand at some different everyday price point laurent grandet  credit suisse securities usa llc thank you and in term of marketing spend i mean you said you would spend more in q should we think about kind of a   between q and q martin m ellen  dr pepper snapple group inc the way i would think about modeling us is take my comments youre going to have to think about that fullyear number from bai third quarter being more than  million and i said for the company without bai i said we should average something around   consistent with historical trends laurent grandet  credit suisse securities usa llc okay well thank you very much i appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of robert ottenstein of evercore robert ottenstein  evercore isi great thank you very much was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the allied brand pipeline i think a year or so ago you mentioned that you were doing a couple of trials of potential new allied brands and i dont think we ever heard about that so id love to get your thoughts on that and then second what youre seeing in terms of the hispanic consumer and there are some reports – target talked about some weakness in that demographic and wondered if you were seeing that also thank you larry d young  dr pepper snapple group inc yes yes ill start off with the hispanic with our brands that are so strong with the hispanic community you saw the growth we had in peñafiel the growth we had in clamato our flavored csds are all growing so i think were still doing very well there with the consumer there the first part of the question martin m ellen  dr pepper snapple group inc ill take it allied brand pipeline so theres a lot happening there weve probably robert looked at i dont know listed  maybe  opportunities in all sorts of – some of the spaces a lot happening in the readytodrink coffee space were there with high brew there are a lot of things happening a lot of subcategories or subsegments within these larger segments are emerging on the basis of organic or natural so youll see theres an interesting view of maybe around the energy category in organic energy products or natural energy products and so the question continues to be picking the right horses for us to ride and as ive told many of you before its about making sure that our checklist gets fulfilled in terms of the management the strategy were aligned on the opportunity because were not going to own these companies and were not going to be able to control a lot of decisions their access to capital so we dont have to fund them so that they can have the resources to act as the brand owner which has a lot to do with not just in product but selling and marketing and we continue to look at them we believe we continue to have capacity through our system to handle them so were not constrained on our side but if were going to put the effort in we have to pick something that we think is going to work and work over the longterm some products come and go and we just cant waste our time with those operator your next question comes from the line of bonnie herzog of wells fargo bonnie l herzog  wells fargo securities llc hi good morning martin m ellen  dr pepper snapple group inc good morning bonnie bonnie l herzog  wells fargo securities llc i just wanted to dig a little bit deeper on the nonmarketing expense increase in the quarter perhaps you could walk us through how much of that was onetime in nature versus how much of it is trending upwards and expected to continue and then finally what if anything are you guys doing to bring those expenses back down martin m ellen  dr pepper snapple group inc okay bonnie i think i can do this simply for you if you look at youre a schedules and core sga youll see in the quarter its up  million the breakdown is really three numbers we said  million we brought over from bai that didnt exist last year so thats the sga which includes their  million of marketing thats  million  million i said is our increase in marketing and most of the balance threequarters of the balance is increased investment in labor and our frontline workforce other than that theres a few million dollars left over which is i believe less than a  increase so actually were pretty happy with our sga performance so you just have to consider those pieces were really not comparable yearoveryear because we acquired bai thats the biggest piece and then of course our increase in marketing the frontline labor investment we actually started making last year in the second half so a lot of the increase in that should go away back half of the year operator your next question comes from the line of steve powers of ubs stephen r powers  ubs securities llc great hey good morning so just back to bai the results look good but obviously there were a number of questions raised last quarter and youre pushing through a lot of change and the departure intraquarter of ben weiss seemed a bit of a surprise at least from the outside so can you just talk about how youre managing that transition to maintain momentum i know you put lain hancock in charge and i think lains great so lain if youre listening congrats but i think lain has spent most of his time in hr and supply chain roles and this seems a very different assignment so maybe just some sort of your perspective there because its been a question that ive received a couple times since the announcement thanks larry d young  dr pepper snapple group inc youre correct it is a very different assignment but thats how we create general managers that can run every bit of the business and we spend a lot of time here on how we develop leaders for the future and we put them in a lot of different roles and so i think i can tell you hes doing a great job but i think the people there will tell you that hes doing a great job weve still got ken and most of the team there in place the momentum is just continuing to build as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we couldnt be more excited about what were seeing for the future ben was a wonderful entrepreneur who created a tremendous brand and i think we all knew it would be tough for him being in a public company i mean weve all seen it in the past so we thank him for his contributions and were just thrilled to death with the way the team is under lain and ken operator your next question comes from the line of judy hong of goldman sachs judy e hong  goldman sachs  co thank you good morning everyone so marty i guess i wanted to just clarify the fullyear guidance i think a few items have kind of changed youve got more favorable fx versus prior guidance youve got a little bit more dilution on bai youve got higher sales growth forecast now it kind of seems like your guidance if i kind of take all the puts and takes could actually be a  or  higher than prior guidance so im just wondering if im missing anything in terms of some of adverse headwinds that you didnt specifically call out thats either the same or gotten worse versus prior guidance martin m ellen  dr pepper snapple group inc well i think judy you have it right were spending a little more on bai as we discussed a minute ago some lifts to improvement lower effective fx were midway through the year the guidance range is a  range and at this point we didnt see any need to want to change our expectation well see where were at next quarter operator your next question comes from the line of amit sharma of bmo drew n levine  bmo capital markets united states hi there this is drew levine on for amit thanks for taking the question just wanted to touch on the latin america segment certainly a better margin performance than we were expecting and also some strong sales performance so just wondering if you could comment on whats driving that and which countries specifically youre seeing some strength in thanks martin m ellen  dr pepper snapple group inc lab for us is predominantly mexico and as we said in our prepared remarks peñafiel at just up  that is their lead brand we look at that business down there we look at the market down there and quite frankly our team down there just continues to do two things really well innovate and execute and its just that simple they continue to outperform and peñafiel this quarter as i said up  and theyve done some flavor innovation theyve introduced a coconut flavor that i think has now become if not three number four peñafiel flavor and the consumer environment may have gotten a little better down there but our growth our performance is clearly market share gaining in mexico and i wish i could point to something specific or some something we discovered some secret recipe well if i did i probably wouldnt tell you but its not they are just doing the basics of the business every single day better than they did it the day before it and wed be remiss if we didnt congratulate our team at this point for their performance operator your next question comes from ali dibadj of bernstein ali dibadj  sanford c bernstein  co llc hey guys so two questions on bai one is just back to the level of reinvestment want to get a sense of how youre actually thinking about the roi on it clearly youre spending more on it than i think you probably had anticipated when youre modeling the acquisition dilution its gone to  from  how do you think about the roi i know its a very short timeframe youre saying look the velocity is good etcetera but on an ongoing basis what do you think the level of spend should be and how do you measure it and then the second question i had on bai was really when you first took it on you were very very adamant about its going to be run separately its going to keep its entrepreneurial flavor et cetera et cetera and clearly that was to i think mitigate the problems you did see with ben being in a public company you said yourself and of course he leaves as a wealthy man from this entrepreneurial venture but how does that i guess change of plan or messiness for lack of a better word impact do you think your attractiveness to other potential entrepreneurs to join dps as the nicer better to work with company right has that halo disappeared a little bit so roi and then just the attractiveness going forward given some of the changes thanks larry d young  dr pepper snapple group inc yeah ill let marty handle the roi but as far as bai in the beginning we said bai would be bai and it is its being run separately when youre publicly traded there are certain things that have to be in place and so weve got those in place were still running out of trenton new jersey well continue to do that they know now that they can come to us whenever they need things different resources and ive got a tremendous relationship with a bunch of these entrepreneurs that love us to death but they also know that whenever it comes into something like if it doesnt work because a lot of our entrepreneurs have already done it once before with fuze and with vitaminwater and different ones so its just a learning curve but they also know that the relationship with us is that weve got this tremendous distribution arm that we can go out there and get them in places where they cant go anywhere else and have that kind of coverage so it works both ways its a partnership its a team effort and were not looking at any others were picking up right now but we never quit looking so i think we got good relationships with all of them martin m ellen  dr pepper snapple group inc ali your question on roi is actually a very good one because bai is a different brand than actually all of our other brands normally when we would plan trade and im going to address this from a trade roi perspective as opposed to a marketing roi perspective when we normally think about planning trade with more mature brand were connecting the dots between an investment our elasticity models in terms of the lift from say a price reduction and connecting the dots to the extent that we have to do some of that either to get the lift to create the velocity if needed for the retailer but in essence its a simple price sort of volume tradeoff thats been modeled we think quite sophisticatedly now in the case of bai remember of course we expect lift from trade and promo pricing but the real return needs to come from improvement in trial which will also show up as improvement in household penetration we know where the household penetration is we would go to raise the household penetration weve probably seen a couple points of improvement so far in trial as measured but we cant get this data realtime we need to use our services to go out and survey the consumers do their panel work and come back to us with the data which may or may not be available to all of you im not sure so but ultimately thats what were going to be looking for here very soon and that will be our ultimate measure of success in driving trial as opposed to the way we look at trade on our traditional brands operator your next question comes from the line of peter grom of jpmorgan peter k grom  jpmorgan securities llc thank you and good morning martin m ellen  dr pepper snapple group inc morning peter k grom  jpmorgan securities llc i just wanted to ask a quick question on snapple you mentioned in the press release that strong shipments from a promotional event are expected to sell through in the third quarter so one have you already started to see this sellthrough occur and i just want to get your thoughts on how we should think about the growth for the brand in the back half of the year thanks larry d young  dr pepper snapple group inc yes were already seeing the results for july  and so were pleased with it theres still a lot more to go i think weve got our plans with the plastic bottle weve got a lot of different things out there that were going to be using with snapple the juice side of our snapples still doing very well juice continues to grow so as we get going into the selling season for resets i mean were going in with a very strong tea strategy with snapples our flavored teas our straightup teas and our bai superteas so i think the trades really embracing seeing that we can come in and cover all angles of the tea category operator your next question comes from the line of lauren lieberman of barclays lauren rae lieberman  barclays capital inc thanks good morning martin m ellen  dr pepper snapple group inc good morning lauren rae lieberman  barclays capital inc the revenue this quarter i mean was incredibly strong and remarkably we havent talked about that yet so i think on up were all well aware of the more specific actions youve taken in the last couple of months the renewed advertising repositioning and so on but anything else that you think youd want to call out where something has changed where youve done something a bit differently thats really kind of kicked in and then as we look at the back half of the year i know you have a legacy of being conservative but it feels like the net sales change was more about fx than about the better than expected organic this quarter so is there anything we should keep in mind sequencingwise any kind of timing shift in the second half that hasnt been mentioned yet thank you martin m ellen  dr pepper snapple group inc lauren its marty ill take it and larry can add if he so chooses theres a lot of things wed like to think that all the effort and money we put into developing our strategy a couple years ago really going deep with the consumer and using that data to align our marketing campaign up being a great example the focus that came from that by us making choices choices about what brands to focus on as priority and what brands not to and where to direct our resources and then we overlay execution and our focus on execution our focus on the customer our portfolio we like our portfolio weve always said we think we have an advantaged portfolio and particularly in csds larry talked about the opportunity we see in tea and lets not leave out water when you look across our allied brands in bai and what weve got happening there and the selling stories were going to have from retailers there so we put all that together and say yeah i said we overachieved we did not predict that level of topline but were really satisfied and encouraged and we think that its a collection of those activities there is business to be had there is share to be gained in csds i dont know if its a zero sum game or not but that doesnt mean we cant gain share and work hard at it and were going to continue to do that operator your next question comes from the line of kevin grundy of jefferies kevin grundy  jefferies llc thanks good morning everyone martin m ellen  dr pepper snapple group inc morning kevin larry d young  dr pepper snapple group inc morning kevin grundy  jefferies llc two questions ill ask them both concurrently so the first one just to sort of clean up the bai question marty so is it too early to say that the cost of growth will be higher for that brand this was sort of asked earlier but so is the nickel more dilutive but the growth outlook doesnt change maybe there was some conservatism in that maybe not but how should we think about that dynamic where its more dilutive youre spending more behind it but seemingly the growth outlook hasnt changed but maybe thats not the case maybe the expectation is this is longterm brandbuilding and as you guys are thinking about it this is more of a  acceleration than  so just to sort of tie the loop on that and some quantification would be great and then marty you just touched on csds so youve done really nicely from a share perspective as has coke and pepsi continues to donate share what are you seeing differently from them im not sure how much you want to comment on your competition i sort of understand that are you seeing anything differently from an execution perspective are you seeing a share of voice move down and theyve started talk a little bit more about spending behind north america beverages so if thats the case and indeed that does play out do you have enough cushion in your guidance here to match from a spending perspective thank you for both of those martin m ellen  dr pepper snapple group inc all right kevin appreciate your question let me talk about bai bai in terms of donating share last time i looked nobodys a charity nobodys donating anything we all go out every day and we work hard and they work hard too look bai investment its a great question so the cost of growth end of the year we talked about upwards of  million in marketing traditional sort of pull marketing and weve come down a little bit and replaced some of that with trade to drive shortterm trial activity clearly from a marketing point of view the marketing for that brand probably for a while will stay elevated its a relative question relative to what well relative to  of sales of cores because our brands are mature our brands have high household penetration they have enormous brand awareness and brand equity we would nowhere need to do the same tactics of course on our mature brands that we would on an evolving and more nascent brand and were not going to let this opportunity get away from us we are not going to be shortsighted here we have an opportunity to do something we havent had the opportunity to do it before this brand has lots of opportunity and were going to go after it but were going to go after it with discipline were going to put money into what our data says works and pull money away from things that dont work im not here saying therefore that were going to open up the spigots and spend all sorts of money into  but clearly at some level much higher than historically you would find us doing the trade which is not insignificant this year thats shortterm thats going to drive trial well get a lot of information from that you will see the brand move back to some higher everyday price points so therefore we wont be funding that margin to the retailer any more and then the innovation and i think were just getting started i know we probably communicated earlier in the year that some of that would hit later this year and we have gone back and worked on bubbles larry touched on both the tea and the water probably reallyd be more  growth platforms than  were really excited about the opportunity to present our portfolio to retailers who are clearly looking to find more margin and weve got higher price point valueadded brands for them that we think are going to create a really compelling story so nearterm bai yeah the cost of growth may come somewhat higher but again of course wed expect that did we model it all initially no but weve had a lot of good learnings and i dont think the amounts were going to spend are going to be that material more so than we thought either i lost the csd question somewhere larry d young  dr pepper snapple group inc well with csd what were seeing out there i think marty touched on our competitors are very very competitive they run a great operation i think were very fortunate that weve got some of the right brands some of the flavors that the consumers looking for we mentioned that we invest in our brands we invest in our people and thats whats delivering our results operator your next question comes from the line of bryan spillane of bank of america bryan d spillane  bank of america merrill lynch hey good morning and thanks for taking the question i just had one related to bai manufacturing marty i think my understanding is that most of bai is still copacked or produced by a third party so i guess if you can clarify if thats true and if so over time is there an opportunity to capture more of the profits of the manufacturing profit by bringing more of that production inhouse over time martin m ellen  dr pepper snapple group inc the answer bryan is yes it is copacked yes theres an opportunity we do have a contractual relationship with a copacker whom were working with very closely that contract will have upwards of five years to go there are opportunities not just to bring the production inhouse but also the logistics of moving production to other places geographically all the bai product now really gets shipped from the east coast so just simple supply chain and logistics would say over time we need to change the geographic footprint of the bai supply chain and we will be doing that there will be profit upside not actually insignificant operator your final question this morning comes from pablo zuanic of sig pablo zuanic  susquehanna financial group lllp good morning everyone look i have two questions so first thinking about your capacity to do further deals in terms of the allied brands and it seems to me that if any of the three allied brands came up for sale in the near term based on my estimates of valuation you will not be able to bid given what your balance sheet is if you could comment on that and the second one would be going back to bai maybe its a marketing  question but it seems to me like youre stretching the brand too much and that the core business could suffer as a result so thinking of ways to turn  tea into water into sparkling water i cant imagine how vita coco or like gold peak or brands of that nature would be extendable as much so if you can explain why bai is extendable compared to other brands thanks martin m ellen  dr pepper snapple group inc okay ill take a stab at both of those so bai the extendability of bai i think as we look at the brand halo from consumers it sort of positions it not so much as just an enhanced water but as this cleanlabel betterforyou pure beverage so weve done some research on this its got to be done in a certain way though if your question really goes to for example the reason youre seeing maybe tea not as penetrated as maybe we would have thought six months ago its because we want to make sure that if its in the tea set all of the things were doing to increase brand awareness and equity through marketing will allow the brand to stand on its own there as opposed to the tea for example being simply viewed by the consumer as a flavor extension of the enhanced water because the consumer data would say that the demand space and the needs being satisfied in the enhanced water category if you will are going to be different both in tea and within plain tea and flavored tea there are even differences there so there is sort of a method to our approach to this to make sure that the strength of the base and the strength of the marketing around the base can be haloed look with respect to our capacity to make acquisitions and what may or may not happen to these other allied brands weve said this and ill say it again theres risk in our strategy of opening up our distribution to go where the consumer is going quickly because we dont ultimately control what happens with these brands and who may own these brands we have under the right circumstances we would look to possibly acquire something but thats not our strategy were prepared look were prepared to if necessary we may have to give one or more of these up over time the pipeline is full you just go to any beverage industry tradeshow and you will see football field rooms full of innovative ideas and people looking for distribution we cant predict what the future would hold it is a risk and no we would not step up and acquire all these brands i can probably say that with certainty larry d young  dr pepper snapple group inc all right well thanks for joining in the call today and for your continued interest and investment in dr pepper snapple group operator

mobile view dr pepper snapple group inc essay example for free dr pepper snapple group inc essay custom student mr teacher eng   june  dr pepper snapple group inc dr pepper snapple group inc is a major integrated brand owner bottler and distributer of nonalcoholic beverages in the united states in  they had net sales of  billion  manufacturing facilities and approximately  distribution centers in the united states they are the number one company in carbonated soft drink products in the united states their business strategy is to invest most heavily in their key brands to drive profitable and sustainable growth by strengthening consumer awareness developing innovative products and brand extensions to take advantage of evolving consumer trends improving distribution and increasing promotional effectiveness dr pepper snapple group inc also wants to focus on driving growth in their business with emerging categories through brand extensions new product launches and selective acquisitions of brands and distribution rights the company has a future goal of significantly increasing the number of branded coolers and other cold drink equipment over the next few years which is expected to provide an attractive return on investment the company also intends to leverage its integrated business model to reduce costs by strategically creating greater geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage and to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of large retail customers by coordinating sales service distribution promotions and product launches a question came into play of whether or not a profitable market opportunity existed for a new energy beverage brand to be produced marketed and distributed by the company in  with the company’s current strengths business strategy and positive reputation it would seem to be a good move but one must first consider the competition customer and if the company itself can successfully introduce a new product to a specific market the company has several succinct strengths they have a strong portfolio of leading consumer preferred brands this means that they have a diverse portfolio of bottlers distributors and retailers with a wide variety of products and provide a foundation for growth and profitability their snapple brand is also a leading ready to drink tea overall in  more than  percent of dr pepper snapple group inc volume was generated by brands that hold either the first or second position in their category the strength of these key supporting brands has served as a platform for lunching innovations and brand extensions in the past such as accelerade rtd a ready to drink sports drink that launched in late may  the company therefore had experience in what it truly meant to create a new branded energy drink which would serve to be useful as the strategy would be similar entering a new product market a second strength the company possesses is their integrated business model this provides opportunities for net sales and profit growth through the alignment of the economic interest of its brand ownership and its bottling and distribution business thirdly they have strong and long standing customer relationships this is so important for the success of a company they have a wide range of strong relationships from bottlers and distributors to national retailers large food service and convenience store customers they also have strong relationships with some of the most important us retailers including walmart safeway kroger and target another strength is their attractive positioning within a large growing and profitable market they hold the number three position in the united states canada and mexico beverage market the company has a great competitive edge as they cater to the need for convince and the demand for product with health and wellness benefits more so than any of their competitors dr pepper snapple group inc also has a broad geographic manufacturing and distribution coverage they have  manufacturing facilities and approximately  distribution centers in the united states the company has strategically laced their warehouse at or near bottling pants and geographically dispersed them across sales regions to ensure company products are available to meet consumer demand this enables them to better align their operations with customers reduce transportation costs and have greater control over the timing and coordination of new product launches another strength is their strong operating margins and significant stable cash flows the breadth and strength of the dr pepper snapple group inc product portfolio has enabled the company to generate strong operating margins which combined with relatively modest capital expenditures have delivered significant and stable cash flows this in turn creates stockholder value by enabling the company to consider a variety of alternatives such as investing in its business reducing debt and returning capital to its stockholders lastly they have an experienced executive management team they all have an average of more than  years of experience in the food and beverage industry the team has a broad experience in brand ownership bottling distribution and enjoys strong relations both within the industry and with major customers they also have diverse skills that support operating strategies including driving organic growth through target and efficient marketing reducing operating costs enhancing distribution efficiencies aligning manufacturing bottling distribution interests and executing strategic acquisitions dr pepper snapple group inc realized they had a weakness as they were the only major nonalcoholic beverage company with no energy drink brand of their own they also recognized an opportunity no company had yet positioned themselves as an adult energy drink going into the energy beverage market also seemed to correlate with what their future and current goals were industry analysts were projecting an average annual growth rate of  percent from  to  also since their current demographic was more health conscious then the competition which gives them a competitive competency they also had another untapped opportunity to market their energy drink by differentiation currently there are five major competitors that dominate the us energy beverage market red bull north america hansen natural corporation pepsicola rockstar inc and cocacola pepsi and cocacola also compete with what dr pepper already offers from an industry and market point of view sadly when it comes to advertising funds available dr pepper has some funds available but not nearly close to what red bull has with that being the case we feel that an avoidance of the competition by going the route of a product innovation technique by means of differentiation would be the best route for dr pepper snapple group inc to be successful there are some warning signs in the industry the energy beverage market has experienced product proliferation and price erosion in recent years proliferation resulted from line extensions new packaging and size and market segmentation existing brands also typically offer regular and sugar free verities which have a sizeable share already in the market brand position typically emphasizes an energy boost metal alertness refreshment and taste this is why our product differentiation positioning is so important for the brand to be truly successful several opportunities for product differentiation exist one of which are the ingredients specifically a new brand could augment the energy and mental alertness benefits by increasing the amount of herbs vitamins and natural ingredients secondly no brand has positioned itself as an adult energy drink adults between the ages of  to  consumed energy beverages at a rate that was only slightly less than consumers under  thirdly the packaging all the energy brands on the market lacked meaningful differentiation they all looked the same with the product they felt it would be smart to introduce a new drink with a resealable lid something that would stand out in the crowd the current energy beverage consumer typically consists of males between the ages of  energy beverages are most often consumed in the afternoon the second most popular time of day is morning consumption convenience stores and supermarkets are the dominant offpremise retail channels for energy beverages in general energy beverage manufactures with a broad product line and an extensive distribution network have had the greatest success in gaining shelf space in supermarkets and mass merchandisers for their brand this would correlate with dr pepper snapple group inc strength of having great relationships with their vendors we would recommend that they follow suit with partnerships with the dominate offpremise retail channels but as a more health conscious beverage the solution that we came up with for the dr pepper snapple group was to incorporate all of these opportunities into a new product called ram which stands for real alive micronutrients the product’s target market will be adults ages   both males and females who are interested in their health in specific we are targeting the working middle class our average consumer would be someone working long hours that need constant energy throughout the day even after work when they need to go home and take care of their families they are constantly on the go and busy when developing a new product you must implement the marketing mix the first being the product ram energy drink our product is focused on providing the same alert and energized feeling as traditional energy drinks without including ingredients that have harmful side effects other drinks such as red bull can lead to dangers such as cardiac arrest headaches insomnia type two diabetes and many other health issues top  energy drink dangers our new product ram will be replacing ingredients that lead to these dangers with more vitamins for example our product will not include ingredients such as carnitine guarnana ginseng and ginko biloba all of which are commonly used in energy beverages but there presence is not clearly reflected on their labels instead they cover it up by listing them as “part of a  mg energy blend” these ingredients can be extremely dangerous higgens instead we will have ingredients such as iron biotin zinc omega  fatty acids antioxidants vitamins a b b b b b b b c d all of these attributes to healthy energy levels but are a more natural way of doing so another detail of ram will be lower calories right now out of the five leading companies in the energy beverage market not including sugar free products monster has the lowest calories being  per oz can we want our product ram to be around  calories per bottle with only about  grams of sugar compared to monster which has  grams of sugar ram will also only be made up of natural flavors with no added artificial flavors or colors added whereas the other lead competitors all ad coloring and most admit to adding artificial flavoring when some do not list the specification which usually means they are trying to hide something we want our customers to know every little ingredient that makes up ram and hopefully this will build trust and relationships in return many people are just now starting to notice all of the potential dangers that energy drinks contain which is why our product will stand out as a healthier choice that offers the same benefits the look of our product will be completely unlike any other energy drink which are usually unsealable cans ram will be sold in a  ounce recyclable cardboard bottle with a resealable screw on cap similar to those that vita coco coconut water uses this type of bottling will fit better with the target market’s lifestyle because the container will be easier to bring on the go with no spills or messes they are also able to drink some now and easily save the rest for later when designing the prototype of the bottle we choose the colors dark blue and black so that they would be gender neutral and attract the more mature market the label is also clear and easy to read we suggest that ram only starts off introducing two flavors and see how they perform and introducing a new flavor within the next  months of the campaign the two flavors to start with might be ram berry and citrus because they are common and consumers might be more willing to try from there they can extend the product line even further by offering a sugarfree option and even being sold in packs of four or large cases the next aspect of the marketing mix to look at with ram is pricing we think that it is best to price themselves competitively at about  a bottle which is only a few cents cheaper than drinks such as monster and amp depending on the location the third part of the marketing mix is place dr pepper snapple group inc has a wide range of strong relationships from bottlers and distributors to national retailers large food service and convenience stores such as  and their customers they also have strong relationships with some of the most important us retailers including walmart safeway kroger and target building on their current strength of market channels we felt that off premise retailers would represent the best choice for the product to be carried lastly we have to figure out the promotion that will be used for ram since our funds are low compared to competitors and we are going to avoid any conflict we will be focusing on giving out samples while the product is being first introduced we recommend the company hires sales reps to go to local grocery stores with whom they already are doing business with to give out samples to customers for them to try the new drink it would also be a good idea to promote the new brand at events such races athletic games and concerts that our target market would be attending this can be as simple as setting up a tent offering free samples and coupons we also recommend using social media as a platform because it is extremely cost efficient and we can easily select our target by means of analyzing the company’s strengths tactics opportunities weaknesses and threats we were able to come up with a product that would be successful dr pepper snapple group inc vision statement says “it is our vision to be the best beverage business in the americas our brands have been synonymous with refreshment fun and flavor for generations and our sales are poised to keep growing into the future” we feel that by building on their current strengths and marketing a product by means of differentiation through its ingredients demographic unisex packaging and partnerships with loyal vendors we will have a success with ram real alive micronutrients works cited higgens john “energy beverage content and safety”  print “top  energy drink dangers” caffeine
