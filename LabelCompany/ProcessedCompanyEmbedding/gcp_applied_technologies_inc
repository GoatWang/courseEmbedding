the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information

estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a positive surprise  of the time and best of all by using these
