structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships if you are looking for tax flexibility limited liability and the option to raise capital incorporation may be the best path for you the following are four of the major benefits of incorporationincreased credibilitybeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law by simply adding “inc” or “llc” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking fortax benefits corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses these writeoffs can be substantial since insurance travel and entertainment are deductions corporation owners are also free from paying certain selfemployment taxes which informal business owners must payasset protectionin the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts the owners are given limited liability status this means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts in the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation the owners’ personal assets are protectedperpetual lifespan if your business is incorporated it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership the transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers informal business structures are not perpetual entities so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell the business typically ceases to exist in its current form being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors incorporate today  or call  want to

our  step process why incorporate general faqs our guaranteethe benefits of incorporatingincorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships if you are looking for tax flexibility limited liability and the option to raise capital incorporation may be the best path for you the following are four of the major benefits of incorporationincreased credibilitybeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law by simply adding “inc” or “llc” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking fortax benefits corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses these writeoffs can be substantial since insurance travel and entertainment are deductions corporation owners are also free from paying certain selfemployment taxes which informal business owners must payasset protectionin the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts the owners are given limited liability status this means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts in the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation the owners’ personal assets are protectedperpetual lifespan if your business is incorporated it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership the transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers informal business structures are not perpetual entities so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell the business typically ceases to exist in its current form being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors incorporate today  or call  want to

searching for the best high speed internet deals in the industry there are a few common terms that you must know so you can select the best deal when selecting a highspeed internet service provider your primary concerns are internet speed data limits and network congestion cost is also important with so many providers offering high speed wifi no one should ever have to pay too much for internet in this article well review the most important considerations when choosing the best highspeed wifi package for your needs well also go over what weve found to be some of the best high speed internet deals ads related to internet service providers in my area official suddenlink website – order tv internet  phone suddenlinkcom bundle cable tv phone  internet switch up to our best line up ever comcast® business sale   visa card w any internet businesscomcastcom get a  visa card w any comcast business internet limited time offer if you consider any of these great deals we encourage you to visit these sites on your own to make sure theyre available in your area when visiting atts website we discovered that their high speed data plans include  gb of data monthly with a  overage charge for each  gb of data used over the limit depending on how fast you want your speed to be prices range for  per month to  per month depending on how many mbps that you select in your plan for a standalone internet plan you can select from  to  mbps per second in addition att offers larger data plans if you bundle your service with directv or subscribed to att uverse you may be able to get up to  gb of data monthly if you bundle your service another provider to consider if available in your area is cox cable cox boasts the fastest inhome wifi connection on their site are currently offering a  per month promotion for a  month period with a  year contract other plans are available that arrange from  to  but it is not clear as to how many gigabytes are included monthly but they indicate that their download speeds can be anywhere from  mbps per second lastly century link is offering standalone plans starting at  while boasting  mbps for its connection speed you can get a price as low as  per month if you choose to bundle your service autopay enrollment may also be required in order to get the special pricing obviously if you are searching for the best highspeed internet deal speed is a concern the speed of service is measured in mbps megabytes per second for most providers a higher mbps indicates a faster internet speed generally there are two types of internet speeds you have a download speed that indicates how fast information arrives to your computer and an upload speed that indicates how fast your internet connection delivers information from your computer thus when looking for the best highspeed internet connection you want to know what the mbps upload and download speeds to compare services adequately if you currently have an internet service and you are not sure of the speed of your connection there are several sites that will allow you to test your internet connection for free the sites speedtestnet and testmynet allow you to test your connections almost all internet service providers represent their internet storage with a common computing term that relate to the amount of data transmitted over the providers network the most common term that you will most frequently see on an internet providers website is gb or gigabyte most highspeed internet plans are tiered plans that designate a certain amount of gigabytes that can be used during the billing cycle a gigabyte measures the amount of data that is transferred over the internet connection and this includes both the uploading and downloading of data in addition you may come across a term called a tb or terabyte which has the same function but is a much larger allowance of data basically anything that you surf or do on the internet is considered transmitted data when you simply type in your favorite web browser and the page loads you have downloaded transmitted data if you are logged in via wifi on your cellphone and are simply sending emails from your gmail account you are uploading transmitted data thus it is important to know how much data your household actually uses before selecting a plan on most internet service providers websites you can find a tool that is generally called a data calculator that will allow you to select varying options that describe your internet usage the tool then computes your usage to give you the potential numerical range of data that you are actually using in your home we recommend that you use this number range in order to help select the proper data plan some but not all internet service providers charge overages once you have exceeded your data limits and this can result in a costly monthly bill others may opt to slow down your ability to transmit data once you have exceeded your limit instead of charging overages make sure to ask about the consequences of going over your data limits last but certainly not least of your concerns is potential network congestion when you sign up for service you will often be provided with a piece of equipment called a router the router is a box that controls your internet connections its purpose is to allow multiple devices to use the highspeed internet connection in your home at the same time whether its a cell phone or a personal computer an internet connection can be made through a wifi access point with the simple entering of the username and password of your home network normally the username ssid and password can be found on the router however there must be enough space on your network to allow the connection of multiple devices in addition your home internet connection is also competing with other home internet connections in the area the amount of space available is represented by a term called bandwidth the bandwidth that a service provider offers is also an important factor because it is an indicator of the potential amount of successful connections that can be made over your home network and how much data you may actually able to download and upload ask about it in conclusion there are far more options available to consumers besides the providers mentioned above take your time and visit each providers website and look closely at the details write a list of questions that are not immediately clear from the website and then call your potential new provider for further clarification before choosing a new service ads related to
