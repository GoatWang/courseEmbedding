otherwise successful investors in wall street’s long history many investors and companies have made successful investments that put them on the map and made them hundreds of millions of dollars  their success leaves people astounded and in all likelihood a bit envious but despite their prolific returns no one has a perfect investment record in the hunt for extraordinary profits an investor’s mistakes can lead to extraordinary losses and though it won’t make your stockpicking skills any better it’s nice to be reminded that even investing giants are still human beings here are just a few of the biggest investing mistakes from the past few decades carl icahn bets on blockbuster’s resilience and loses a skilled investor known for turning around failing businesses carl icahn is reported to have invested over  million in video rental giant blockbuster from –  icahn believed the shares to be severely undervalued but in reality the company was permanently losing its market share and was later forced to liquidate icahn ended up losing around  percent more than  million of his total investment by the time he threw in the towel in  the silver lining icahn recognized the value of video streaming service netflix which was largely responsible for blockbuster’s decline and quickly bought nearly  percent of the company when he sold just half of his shares in october  he pocketed over  million in profits warren buffett’s oil fiasco despite being the most successful investor of all time warren buffett has made a few errors in judgment his biggest mistake began in – when oil prices peaked across the world buffett known for his ability to pick out undervalued stocks made an uncharacteristic purchase of highly priced conocophillips stock his purchase was massive approximately  billion in shares as demand and prices fell following  the stock lost almost half its value although conocophillips somewhat recovered it is estimated that buffett lost at least  billion on his commodity speculation ltcm defeated by the russian winter in the s john meriwether and his hedge fund longterm capital management ltcm were astounding investors on wall street using detailed mathematical models and borrowing money to leverage their investments ltcm targeted small but predictable bond trades ltcm was rarely wrong and produced fantastic returns however in  ltcm made a  billion bet on russian bonds leveraging their money fold when the bonds went the wrong way later that year ltcm became destabilized and had to be bailed out by other wall street firms to avoid a meltdown in the bond market by the time meriwether dismantled ltcm in  it had lost some  billion bill ackman helms a sinking  jc penney an activist investor bill ackman is known for finding underperforming stocks and pushing their company profits to the limit in october  ackman’s hedge fund took a nearly  billion stake in the struggling jc penney and put ackman on the company’s board of directors however the changes made to the company were largely ineffective and the share price continued to plummet in less than three years ackman stepped down from the board and sold his fund’s shares in the company the resulting losses exceeded  million david bonderman’s bankrupt bank billionaire david bonderman has been known to find huge profits in scooping up companies on the brink of failure during the financial crisis the giant seattlebased bank washington mutual or “wamu” looked like a perfect buying opportunity for bonderman spearheaded by his renowned investment firm tpg capital investors dumped a total of  billion into the bank in april  however just five months later the fdic shut down wamu and took all its assets destroying its investment value investors lost every dollar they paid and tpg capital’s own  billion stake in the bank vanished overnight conclusion the history of investing is littered with hundreds of investors financiers and businesses that made big bets and lost these examples serve as a good reminder that all investments are uncertain even for the smartest investors in the world in investing success is not about being perfect but about getting more investments right than wrong as an investor who is not working with millions or billions you can only aim to avoid extremely risky investments and not get carried away when buying into an apparent opportunity last week’s highlights markets finished the week at a record high friday with the all major indices gaining a percent or more oil prices were up  janet yellen spoke in a dovish tone when speaking in front of congress she highlighted the strength of job growth and indicated the intent to wind down the fed’s  trillion balance sheet starting this fall her major worry is that inflation remains below the fed’s target of    low inflation coincides with a soft consumer price index cpi number and lagging real estate prices not good for economic growth china posted q gdp growth

the weekly view  tufton capital what’s on our minds nonfarm payrolls rose  in june beating economists’ expectations  unemployment remains near historic lows at  this came in well above economists’ predictions of  jobs april and may numbers were also revised upward a negative in friday’s report was the wage growth numbers which rose  from last year below estimates of  wage growth continues to be slow and is another indicator of lower than expected inflation economists believe low wage growth and inflation will give the fed an even greater case to continue to tighten monetary policy it is also important to realize these numbers are constantly revised so all interpretations should be taken with a grain of salt moving forward all eyes will be on wage growth and whether strong jobs numbers will have a positive effect on gdp growth which has been tepid another interesting topic is whether or not the natural employment rate is lower than once thought the fed believes the natural rate is somewhere between  economists normally believe inflation should “catch” soon after employment dips below the natural rate and that a shortage in the labor market should force wages higher   in theory this should cause the economy to start to overheat but this has yet to be seen in the current expansion  is the natural rate lower than once thought or is something else going on last week’s

and a general slowdown in the business world but instead of getting lulled into the “summertime blues” at tufton capital we are cranking up our research efforts with a full crew of summer interns at tufton our investment committee stays busy throughout the year as our five portfolio managers and two research associates conduct all the firm’s equity research in house  to stay ahead with our research efforts during the summer months it has long been a tradition for the firm to hire highly qualified summer interns to run valuations write reports and present their findings to our investment committee  it is important work that we believe benefits both the firm and our interns as they look to get into the investment business after college  many of the alumni from our internship program have gone on to land great jobs on wall street after college this year we are happy to have a crew of four interns joining us for the summer chris guidry is joining us from hood college where he is

states marine corps nick kuchar interned with the firm in  while he was at gilman and is joining us again this summer from the university of michigan nick is a member of the michigan interactive

will make its largest acquisition to date by acquiring whole foods for  billion by acquiring the store grocery network jeff bezos ceo of amazon is planning on amazon becoming a top five grocery retailer by  traditional grocers like krogers costco and walmart saw their shares sink on friday at the prospects of a pricing war and disruption in the industry this purchase should be a game changer for the grocery business like any merger or acquisition there will be some winners and some losers  as amazon continues to transform the way consumers shop they should benefit from more grocery options and a more efficient shopping experience which should save them time and money  the deal could end up being an unfortunate scenario for whole foods cashiers and other minimum wage employees as amazon will be looking to cut costs and optimize efficiency in brick and mortar stores amazon is known for waging fierce price wars and upending traditional logistics methods to cut costs market commentators have speculated that amazon will look to cut costs at the pricey chain by eliminating cashiers changing inventory and updating the stores’ approach as one might expect from amazon technology could play a large role last year amazon released a concept called “amazon go” where shoppers walk into an amazon grocery store check in with an app on their phone pick out what they want to take home and then simply walk out  amazon go stores can track which products you take off their shelves and automatically charge your account  amazon calls it “just walk out” technology  while it’s unclear if amazon will apply the concept in whole foods stores it’s likely we will be seeing some changes in our neighborhood whole foods stores click here to see a video on the “amazon go” concept last week’s highlights the sp  finished up  last week technology stocks continued their slide down  as fears continue to mount about the sector being overvalued at esque levels industrials  real estate  and utilities  were the winners of the week with tech  consumer staples  and materials  being the losers the federal reserve raised its benchmark interest rate to between  and  this is the second increase this year and fed chair janet yellen suggested that it will stick to plans to raise rates three times in  yellen also laid out a plan to gradually ‘normalize’ the fed’s  trillion balance sheet by not reinvesting the principle when the year treasury notes and mortgage backed securities come due travis kalanick the embattled ceo of uber announced an indefinite leave of absence

today and investors will be hungry for any information related to the extent and timing of the uk’s exit from the european union many economists are hoping the new agreement will at least partly maintain the uk’s participation in the european free trading area the white house will be holding a tech summit this week and the paris air show will be taking place all week the paris air show is a

moving megacap tech stocks in   the “fabulous five” includes facebook amazon apple microsoft and google the street is calling the highflying group “faamg”  combined the faamg stocks have added  billion in market value this year and even though these companies are only  of the number of companies in the sp  these top  tech stocks account for  of the market value weighting in the index last friday goldman sachs’ research department took a shot at the faamg highfliers noting that the overall return of the nasdaq and sp  is getting increasingly dependent on the faamg group  the report even went as far to compare the run up in these stocks to the euphoria in tech stocks before the burst of the dotcom bubble nearly  years ago  goldman analyst robert bourojerdi wrote “this out performance driven by secular growth and the death of the reflation narrative has created positions extremes factor crowding and difficulttodecipher risk narratives eg faamg’s realized volatility is now below that of staples and utilities” for investors friday’s report from one of wall street’s top firms was hard pill to swallow and the exuberance built in these companies’ share prices was interrupted  facebook was down  amazon was down  apple was down  microsoft was down  and alphabet was fell  clearly goldman’s research department is a bit worried the investors are getting caught up in the game of chasing growth in this small group of names even though these types of moves are exciting to follow we urge our readers to avoid getting caught up in the day to day media hype and remain focused on the longterm prospects of their investment portfolio  the tufton investment team continues to diligently monitor developments throughout the market and clients’ individual portfolios   last week’s highlights while financials had a great week due to a dodd frank repeal moving through the house of representatives a move friday by technology stocks drove the sp and nasdaq into the red nasdaq was pushed lower by note by goldman sachs that suggested investors are overestimating the stability and strength of many recent outperformers in the tech space this led to a quick selloff and profit

material or surprising and markets reacted positively in other news nordstrom is seeking to take itself private gm sided with management against activist investor david einhorn’s proposals and alibaba

increase rates by  basis points janet yellen will also hold a press conference afterwards which will be closely followed because it could shed light on the state of the us economy future fed rate hikes and if they will start to unwind the fed’s  trillion balance sheet the producers price index ppi and the consumers price index cpi will be reported tuesday and wednesday respectively  both are measures of inflation and it is estimated that each increased between  and  this past month to wrap up the week on friday the stock market will likely see increased volume because it is a

expire on the same day and the stock market is flooded by arbitrage traders seeking to exploit price disparities   continue reading → jun   the weekly view  tufton capital what’s on our minds at tufton we often bring in new accounts holding numerous mutual funds  it’s likely that the client’s previous advisor was ‘filling the buckets” by picking what they believed were the best funds for each category  it’s a common strategy that is not necessarily a bad one but we believe investors with sizable assets deserve a higher level of service a customized portfolio constructed with individual securities it’s commonly said that “diversification is the only free lunch in investing”  in its most basic sense diversification involves the accumulation of assets with negative or low correlations to reduce risk and increase potential return  at tufton we believe in diversification but we’re not for overdiversification or what famous fund manager peter lynch coined as “diworsification” the process of adding investments to one’s portfolio in such a way that the riskreturn tradeoff is worsened diworsification is investing in too many assets with similar correlations that will result in an averaging effect it occurs where risk is at its lowest level and additional assets reduce potential portfolio gains as well as the chances of outperforming a benchmark consider that the average mutual fund owns about  different stocks  if you own  to  different mutual funds do you know exactly what you own  an account invested in  different mutual funds may own over  different securities and you may even hold the same stocks in different funds  moreover the fund likely charges a management fee on top of the fee paid to the financial advisor playing “quarterback” and picking the funds  if an investor wants this type of broad diversification why not just purchase an index fund  it would be much cheaper at tufton we believe that an equity portfolio made up of  to  stocks is a sweet spot where portfolio managers can limit volatility stemming from each security companyspecific risk and still produce alpha in an account last week’s highlights stocks had a strong week as investors remain optimistic that improving economic statistics and corporate earnings will continue to gain positive momentum  even though it was a strong week overall individual sectors of the market did not all move higher energy and financial stocks declined last week while telecom shares led the market higher on friday the may jobs report showed that the us added only  jobs in may  the disappointing number did little to upset investors though and stocks reached alltime highs on friday  some investors believe that the disappointing number will persuade the federal reserve to hold off on increasing interest rates later this month  thus the anemic number may actually have been a positive for equities  since  the us economy has added  million jobs and the unemployment rate currently sits at      looking ahead there are numerous important events that will test the stock market this week the following economic data will be released this week monday nonfarm productivity unit labor costs ism

allegations that president trump’s campaign had improper contact with russian officials continue reading → may   the weekly view  tufton capital what’s on our minds are mounting student loans the next bubble many americans—specifically millennials—are being crushed under the weight of student loans currently outstanding student loan debt in the united states totals more than  trillion the average graduate from the class of  has over  in student loan debt stemming from this there are concerns that student loan debt could represent the next “bubble” for the economy — even drawing comparisons to the housing market collapse that led to the great recession just how does the current state of student loan debt compare to the collapse of the housing market understanding the student loans crisis it is no secret that the cost of college is rising at a seemingly unsustainable rate since  collegerelated costs have increased tenfold while inflation itself has only tripled additionally wage growth has only kept pace with inflation rapidly increasing tuition costs paired with low wage growth means that students must go further into debt while generally not benefiting from proportional salary growth aside from the debt itself the default rate on student loans is among the highest it has been in decades in fact the percentage of americans who were in default on their student loans increased by more than  percent from  to  given these factors it is easy to understand the concern that some have regarding how the student loans crisis may affect the economy comparing student loans to the housing market collapse of the many possible contributing factors to the housing market crisis there is one that sticks out as being remarkably similar to the current economic conditions surrounding student loan debt loan accessibility in the late s and early s the american government enabled low and middleincome families to access mortgages more easily than before between the american dream down payment assistance act and hud secretary andrew cuomo announcing a year plan to make  trillion available to lowand middleincome families mortgages were made available to more people according to us census data the median price of a home doubled between  and  from  to  the accessibility of student loans through the federal direct student loan program fdslp passed in  mirrors the proliferation of mortgages in the early s this program provided aid to many students who otherwise may not have had access to student loans per the government accountability office state funding for public colleges decreased by  percent from  to  over this same timeframe tuition increased by about  percent across all public colleges it is worth noting that a significant portion of these shifts took place from  to  which is the timeframe directly following the passing of the fdslp states have largely decreased funding to public universities and the onus has been shifted to families — either pay for education outofpocket with federal loans or some combination of the two though the decline of state funding and the increase in federal funding may not have a direct causation link stemming from the fdslp there is an observable correlation on a similar timeline the differences between the two though both mortgages and student loans represent a huge portion of our national debt the total amount of debt varies widely between the two in the midst of the housing market collapse mortgages comprised nearly  percent—or about  trillion—of all debt in the united states around that time the delinquency rate on mortgages peaked at about  percent comparatively student loans represented about  percent—or  trillion—of debt in the united states in  currently the delinquency rate on student loans is about  percent in terms of direct economic impact student loans represent a far smaller portion of the total debt in america than mortgages did nearly a decade ago though the delinquency rates are similar the total monetary value of debt for student loans is far lower than either mortgages today or at the height of the housing bubble the effect of high student loan defaulting could however create a ripple of economic and financial events much like how mortgage defaulting significantly affected many more aspects of the economy than just the housing market student loan defaulting could create unforeseen issues in the economy though the circumstances surrounding the housing market collapse and the student loan crisis may not be the exact same there are definite similarities between the two the ubiquity of individuals obtaining student loans as well as the lifechanging impact they have on the life of an average american evokes flashbacks to what preceded the great recession it seems unlikely however that a similar default rate on student loans would have a comparable impact on the economy only time will tell how the student loan crisis is handled in the meantime the rate at which americans are going into debt with student loans appears to exhibit no signs of slowing last week’s highlights it was a strong five days for us equity markets  us large cap stocks experienced significant gains upwards of  last week following the previous week’s apprehension regarding president trump’s relationship with russia and the firing of james comey from where we sit now the sp  is

week’s news and the market’s emotional response after months of remarkably low stock market volatility we got our fair share last week markets took their biggest hit of the year on wednesday when investors turned bearish as president trump fired fbi director james comey and it was reported that trump had asked him to drop an investigation into former national security advisor michael flynn’s dealings with russian officials  traders got anxious on the news seeing it as a threat to trump’s policy initiatives  after hovering around its lowest level for weeks the cboe volatility index vix surged  on wednesday while the hour news cycle may have suggested that the sky was falling on wednesday investors refocused on the stock market’s improving fundamentals thursday and friday  by the end of the week it was clear that the emotional reaction to wednesday’s market drop was more severe than the actual potential economic damage that the revelations may cause recent political events brexit china devaluing their currency the night of the us election and north korea concerns have not been able to interrupt the yearold bull market  in times like these where political events can cause media hysteria and drive the market one way or the other it’s important to remember that the market reflects the future expected earnings of companies seeing that sp  companies posted  earnings growth during the first quarter of  the labor market is strong the housing market is close to cycle highs and industrial production has picked up recently it’s not surprising to see resilience in the current market too put it another way it’s not all about president trump furthermore given the flat market we have been experiencing lately last week’s volatility may have seemed like a big deal but it shouldn’t surprise investors as this type of move is really not unusual  as jpmorgan pointed out last week stocks have averaged a drop of  at some point in each calendar year since  and have finished in the green  of those  years moral of the story last week don’t get caught up in the hype and stay focused on the long term     looking ahead this week as earnings season is coming to an end investors will shift their focus from individual companies’ first quarter results to macroeconomic data coming across the wire preliminary manufacturing pmi numbers will be released on tuesday investors will be looking for continued improvement in this number  investors will also look to the federal reserve’s may meeting minutes which are being reported on wednesday  on friday consumer

up to fulfill my retirement dreams will social security be enough to sustain me” unfortunately the answer to the latter question is “probably not” government assistance is not designed to sustain you through retirement so you must be proactive in saving for your future the good news for you is that with smart investing you will be better equipped to plan for a successful retirement investing for a sound future retirement is expensive there is no doubt about that many experts estimate that you will need  percent of your preretirement income  percent or more for lower earners to maintain your standard of living when you stop working it’s time to take charge of your financial future today below are some tips on how to maximize your retirement savings invest in your employer’s pretax savings plans such as a k contribute as much as you are financially able to responsibly and use the automatic deduction feature to place money into your retirement account at every pay period over time compound interest and tax deferrals will make a big difference in the amount you will accumulate place your money into an individual retirement account ira when you open an ira you have two basic options—a traditional ira or a roth ira in general traditional ira contributions are not taxed until the time of withdrawal whereas roth ira contributions are taxed immediately but not taxed at withdrawal keep in mind the aftertax value of your withdrawal will depend on inflation your tax bracket and the type of ira that you choose avoid dipping into your retirement savings as you will lose principal and interest and may lose tax benefits if you change jobs consider rolling over your savings directly into an ira or to your new employer’s pretax retirement plan start saving early—the

reading → may   the weekly view  tufton capital what’s on our minds president trump’s administration unveiled a proposal last wednesday that was purported to be the “biggest tax cut” in us history  after months of anticipation the white house released a onepage list of bullet points that amounted to less than  words  the tax plan was really more of an outline that painted with very broad strokes heavy on ambition but light on details  the major takeaway from the proposal was fewer tax brackets and fewer deductions if passed the plan would cut the number of income brackets from seven to three  the plan proposes marginal tax rates of   and a top line rate of   the plan would also cut the corporate tax rate from  to   to the chopping block go the alternative minimum tax and the “death tax” for wealthy individuals  trump’s proposal to cut corporate taxes should benefit us corporations’ bottom lines significantly we would expect reduced corporate taxes to then spur economic growth but increased use of “passthrough” businesses could also leave plenty of room for abuse  on the individual taxpayer side under trump’s plan taxpayers will no longer be allowed to deduct state and local taxes from their federally taxed income  this will hurt folks in blue states like maryland where they pay high state and local taxes  deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions are protected under trump’s plan of course there are some big questions surrounding trump’s tax proposal most importantly “will it make it through congress intact” we will have to wait and see the tax plan handed out before the start of a white house press briefing photographer andrew harrerbloomberg   last week’s highlights major indexes were up more than  last week on strong corporate earnings

anticipated april jobs report since trump took office unemployment has fallen from  in february to  in march investors will see if that trend continued with friday’s report  berkshire hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting will be held saturday  warren buffet will answer shareholders’ questions for six hours continue reading → apr   the weekly view  tufton capital what’s on our minds writing a post about french elections and the structure of the european union might be a bit overdone but that is what’s on not just our but everyone’s minds this week last july we wrote about brexit in our quarterly newsletter undoubtedly we’ll talk more about europe in the next one as well for now let’s do a quick refresher on how france’s elections seem to mean so much for europe and the us centrist candidate emmanuel macron pulled ahead in the weekend’s primary election results signaling his likely win in the runoff election the markets responded overwhelmingly positively with the euro’s value rising  on sunday against the dollar macron was so warmly welcomed by the markets because his opponent farright candidate marine le pen would mean further nationalist tumult in the eu and another step toward its breakup the european union is flawed to be sure we are not the first to point out that a monetary union everyone uses the euro without a fiscal union not everyone treats the euro the same in their budget means that some countries ie germany feel that they are subsidizing the bad financial habits of others also stirring europe’s electorate is the rise of nationalism not just in the eu but around the world france is especially pressured by these thoughts with the country having had far and away the most religiouslymotivated terrorist activity in the recent past the bbc shared the top five countries for terrorist arrests however the eu is at least for now the law of the land a disruption would call into question important trade agreements investment flows tariffs and more it’s not certain if each tradeoff would be good or bad for the us in the long run but that’s one thing the markets really hate uncertainty   last week’s highlights it was a choppy week in the markets as investors processed political headlines and first quarter earnings reports from various companies by the end of the week major indexes were in the green  investors are hanging in there even with tensions in north korea the french election and some doubts over whether president trump can deliver on campaign promises  on friday stocks bounced off session lows when trump announced he will make a

that will help keep them on track during their retirement years  by establishing a financial plan you will determine how your investment assets will fund your financial needs wants and wishes  seeing that saving enough for retirement is the most important part of the planning process review our  tips for saving for retirement below start now it’s a simple fact that the earlier you begin saving for retirement the more time your money has to earn interest and grow if you’ve put off saving until your s or later make up for lost time now by stashing away  to  percent of your salary plan your retirement needs if you want to retire at  and travel the globe or work for as long as you can but stick close to home how much money you need to retire is unique to you rather than relying on figures that suggest you’ll need  percent of your preretirement income to live comfortably later in life talk with your spouse and portfolio manager to settle on an amount to save that’s tailored to you learn about and contribute to your employer’s plan  if your employer offers a taxsheltered plan contribute at least enough to get the employer match your employer can provide you with a summary plan description which recaps your plan and vesting eligibility as well as an individual benefits statement consider saving “on the side” if you don’t have access to an employerbased plan contributing to a traditional or roth ira allows you to get similar tax benefits for your retirement savings even if you do contribute to an employerbased plan an ira can supplement those savings make saving as easy as possible  eliminate the need to move money from one account to another by setting a monthly savings goal and automating a deposit to that amount by making savings routine you are more likely to see your retirement nest egg grow to help boost your regular savings funnel any extra cash windfalls such as from a bonus or inheritance directly to your retirement savings increase savings as your near retirement your income will likely rise with age and experience so it makes sense to save more as you earn more after age  you will also be eligible for catchup contributions which allow you to contribute beyond the set limit for ks you can contribute an extra  while for iras you can contribute an extra  be an active participant in your retirement plan automating your retirement savings and

appropriate do you need to lower your exposure to risk by taking active control now you take control of creating the best retirement lifestyle possible decide on your social security strategy  social

keep in touch with your portfolio manager  the more intentional you are about how your assets are invested the more secure you can feel about them don’t touch your savings until retirement dipping into your retirement savings is a last resort in addition to harsh penalties you lose principal which in turn depletes interest earnings and tax benefits also if you switch jobs rollover your retirement account rather than “cashing out” preserving your retirement savings may be difficult when funds are tight but will benefit you when you truly need it most   last week’s highlights in an abbreviated week of trading due to friday’s holiday stocks declined roughly  in the face of global tensions with syria russia and north korea because of the international drama we saw a dip in bond yields as investors “flew to safety” and put more money into us treasuries  along with geopolitical pressure earnings season kicked off and investors weighed earnings reports from large us banks  wells fargo shares fell  after reporting a slowdown in their mortgage banking business  warren buffet’s berkshire hathaway said it was forced to sell more than  million shares of well fargo’s stock

your goal of owning a home you may be itching to jump into the real estate game again by buying a second home while interest rates are low it might make sense to buy a house to use as a vacation home a rental property or a home for retirement   the process of buying a second home is similar to the process you already undertook when you bought your first home but the mortgage and tax implications will be different  below we will discuss some of these differences financing the house at this point in your life you may have more cash to put toward a down payment or may even be able to buy a second home outright  while rates are still historically low it may make sense to finance a portion of the home  that being said mortgages for second homes are often more difficult to qualify for and require stricter terms interest rates expect your interest rate to be half a point to one point higher than it would be if you were buying a principle residence down payment for a principle residence most mortgage lenders prefer  percent down but don’t require it for a second home plan to put  to  percent down in order to qualify for financing credit score typically you must have a credit score of at least  or  to get the best loan terms some lenders will require an even higher score for second home mortgage applicants debt ratio the debt ratio the ratio of your debt payments to your monthly income that your second mortgage lender requires will probably be the same as for your first mortgage—typically no higher than  percent however when calculating the ratio for your second mortgage you’ll have to include house payments property taxes and insurance for two houses instead of just one tax implications your second home expenses will include additional property taxes if you’re renting it out you also need to pay income tax on your rent earnings but you could be eligible to deduct operating costs the sale of a second home is also subject to different capital gains tax rules than a primary residence property taxes the taxes you pay on either of your houses will depend on where they’re located how much land you own and how many improvements the house has had if you buy a rundown house with plans to make improvements expect your property tax bill to increase similarly if you buy a house that has seen major improvements since the last tax assessment be prepared for it to increase after you buy it you can write off your property taxes as a tax deduction just as you can with a first home income taxes if you rent your house out for more than  days and use it for personal reasons for less than  days of the year you must pay income tax on your rent earnings however when you claim rental income on your taxes you can also deduct rental expenses you incur from maintaining the property finding tenants etc interest deduction you can also deduct your mortgage interest payments on your second house if you itemize your tax return if the total value of both mortgages is below  million you can deduct your interest in full capital gains taxes when you sell your primary residence you won’t be taxed on capital gains up to  if you’re married or  if you’re single with a second home those limits don’t apply instead you’ll be taxed on the entirety of your capital gains to avoid paying high capital gains taxes you must have lived in your home for at least two years before selling if you’re selling a house that you used as a rental property or vacation home consider making it your primary residence for two years before selling to reap the tax benefits while owning a second home comes with added expenses the tax benefits provided by taking on a mortgage and potential appreciation of the home’s value can make it a sound investment strategy last week’s highlights while stocks lost only a few points last week there was no absence of market moving news  the federal reserve’s meeting minutes were released last week which revealed that the fed is beginning to determine when and how it will reduce the size of its balance sheet its ownership of bonds it purchased as part of its quantitativeeasing stimulus strategy  the year interest rates fell to as low as  last week receding from the  level reached in march after the fed announced its second rate hike in the span of three months  on friday we saw a weak jobs report that showed that the economy added only  jobs in march  the street had expected  new jobs  investors are blaming the weak job report on bad weather in march   looking ahead after being stuck in a state of suspended animation for the past few weeks the stock market will finally have its moment of truth as corporate earnings begin rolling out this week  jpmorgan chase and citigroup will kick things off on thursday  earnings report will reflect president trump’s first quarter as president so investors will be crunching the numbers to see if they support the post election rally  the bond market will close early

press contact us inside the investor’s mind blogquarterly newsletterinside the investor’s mind inside the investor’s mind january   tufton capital emotions substantially affect rational thinking when you let certain emotions fuel your investment decisions your portfolio could be in trouble understanding the psychological weaknesses that typically afflict investors will help you prevent them from damaging your own investment portfolio   what’s your risk tolerance before identifying the emotions that typically affect investors it’s first important to understand risk tolerance risk tolerance is how much unpredictability a person can financially—and especially “mentally”—handle in his or her investment portfolio   those with high risk tolerance—meaning they’re comfortable with investing in riskier markets—usually reap the highest longterm gains but their chances of suffering shortterm losses is just as high especially for retirement investments investors in their s usually have a higher risk tolerance than investors in their s who are nearing retirement aging investors usually have a low risk tolerance a shortterm loss could deplete their portfolio and they don’t have time on their side to recoup what they’ve lost   risk tolerance and emotions go hand in hand successful investors know their risk tolerance and how certain emotions can either increase or decrease the amount of risk they take   emotions that affect investors emotions are the part of your psyche that influences your motivation and behavioral tendencies in any area of our lives when emotions run high it causes our rational commonsense brains to shut down and prevents us from making rational decisions euphoria greed fear and regret are just a few of the emotions that affect investors and the decisions they make for their portfolios   euphoria optimism and overconfidence euphoria—the state of intense happiness and selfconfidence—gives an investor that surge of adrenaline euphoria causes investors to be more optimistic about the stock market and certain stock picks but the elation and pride from a gain can also prevent the investor from detecting risks as their selfconfidence increases investors tend to view themselves as more competent to choose the right stock picks than they really are many times overconfidence leads to greed   greed greed is the excessive desire that alters investors’ judgment leading them to poor decisions and irrational actions most people want to make as much money as they can in as little time and with as little effort as possible investors have the instinct to always try and get a little bit more but this “getrichquick” mentality can cause a frenzy in their portfolios not to mention the overall stock market   greed is not an easy emotion to overcome and it can be the foundation for reoccurring investment errors such as “following the herd” and jumping on the bandwagon of the latest investment fad or hanging on to stocks too long   fear on the opposite end of the spectrum from greed is fear an emotion just as debilitating to both investors and potential investors fear is an instinctual reaction to what someone perceives as an anticipated or actual threat it can cause investors to do any of the following sit on cash that should be invested sell winning stocks too soon or enter and exit the stock market too soon hold on to losing stocks too long or stay in the stock market too long   some people believe the stock market is too risky they would be unable to stomach the ups and downs of their investment losing and gaining money these individuals feel more comfortable protecting their money somewhere with very little risk such as a savings account little do they know that stockpiling their cash in a savings account is a risk too while their money is safe in the short term it’s not growing to meet the rate of inflation over time preparing for major life events living expenses in retirement and major purchases your money must grow to afford the higher price tag of these expenses in the future   those who actually do invest are also susceptible to fear paralyzed by the fear of making errors some investors either sell winning stocks too soon or hold on to losing stock positions that should be sold out because they’re afraid of losing money some studies show that the pain of losing a certain amount of money is actually greater than the pleasure derived from winning the same amount   regret who likes to admit they’re wrong no one for investors it’s difficult to admit they’re responsible for making poor decisions about stocks the pain of regret can cause investors to hold on to losing stocks too long or sell winning stocks too soon a loss of wealth can be so painful to your psyches that you want to make the pain go away quickly usually driven by fear investors will make any decision possible—however irrational it may be—to avoid experiencing regret   put your emotions in check it’s easier said than done but keeping your emotions in check will lead to personal investment success so how can you accomplish this   know you’re in control only you can prevent your emotions from clouding your investment decisions understand that once the emotion is released it’s difficult to contain identify your emotions before you act on them and take time to think things through before jumping on an investment decision   educate yourself understanding how the stock market works will decrease much of the fear and anxiety that comes with investing thoroughly research your investment and examine the history of the stocks you’re interested in don’t simply look at how a company is performing now analyze the history of the stock’s performance when you finally decide to buy select your investment based on facts not on speculative forecasts or because everyone else is buying them   choose an asset allocation mix that’s right for you this means diversifying your portfolio and finding that balance between riskier and conservative investments some investors build their portfolios largely out of stocks in order to have the best chance of providing a high return other investors buy mostly bonds and cash equivalents these are low risk but the returns are also very small to combat the risk of huge losses for both those with high and low risk tolerance investors diversify their portfolios by spreading their assets among different types of investments to minimize loss diversification is a reliable method to decrease risk while still getting solid returns   think long term avoid watching the daytoday peaks and plummets of your stock this can stress you out instead concentrate on the longterm performance of your entire portfolio   talk to tufton capital management we are here to discuss your personal financial goals and educate you on investment strategies to meet those goals share it tufton capital management  international circlesuite hunt valley md   infotuftoncapitalcom viewpoint quarterly

think the stock market will be in six months or a year the question implies that i am some sort of stock market astrologer and that would be very scary i just reply “i have no idea” in the short term i doubt that anybody has much of an idea where the stock market will go but over the last  years the market has provided an average total return of  compounded annually comprised of  price appreciation and  dividend yield but the market direction question is really trying to ask is how do you time the market when do you sell out and when do you buy in this strategy of market timing is fraught with risk and can be very dangerous the timing of the market requires two critical decisions when to get out and more importantly when to get back in the second decision when to reenter the

investors and companies have made successful investments that put them on the map and made them hundreds of millions of dollars  their success leaves people astounded and in all likelihood a bit envious but despite their prolific returns no one has a perfect investment record in the hunt for extraordinary profits an investor’s mistakes can lead to extraordinary losses and though it won’t make your stockpicking skills any better it’s nice to be reminded that even investing giants are still human beings here are just a few of the biggest investing mistakes from the past few decades carl icahn bets on blockbuster’s resilience and loses a skilled investor known for turning around failing businesses carl icahn is reported to have invested over  million in video rental giant blockbuster from –  icahn believed the shares to be severely undervalued but in reality the company was permanently losing its market share and was later forced to liquidate icahn ended up losing around  percent more than  million of his total investment by the time he threw in the towel in  the silver lining icahn recognized the value of video streaming service netflix which was largely responsible for blockbuster’s decline and quickly bought nearly  percent of the company when he sold just half of his shares in october  he pocketed over  million in profits warren buffett’s oil fiasco despite being the most successful investor of all time warren buffett has made a few errors in judgment his biggest mistake began in – when oil prices peaked across the world buffett known for his ability to pick out undervalued stocks made an uncharacteristic purchase of highly priced conocophillips stock his purchase was massive approximately  billion in shares as demand and prices fell following  the stock lost almost half its value although conocophillips somewhat recovered it is estimated that buffett lost at least  billion on his commodity speculation ltcm defeated by the russian winter in the s john meriwether and his hedge fund longterm capital management ltcm were astounding investors on wall street using detailed mathematical models and borrowing money to leverage their investments ltcm targeted small but predictable bond trades ltcm was rarely wrong and produced fantastic returns however in  ltcm made a  billion bet on russian bonds leveraging their money fold when the bonds went the wrong way later that year ltcm became destabilized and had to be bailed out by other wall street firms to avoid a meltdown in the bond market by the time meriwether dismantled ltcm in  it had lost some  billion bill ackman helms a sinking  jc penney an activist investor bill ackman is known for finding underperforming stocks and pushing their company profits to the limit in october  ackman’s hedge fund took a nearly  billion stake in the struggling jc penney and put ackman on the company’s board of directors however the changes made to the company were largely ineffective and the share price continued to plummet in less than three years ackman stepped down from the board and sold his fund’s shares in the company the resulting losses exceeded  million david bonderman’s bankrupt bank billionaire david bonderman has been known to find huge profits in scooping up companies on the brink of failure during the financial crisis the giant seattlebased bank washington mutual or “wamu” looked like a perfect buying opportunity for bonderman spearheaded by his renowned investment firm tpg capital investors dumped a total of  billion into the bank in april  however just five months later the fdic shut down wamu and took all its assets destroying its investment value investors lost every dollar they paid and tpg capital’s own  billion stake in the bank vanished overnight conclusion the history of investing is littered with hundreds of investors financiers and businesses that made big bets and lost these examples serve as a good reminder that all investments are uncertain even for the smartest investors in the world in investing success is not about being perfect but about getting more investments right than wrong as an investor who is not working with millions or billions you can only aim to avoid extremely risky investments and not get carried away when buying into an apparent opportunity last week’s highlights markets finished the week at a

industrial average and the sp  rose by  more than doubling their gains over the same period last year over on the nasdaq where hightechnology and highpublicity business models reign supreme the good

first half of  to around   on june  the standard  poor’s  reached an alltime high of   the dow jones industrial average and the nasdaq markets also hit record highs during the quarter  this strong performance has been accompanied by very low volatility  for example the stock market fell for three consecutive days just twice during the quarter  another positive mark was that the largest oneday drop in the sp  during the quarter was  on may  which more than recovered in the five trading days that followed  the lack of volatility in the stock market reflects the placid stable us economy  this year will mark the eighth consecutive year of economic growth falling in a tight range of  –  on the other side of the fence the bond market marched to the beat of a different drum during the quarter  shortterm interest rates moved higher in reaction to federal reserve policy but intermediate and longterm rates moved significantly lower  the yield on year us treasuries touched  approaching levels

securities and one goes bad it won’t sink your whole ship diversification is often called investing’s “free lunch” for good reason  you get the benefit of lower risk with little extra cost to you as the investor proper diversification isn’t always as straightforward and investors can get themselves into a mess while thinking they’re doing the right thing by holding lots of funds for example any investor choosing a mix of assets has certainly heard of diversification but while looking at a menu of  mutual funds how to diversify might not be so clear he or she might “wisely” choose several funds that look to be different looking at vanguard’s “stock funds” menu it would be easy to pick the following list of funds more… continue reading → jul   company spotlight bristolmyers squibb

june beating economists’ expectations  unemployment remains near historic lows at  this came in well above economists’ predictions of  jobs april and may numbers were also revised upward a negative in friday’s report was the wage growth numbers which rose  from last year below estimates of  wage growth continues to be slow and is another indicator of lower than expected inflation economists believe low wage growth and inflation will give the fed an even greater case to continue to tighten monetary policy it is also important to realize these numbers are constantly revised so all interpretations should be taken with a grain of salt moving forward all eyes will be on wage growth and whether strong jobs numbers will have a positive effect on gdp growth which has been tepid another interesting topic is whether or not the natural employment rate is lower than once thought the fed believes the natural rate is somewhere between  economists normally believe inflation should “catch” soon after employment dips below the natural rate and that a shortage in the labor market should force wages higher   in theory this should cause the economy to start to overheat but this has yet to be seen in the current expansion  is the natural rate lower than once thought or is something else going on last week’s highlights with a mix of strong economic data and geopolitical uncertainty markets eked out gains during the week of trading shortened by the july th holiday  both the sp  and dow jones remain up by more than  for the year  stocks had a good day friday after the june jobs report was

what’s on our minds one may associate the summer months with longer days beach vacations leisurely weekends and a general slowdown in the business world but instead of getting lulled into the

managers and two research associates conduct all the firm’s equity research in house  to stay ahead with our research efforts during the summer months it has long been a tradition for the firm to hire

the weekly view  tufton capital what’s on our minds on friday it was announced that amazon will make its largest acquisition to date by acquiring whole foods for  billion by acquiring the store grocery network jeff bezos ceo of amazon is planning on amazon becoming a top five grocery retailer by  traditional grocers like krogers costco and walmart saw their shares sink on friday at the prospects of a pricing war and disruption in the industry this purchase should be a game changer for the grocery business like any merger or acquisition there will be some winners and some losers  as amazon continues to transform the way consumers shop they should benefit from more grocery options and a more efficient shopping experience which should save them time and money  the deal could end up being an unfortunate scenario for whole foods cashiers and other minimum wage employees as amazon will be looking to cut costs and optimize efficiency in brick and mortar stores amazon is known for waging fierce price wars and upending traditional logistics methods to cut costs market commentators have speculated that amazon will look to cut costs at the pricey chain by eliminating cashiers changing inventory and updating the stores’ approach as one might expect from amazon technology could play a large role last year amazon released a concept called “amazon go” where shoppers walk into an amazon grocery store check in with an app on their phone pick out what they want to take home and then simply walk out  amazon go stores can track which products you take off their shelves and automatically charge your account  amazon calls it “just walk out” technology  while it’s unclear if amazon will apply the concept in whole foods stores it’s likely we will be seeing some changes in our neighborhood whole foods stores click here to see a video on the “amazon go” concept last week’s highlights the sp  finished up  last week technology stocks continued their slide down  as fears continue to mount about the sector being overvalued at esque levels industrials  real estate  and utilities  were the winners of the week with tech  consumer staples  and materials  being the losers the federal reserve raised its benchmark interest rate to between  and  this is the second increase this year and fed chair janet yellen suggested that it will stick to plans to raise rates three times in  yellen also laid out a plan to gradually ‘normalize’ the fed’s  trillion balance sheet by not reinvesting the principle when the year treasury notes and mortgage backed securities come due travis kalanick the embattled ceo of uber announced an indefinite leave of absence as the firm agreed to recommendations to conduct an independent review into its abrasive corporate culture that has led to a series of pr disasters mostly related to corporate sexism with half its csuite empty and operating at a  million loss uber is certainly going through growing pains oil prices plunged to their lowest levels in seven months after data from the international energy agency indicated that stockpiles of crude in america are falling by much less than had been expected and they do not expect the global supply glut in oil to ease this year looking ahead brexit talks begin today and investors will be hungry for any information related to the extent and timing of the uk’s exit from the european union many economists are hoping the new agreement will at least partly maintain the uk’s participation in the european free trading area the white house will be holding a tech summit this week and the paris air show will be taking place all week the paris air show is a perfect platform for aerospacedefense to showcase new technology so look for marketmaking news to come from this event the tech

capital what’s on our minds forget about fang there’s an updated group of market moving megacap tech stocks in   the “fabulous five” includes facebook amazon apple microsoft and google the street is calling the highflying group “faamg”  combined the faamg stocks have added  billion in market value this year and even though these companies are only  of the number of companies in the sp  these top  tech stocks account for  of the market value weighting in the index last friday goldman sachs’ research department took a shot at the faamg highfliers noting that the overall return of the nasdaq and sp  is getting increasingly dependent on the faamg group  the report even went as far to compare the run up in these stocks to the euphoria in tech stocks before the burst of the dotcom bubble nearly  years ago  goldman analyst robert bourojerdi wrote “this out performance driven by secular growth and the death of the reflation narrative has created positions extremes factor crowding and difficulttodecipher risk narratives eg faamg’s realized volatility is now below that of staples and utilities” for investors friday’s report from one of wall street’s top firms was hard pill to swallow and the exuberance built in these companies’ share prices was interrupted  facebook was down  amazon was down  apple was down  microsoft was down  and alphabet was fell  clearly goldman’s research department is a bit worried the investors are getting caught up in the game of chasing growth in this small group of names even though these types of moves are exciting to follow we urge our readers to avoid getting caught up in the day to day media hype and remain focused on the longterm prospects of their investment portfolio  the tufton investment team continues to diligently monitor developments throughout the market and clients’ individual portfolios   last week’s highlights while financials had a great week due to a dodd frank repeal moving through the house of representatives a move friday by technology stocks drove the sp and nasdaq into the red nasdaq was pushed lower by note by goldman sachs that suggested investors are overestimating the stability and strength of many recent outperformers in the tech space this led to a quick selloff and profit taking across the board in tech and ended with the technology select sector spdr etf xlf slumping  energy stocks had a volatile week dropping in value midweek but recovered on friday  the price of wti oil moved to its lowest level since november on higher than expected inventory levels as supply and demand forces continue to duel it out causing uncertainty in the energy sector political forces continued to drive the narrative and influence the markets but last week economic forces took the wheel in moving the needle the comey testimony before congress did not reveal anything particularly material or surprising and markets reacted positively in other news nordstrom is seeking to take itself private gm sided with management against activist investor david einhorn’s proposals and alibaba surged on raised guidance   looking ahead all eyes will be on the federal reserve this week when they decide wednesday whether to raise short term interest rates the street is expecting the fed to increase rates by  basis points janet yellen will also hold a press conference afterwards which will be closely followed because it could shed light on the state of the us economy future fed rate hikes and if they will start to unwind the fed’s  trillion balance sheet the producers price index ppi and the consumers price index cpi will be reported tuesday and wednesday respectively  both are measures of inflation and it is estimated that each increased between  and  this past month to wrap up the week on friday the stock market will likely see increased volume because it is a ‘triplewitching’ day  triple witching days happen four times a year in march june september and december it is a day when contracts for stock index options stock index futures and stock options all expire on the same day and the stock market is flooded by arbitrage traders seeking to exploit price disparities   continue reading → jun   the weekly view  tufton capital what’s on our minds at tufton we often bring in new accounts holding numerous mutual funds  it’s likely that the client’s previous advisor was ‘filling the buckets” by picking what they believed were the best funds for each category  it’s a common strategy that is not necessarily a bad one but we believe investors with sizable assets deserve a higher level of service a customized portfolio constructed with individual securities it’s commonly said that “diversification is the only free lunch in investing”  in its most basic sense diversification involves the accumulation of assets with negative or low correlations to reduce risk and increase potential return  at tufton we believe in diversification but we’re not for overdiversification or what famous fund manager peter lynch coined as “diworsification” the process of adding investments to one’s portfolio in such a way that the riskreturn tradeoff is worsened diworsification is investing in too many assets with similar correlations that will result in an averaging effect it occurs where risk is at its lowest level and additional assets reduce potential portfolio gains as well as the chances of outperforming a benchmark consider that the average mutual fund owns about  different stocks  if you own  to  different mutual funds do you know exactly what you own  an account invested in  different mutual funds may own over  different securities and you may even hold the same stocks in different funds  moreover the fund likely charges a management fee on top of the fee paid to the financial advisor playing “quarterback” and picking the funds  if an investor wants this type of broad diversification why not just purchase an index fund  it would be much cheaper at tufton we believe that an equity portfolio made up of  to  stocks is a sweet spot where portfolio managers can limit volatility stemming from each security companyspecific risk and still produce alpha in an account last week’s highlights stocks had a strong week as investors remain optimistic that improving economic statistics and corporate earnings will continue to gain positive momentum  even though it was a strong week overall individual sectors of the market did not all move higher energy and financial stocks declined last week while telecom shares led the market higher on friday the may jobs report showed that the us added only  jobs in may  the disappointing number did little to upset investors though and stocks reached alltime highs on friday  some investors believe that the disappointing number will persuade the federal reserve to hold off on increasing interest rates later this month  thus the anemic number may actually have been a positive for equities  since  the us economy has added  million jobs and the unemployment rate currently sits at      looking ahead there are numerous important events that will test the stock market this week the following economic data

the weekly view  tufton capital what’s on our minds are mounting student loans the next bubble many americans—specifically millennials—are being crushed under the weight of student loans currently outstanding student loan debt in the united states totals more than  trillion the average graduate from the class of  has over  in student loan debt stemming from this there are concerns that student loan debt could represent the next “bubble” for the economy — even drawing comparisons to the housing market collapse that led to the great recession just how does the current state of student loan debt compare to the collapse of the housing market understanding the student loans crisis it is no secret that the cost of college is rising at a seemingly unsustainable rate since  collegerelated costs have increased tenfold while inflation itself has only tripled additionally wage growth has only kept pace with inflation rapidly increasing tuition costs paired with low wage growth means that students must go further into debt while generally not benefiting from proportional salary growth aside from the debt itself the default rate on student loans is among the highest it has been in decades in fact the percentage of americans who were in default on their student loans increased by more than  percent from  to  given these factors it is easy to understand the concern that some have regarding how the student loans crisis may affect the economy comparing student loans to the housing market collapse of the many possible contributing factors to the housing market crisis there is one that sticks out as being remarkably similar to the current economic conditions surrounding student loan debt loan accessibility in the late s and early s the american government enabled low and middleincome families to access mortgages more easily than before between the american dream down payment assistance act and hud secretary andrew cuomo announcing a year plan to make  trillion available to lowand middleincome families mortgages were made available to more people according to us census data the median price of a home doubled between  and  from  to  the accessibility of student loans through the federal direct student loan program fdslp passed in  mirrors the proliferation of mortgages in the early s this program provided aid to many students who otherwise may not have had access to student loans per the government accountability office state funding for public colleges decreased by  percent from  to  over this same timeframe tuition increased by about  percent across all public colleges it is worth noting that a significant portion of these shifts took place from  to  which is the timeframe directly following the passing of the fdslp states have largely decreased funding to public universities and the onus has been shifted to families — either pay for education outofpocket with federal loans or some combination of the two though the decline of state funding and the increase in federal funding may not have a direct causation link stemming from the fdslp there is an observable correlation on a similar timeline the differences between the two though both mortgages and student loans represent a huge portion of our national debt the total amount of debt varies widely between the two in the midst of the housing market collapse mortgages comprised nearly  percent—or about  trillion—of all debt in the united states around that time the delinquency rate on mortgages peaked at about  percent comparatively student loans represented about  percent—or  trillion—of debt in the united states in  currently the delinquency rate on student loans is about  percent in terms of direct economic impact student loans represent a far smaller portion of the total debt in america than mortgages did nearly a decade ago though the delinquency rates are similar the total monetary value of debt for student loans is far lower than either mortgages today or at the height of the housing bubble the effect of high student loan defaulting could however create a ripple of economic and financial events much like how mortgage defaulting significantly affected many more aspects of the economy than just the housing market student loan defaulting could create unforeseen issues in the economy though the circumstances surrounding the housing market collapse and the student loan crisis may not be the exact same there are definite similarities between the two the ubiquity of individuals obtaining student loans as well as the lifechanging impact they have on the life of an average american evokes flashbacks to what preceded the great recession it seems unlikely however that a similar default rate on student loans would have a comparable impact on the economy only time will tell how the student loan crisis is handled in the meantime the rate at which americans are going into debt with student loans appears to exhibit no signs of slowing last week’s highlights it was a strong five days for us equity markets  us large cap stocks experienced significant gains upwards of  last week following the previous week’s apprehension regarding president trump’s relationship with russia and the firing of james comey from where we sit now the sp  is up nearly  for the year thanks to a sense of faith in the trump administration’s policies on infrastructure spending and tax reform investors were happy to hear that us gdp was revised up from  to  for the first quarter thanks to strong consumer spending on the international side markets have been improving rapidly  developedmarket equities eafe have seen gains above  this year  emergingmarket stocks have increased  since the beginning of the year looking ahead us markets were closed on monday in observance of memorial day  even though it’s an abbreviated week there is plenty of economic data coming across the wire this week on tuesday we will hear results from the conference board’s consumer confidence survey on wednesday investors will be examining pending home sales data vehicle sales and construction spending data will be released on thursday  to wrap up the week on friday we will get may’s jobs report  investors are expecting  job gains and wage growth of  yearoveryear in may continue reading → may   the weekly view  tufton capital what’s on our minds last week volatility returned to the markets so this week we will forgo our usual “last week” section and focus on last week’s news and the market’s emotional response after months of remarkably low stock market volatility we got our fair share last week markets took their biggest hit of the year on wednesday when investors turned bearish as president trump fired fbi director james comey and it was reported that trump had asked him to drop an investigation into former national security advisor michael flynn’s dealings with russian officials  traders got anxious on the news seeing it as a threat to trump’s policy initiatives  after hovering around its lowest level for weeks the cboe volatility index vix surged  on wednesday while the hour news cycle may have suggested that the sky was falling on wednesday investors refocused on the stock market’s improving fundamentals thursday and friday  by the end of the week it was clear that the emotional reaction to wednesday’s market drop was more severe than the actual potential economic damage that the revelations may cause recent political events brexit china devaluing their currency the night of the us election and north korea concerns have not been able to interrupt the yearold bull market  in times like these where political events can cause media hysteria and drive the market one way or the other it’s important to remember that the market reflects the future expected earnings of companies seeing that sp  companies posted  earnings growth during the first quarter of  the labor market is strong the housing market is close to cycle highs and industrial production has picked up recently it’s not surprising to see resilience in the current market too put it another way it’s not all about president trump furthermore given the flat market we have been experiencing lately last week’s volatility may have seemed like a big deal but it shouldn’t surprise investors as this type of move is really not unusual  as jpmorgan pointed out last week stocks have averaged a drop of  at some point in each calendar year since  and have finished in the green  of those  years moral of the story last week don’t get caught up in the hype and stay focused on the long term     looking ahead this week as earnings season is coming to an end investors will shift their focus from individual companies’ first quarter results to macroeconomic data coming across the wire preliminary manufacturing pmi numbers will be released on tuesday investors will be looking for continued improvement in this number  investors will also look to the federal reserve’s may meeting minutes which are being reported on wednesday  on friday consumer sentiment data will be reported along with the durable goods number continue reading → may   the weekly view  tufton capital what’s on our minds have you ever asked yourself “will i have enough saved up to fulfill my retirement dreams will social security be enough to sustain me” unfortunately the answer to the latter question is “probably not” government assistance is not designed to sustain you through retirement so you must be proactive in saving for your future the good news for you is that with smart investing you will be better equipped to plan for a successful retirement investing for a sound future retirement is expensive there is no doubt about that many experts estimate that you will need  percent of your preretirement income  percent or more for lower earners to maintain your standard of living when you stop working it’s time to take charge of your financial future today below are some tips on how to maximize your retirement savings invest in your employer’s pretax savings plans such as a k contribute as much as you are financially able to responsibly and use the automatic deduction feature to place money into your retirement account at every pay period over time compound interest and tax deferrals will make a big difference in the amount you will accumulate place your money into an individual retirement account ira when you open an ira you have two basic options—a traditional ira or a roth ira in general traditional ira contributions are not taxed until the time of withdrawal whereas roth ira contributions are taxed immediately but not taxed at withdrawal keep in mind the aftertax value of your withdrawal will depend on inflation your tax bracket and the type of ira that you choose avoid dipping into your retirement savings as you will lose principal and interest and may lose tax benefits if you change jobs consider rolling over your savings directly into an ira or to your new employer’s pretax retirement plan start saving early—the sooner you are able to start saving the more time your money has to grow devise a savings plan stick to it and set goals for the future take advantage of employer matching funds if you are able most employersponsored plans require the employer to match a certain percentage of your income this may be the closest thing to free money so take advantage study your investment choices carefully the more you know about investing the more likely you will choose wisely learn as much as you can about your plan’s administrative fees investment fees and services fees to avoid reducing the amount of your retirement benefits unnecessarily investing a predetermined amount on a regular basis through your company k a roth ira etc makes solid retirement sense for more information contact us to learn more about how our solutions can help you prepare for your future   last
