the future at the same time new health technologies pose significant challenges for governments particularly in relation to ensuring the technologies are safe effective and provide appropriate value for public money to guard against the possible dangers arising from new health technologies and to maximize the benefits all european governments regulate their development marketing and public financing in addition several international institutions operating at european level in particular the european union the council of europe and the european patent office have become involved in the regulation of new health technologies they have done so both through traditional command and control legal measures and through other regulatory mechanisms including guidelines soft law steering through redistribution of resources and private or quasiprivate regulation this collection analyses european law and its relationships with new health technologies it uses interdisciplinary insights particularly from law but also drawing on regulation theory and science and technology studies to shed new light on some of the key defining features of the relationships and especially the roles of risk rights ethics and markets the collection explores the way in which european laws engagement with new health technologies is to be legitimized and discusses the implications for biological or
