description crossreference this application claims priority under  usc § e to us provisional applications ser nos  and  filed on apr   and apr   respectively the disclosures of these applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entiretybackground of the invention  field of the invention the present invention is directed to certain hydroxamate derivatives that are useful in the treatment of hepatitis c these compounds are also inhibitors of histone deacetylase and are therefore useful in the treatment of diseases associated with histone deacetylase activity pharmaceutical compositions and processes for preparing these compounds are also disclosed  state of the art hepatitis c chronic hepatitis c is a slowly progressive disease having a significant impact on morbidity and mortality while many patients who contract hepatitis c will have sub clinical or mild disease at least  of the individuals who contract hcv develop chronic infection and hepatitis twenty to fifty percent of these eventually progress to cirrhosis and  develop liver cancer hoofnagle j h  hepatology  ss there are an estimated  million hcv carriers worldwide and hcvassociated endstage liver disease is now one of the leading cause of liver transplantation in the united states alone hepatitis c is responsible for  to  deaths annually at the present time interferonαbribavirin combination therapy is the only available treatment sustained virologic response to ifnαb ribavirin combination therapy occurs in about  of those treated for those patients who fail interferonαbribavirin combination therapy there is currently no alternative to prevent the progression of liver disease thus a need exists for alternative therapies for the treatment of chronic hcv infection the present invention fulfills this need histone deacetylases interest in histone deacetylase enzymes hdacs as targets for pharmaceutical development has centered on the role of hdacs in regulating genes associated with cellcycle progression and the development and progression of cancer reviewed in kramer et al  trends endocrinol metab  several studies have shown that treatment of various cell lines with hdac inhibitors leads to hyper acetylation of histone proteins and cellcycle arrest in late g phase or at the gm transition genes involved in the cell cycle that have been shown to be up regulated by hdac inhibitors include p p p and cyclin e cyclin a and cyclin d have been reported to be down regulated by hdac inhibitors in tumor cell lines several studies have shown that treatment with hdac inhibitors can lead to growth inhibition growth arrest terminal differentiation andor apoptosis in vivo studies have demonstrated growth inhibition of tumors and a reduction in tumor metastasis as a result of treatment with hdac inhibitors the clearest link between abnormal hdac activity and cancer occurs in acute promyelocytic leukemia in this condition a chromosomal translocation leads to the fusion of the retinoic acid receptor rarα with the promyelocytic leukemia pml or promyelocytic leukemia zincfinger plzf proteins both pmlrarα and plzfrarα promote the progression of leukemia by repressing retinoic acidregulated genes through the abnormal recruitment of smrtmsinhdac complex lin et al  nature  grignani et al  nature  whereas the pmlrarα form of the disease is treatable with retinoic acid the plzfrarα form is resistant to this treatment for a patient with the retinoic acidresistant form of the disease the addition of the hdac inhibitor sodium butyrate to the dosing regimen led to complete clinical and cytogenic remission warrell et al  j natl cancer inst  hdacs have also been associated with huntingtons disease steffan et al nature  “histone deacetylase inhibitors arrest polyglutaminedependent neurodegeneration in drosophila” in summary an increase in hdac activity contributes to the pathology andor symptomatology of a number of diseases accordingly molecules that inhibit the activity of hdac are useful as therapeutic agents in the treatment of such diseases summary of the invention in a first aspect this invention provides a

dioxane to provide hnacetyllysamc as a white solid to a solution of hnacetyllysamc in dmf  ml was added acglyalaoh  mg  mmol using pybop  mg  mmol hobt  mg  mmol and nmm  ml  mmol the reaction mixture was stirred for  h and monitored by mslc for the presence of hnacetyllysamc additional amounts of pybop  mg  mmol hobt  mg  mmol and nmm  ml  mmol was added and the stirring was continued for additional  h after which the product was isolated in quantitative yield biological examples example  inhibition of hdac in vitro the hdac inhibitory activity of the compounds of this invention in vitro was determined as follows measurements were performed in a reaction volume of  μl using well assay plates hdac  pm final concentration in reaction buffer  mm hepes  mm kcl  tween  dmso ph  was mixed with inhibitor at various concentrations and allowed to incubate for  minutes after which trypsin and acetylglyalanacetyllysamc were added to final concentrations of  nm and  μm respectively to initiate the reaction negative control reactions were performed in the absence of inhibitor in replicates of eight the reactions were monitored in a fluorescence plate reader after a  minute lag time the fluorescence was measured over a  minute time frame using an excitation wavelength of  nm and a detection wavelength of  nm the increase in fluorescence with time was used as the measure of the reaction rate inhibition constants were obtained using the program batchki kuzmic et al anal biochem    most of the compounds of this invention had a ki of  nm example  cell proliferation assay in

containing vv fetal bovine serum  mm lglutamine  mm sodium pyruvate  unitsml penicillin and  μgml streptomycin at ° c in  co humidified atmosphere cells were cultured in cm culture flasks and subcultures were established every  to  days so as not to allow the cells to exceed  confluence hcti  cells were harvested for proliferation assays by trypsinization  trypsin mm edta washed twice in culture medium resuspended in appropriate volume of medium and then counted using a hemacytometer cells were seeded in wells of flatbottom well plates at a density of  cellwell in  μl cells were allowed to attach for  to  hours at ° c compounds were diluted from  mm stock solutions in dmso serial fold dilutions were performed in medium containing  dmso in wells in triplicate of a well ubottom plates starting with a  μm solution after dilutions were completed  μl of each compound dilution in triplicate was transferred to designated triplicate wells of the well plate containing cells in  μl of medium final concentrations of the doseresponse for compounds in assay plates ranged from  to  μm control wells cells with no treatment received  μl of  dmso in culture medium wells containing medium with no cells served as the background wells cells were cultured with the compounds for  and  hours at ° c in a humidified co incubator cell proliferation was assessed by measuring fluorescence after the addition of the fluorogenic redox indicator alamar blue™ biosource international ten μl of alamar blue™ was added to each well of the well plates  to  hours prior to the end of the incubation period assay plates were read in a fluorescence plate reader excitation  nm emission  nm g values concentration at which the growth of the tumor cells was inhibited by  for compounds were determined by plotting the percent control fluorescence against the logarithm of the compound concentration the compounds of this invention inhibited the growth of the tumor cells pharmaceutical

climbing equipment can result in a fall or serious injury height is referring to the actual ladder height extension ladders should be  to  feet longer than the highest support or contact point which may be the wall or roof line the highest standing level is four rungs down from the top the highest permitted standing level on a stepladder is two steps down from the top reach height is the maximum
