december   by pdd hot isostatic pressing hip is a manufacturing process used to reduce the porosity of metals and increase the density of many ceramic materials this improves the material’s mechanical properties and workability hot isostatic processing hip subjects parts to the simultaneous application of heat and high pressure in an inert gas atmosphere the pressure is uniform in all directions isostatic  in  years the process has moved from a laboratory curiosity to an important commercial process hiping currently is used most widely in the following applications upgrading castings hiping closes internal porosity in sand and investment castings this improves fatigue and fracture properties and reliability in general it allows castings to be used in critical applications heretofor reserved for forgings consolidation of powders metals ceramic and composite powders particularly those with poor cohesion as powder are compacted to full density by hiping these may be near net shape parts or billets for further work by forging or rolling dfftusion bonding the hip process grew out of a process for diffusion bonding corrosion resistant cladding on nuclear fuel elements structural ceramics hiping is used to produce nearnet shape parts from structural ceramics like silicon nitride and silicon carbide improvement of fatiguedamaged parts certain types of fatigue damage can be healed by hiping thus extending the life of aircraft components freedom in design the hip technology makes it possible to produce metal components unobtainable by other means designs with complex geometry and high performance requirements can be produced without weld joints ie  valve bodies can be produced with flanges without welding reduction in welding the ability to produce metal components with more complex geometry reduces the number of critical and costly weld joints considerably the reduction in welding reduces the need for time consuming on site welding and weld joint inspection material savings net near shape processing reduces material shavings complex components often require a lot of machining resulting in costly material shavings net near shape processing reduces the need for machining significantly isotropic mechanical properties hipmetal has the same properties in all directions this is due to the fine and uniform grain size material produced by traditional methods have texture that gives rise to different mechanical values depending on the direction in hipmaterial all directions are good directions minimized hisc problems the probability of hydrogen induced stress cracking hisc is virtually eliminated the fine grain structure of hipmetal greatly reduces the possibility of hisc narrow scatter band of mechanical properties scatter in the mechanical properties are much lower than castings and forgings the mechanical properties of a specific steel grade will vary across different production series the reason being uncontrollable parameters that influence the final result the variation in the mechanical properties are lower for hipmetal compared to metal produced by forging or casting better ultrasonic inspecatbility heavy sections can be inspected for inner defects by ultrasonic testing hipmetal has a finer grain structure compared to metal produced by traditional methods especially in thicker sections a coarse grain structure produces static thereby preventing ultrasonic testing hipmetals finer grain size increases the possibility of ultrasonic testing cladding the production method makes it possible to produce components consisting of layers of different steel grades cladding offers an additional dimension to the freedom in design   however isostatic pressing is applicable in general only to small production quantities typically less than  pieces annually it is a more costly method than other pm processes due to its slow processing speed and the need for expendable tooling lastly it is a nearnet shape process technology suited to parts with much wider tolerance requirements than other pm processes can produce assignment  new design of fingernail clipper posted on november   by pdd

selection method posted on november  november   by pdd pugh matrix pm what is it and what does it do the pugh matrix pm is a type of matrix diagram that allows for the comparison of a number of design candidates leading ultimately to which best meets a set of criteria it also permits a degree of qualitative optimization of the alternative concepts through the generation of hybrid candidates the pugh matrix is easy to use and relies upon a series of pairwise comparisons between design candidates against a number of criteria or requirements one of its key advantages over other decisionmaking tools such as the decision matrix is its ability to handle a large number of decision criteria overview the basic concept of a pugh matrix is both simple and elegant figure  shows a completed pugh matrix that has been used to evaluate and select from a number of design alternatives figure  example of a completed pugh matrix figure  shows a completed pugh matrix for four candidate design concepts called a b c and d which can be found along the top of the matrix these concepts have been evaluated against  criteria in constructing a pugh matrix one design concept in this example “design concept a” is selected as the “baseline” this baseline is score as “s” against all of the criteria the other candidate design concepts are then compared in a pairwise fashion against design concept a for each of the criteria if a candidate design concept is better than the baseline a “” is entered in the appropriate cell worse than the baseline a “” is entered in the appropriate cell the same than the baseline a “s” is entered in the appropriate cell hence in figure  design concept b is better than design concept a baseline for criteria  design concept b is worse than design concept a baseline for criteria  design concept b is the same as design concept a baseline for criteria  the overall evaluation is made by adding the “” and ““ for each design concept the pugh matrix can also be used to perform qualitative optimization by combining the candidate concept designs to form hybrid candidates figure  shows two such hybrids “concept bc” and “concept bd” the pugh process the process for constructing a pugh matrix comprises five steps this assumes that alternative candidate design options or decision options have been determined step  identify and clearly define the criteria for selection typically when using a pugh matrix to select between a number of candidate design options the design requirements can be used either in part or in whole ideally the design requirements should reflect both the usercustomer as well as other key stakeholders including internal stakeholders the robustness and validity of the outcome is fundamentally dependent on an appropriate set of criteriarequirements rushing this step usually results in a non robust outcome that is challenged and overturned step  use one candidate design option as the baseline and core all criteriarequirements as „s‟ some people prefer to use an o for this baseline if appropriate a good choice is to use the previous design for the baseline because it exists and therefore its performance should be reasonably well known step  compare each candidate design option against the baseline design criteria by criteria or requirement by requirement and decide a “pairwise score with s  same   better –  worse it is also possible to add extra levels of discrimination by using   much better —  much worse some people use a  to  scale where the baselinesame is a  with  and  being much worse and worse respectively and  and  being better and much better respectively step  for each candidate design option the total score can be calculated by summing the number of ‟s and –„s the highest ranked score is the “winner” but use common sense – don‟t just select “highest” ranked concept step  having scored each candidate design option consider hybrids by combining where possible the best from each alternative this is form of qualitative optimization step  make the decision and record reasons behind decisions quite often with a pugh matrix there is no clear “winner” but there is often a clear “loser” in such cases perform a sanity check does the decision make sense and remove the losing option at this point the criteriarequirements can be weighted to give better differentiation typically the weighting is on a  to  scale with  the lowest and  the highest weighting if there is still no clear winner the matrix is basically saying that there is not enough information to discriminate between the options in such cases it will be necessary to refine the criteriarequirements use an alternative selection approach perform more work to gain the information to be able to select between the options it is also recommended at this point to undertake a sensitivity analysis this can be performed in many ways that include flexing the importance numbers by ±  and monitoring the ranking of the candidates removing criteriarequirements from the assessment and monitoring the ranking of candidates reference the system engineering tool box by dr stuart burge pugh matrix for drinking cup search
