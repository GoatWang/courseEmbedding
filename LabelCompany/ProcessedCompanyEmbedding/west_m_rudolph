future is at cornerback illinois senior cornerbackreceiver terry hawthorne east st louis is on the paul hornung award watch list an endoftheseason honor that goes to the most versatile college football player in the nation hawthorne considers himself a cornerback first and feels that is where is longrange playing time will be “we’re short on receivers we have a need  but at the end of the day i know i’ll end up being a corner in the nfl” hawthorne recently told gatehouse news services firstyear illinois coach tim beckman plans on using hawthrone a former standout wide receiver at east st louis on both sides of the ball due to the illini’s lack of depth when it comes to passcatchers “i’m not a selfish player” said hawthorne who had a teambest three interceptions and was third in solo tackles “whatever they give me i’ll take it just make the most of it” at east st louis hawthorne twice led the southwestern conference in receiving yardage his  career yards ranks behind only

history lubelleville opens at  pm sept  against avila kan university “at this point we know we have a long way to go we just don’t have a long time to get there” fisher said “we’re focusing on fundamentals and getting each guy to know their assignment” fisher was named coach six months ago since then he recruited  players and assembled a coaching staff “our first week of camp went extremely well” he said “we were able to get a great deal of evaluation done while teaching concepts on both sides of the ball we have two things to focus on right now  communication and understanding our offensive and defensive structure” bollinger is key at arkansas monica bollinger summit will be a key piece to the puzzle arkansas volleyball coach robert pulliza is assembling at the southeastern conference school when pulliza was hired five years ago he brought with him a reputation as a prime recruiter and a goal of turning the razorbacks into a national contender pulliza one of a handful of coaches to have played ball state and coached wisconsin in the final four continues to move arkansas toward national prominence  and his latest recruiting class should continue to raise the bar for the razorbacks that’s where bollinger enters the equation a foot defensive specialist bollinger is at the heart of the freshman class and is termed by pulliza “a defensive player that brings great skill and a competitive edge that is unmatched” bollinger was a fouryear allsuburban south selection at summit where she finished her career with a schoolrecord  kills  digs and  service aces
