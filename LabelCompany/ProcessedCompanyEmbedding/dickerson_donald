interview will air monday on cbs this morning broadcasting live from the white house play video cbs evening news trump marks  days in office president donald trump marked his th day in office with a campaignstyle rally in pennsylvania and an interview with cbs news face the natio john dickerson mr president you and the administration said to north korea dont test a missile they have tested a missile is the pressure not working president donald trump well i didnt say dont test a missile hes going to have to do what he has to do but he understands were not going to be very happy and i will tell you a man that ive gotten to like and respect the president of china president xi i believe has been putting pressure on him also but so far perhaps nothings happened and perhaps it has this was a small missile this was not a big missile this was not a nuclear test which he was expected to do three days ago well see what happens john dickerson you say not happy what does that mean president donald trump i would not be happy if he does a nuclear test i will not be happy and i can tell you also i dont believe that the president of china who is a very respected man will be happy either john dickerson not happy mean military action president donald trump i dont know i mean well see play video face the nation trump on us response if north korea stages another nuclear test president donald trump sat down with cbs news john dickerson for an interview on his th day in office john dickerson the chinese our allies have been allies with north korea how are you sure that theyre not using this as a way to test you president donald trump you can never be sure of anything can you but i developed a very good relationship i dont think they want to see a destabilized north korea i dont think they want to see it they certainly dont want to see nuclear on  from their neighbor they havent liked it for a long time but well have to see what happens the relationship i have with china its been already acclaimed as being something very special something very different than weve ever had but again you know well find out whether or not president xi is able to affect change john dickerson why do president donald trump i hope he is john dickerson why do these missiles keep blowing up president donald trump well id rather not discuss it but perhaps theyre just not very good missiles but eventually hell have good missiles john dickerson you dont want to discuss it because maybe we have something to do with it president donald trump i just dont want to discuss it and i think you know me very well where youve asked me many times over the last couple of years about military i said we shouldnt be announcing were going into mosul i said we shouldnt be announcing all our moves it is a chess game i just dont want people to know what my thinking is so eventually he will have a better delivery system and if that happens we cant allow it to happen john dickerson what do you make of the north korean leader president donald trump i have  i really you know have no comment on him people are saying is he sane i have no idea i can tell you this and a lot of people dont like when i say it but he was a young man of  or  when he took over from his father when his father died hes dealing with obviously very tough people in particular the generals and others trump declares chance of major major conflict with n korea during interviewand at a very young age he was able to assume power a lot of people im sure tried to take that power away whether it was his uncle or anybody else and he was able to do it so obviously hes a pretty smart cookie but we have a situation that we just cannot let  we cannot let whats been going on for a long period of years continue and frankly this shouldve been done and taken care of by the obama administration shouldve been taken care of by the bush administration shouldve been taken care of by clinton play video face the nation president trump says kim jong un is a pretty smart cookie president donald trump tells cbs news john dickerson that north korean leader kim jong un was able to assume power at a very young age a lot o john dickerson let me ask you a question about the presidency george w bush said this about being president he said you think one thing going in and then the pressures of the job or the realities of the world are different than you thought do you agree president donald trump i think i can agree with that i love doing it im you know thoroughly enjoying it its always a challenge like life itself is a challenge but its something that i really love and i think ive done a very good job at it john dickerson you said in an interview with reuters that you thought it would be easier why president donald trump well its a tough job but ive had a lot of tough jobs ive had things that were tougher although ill let you know that better at the end of eight years perhaps eight years hopefully eight years but ill let you know later on i think weve done very well with foreign policy i think weve done very very well with relationships with other leaders i think were doing great on trade deals its set and i think were doing well i mean our country is being outtraded at every single point were losing tremendous amounts of money on trade and i think actually ive been very consistent you know its very funny when the fake media goes out you know which we call the mainstream media which sometimes i must say is you john dickerson you mean me personally or president donald trump well your show i love your show i call it deface the nation but you know your show is sometimes not exactly correct but when they talk about currency manipulation and i did say i would call china if they were a currency manipulator early in my tenure and then i get there number one they  as soon as i got elected they stopped theyre not  its not going down anymore their currency john dickerson but that had been true before that had been true president donald trump no john dickerson during the campaign sir president donald trump no not true to the extent that were talking about much more important than that as to when but you know it did stop and i was talking about it all during the campaign and i would say that i was the one that got them to stop but forget that john dickerson you were the one who got china president donald trump he is working with us john dickerson to stop manipulating their currency president donald trump i think so during the campaign i talked about john dickerson even if they were doing it before president donald trump no they were doing it before i mean there was no question i mean they were absolute currency manipulators before but somebody said oh you didnt call him a currency manipulator now you and i are just talking about how hes working  i believe that president xi is working to try and resolve a very big problem for china also and thats north korea can you imagine if i say hey by the way how are you doing with north korea also were going to announce that youre a currency manipulator tomorrow so the mainstream media never talks about that they never say that and thats you know unfortunate its just john dickerson let me president donald trump its just one of many things john john dickerson youre a negotiator if you need something from somebody you need china to help you with north korea doesnt that send a message to china were not going to bug you about human rights about intellectual property in the south china sea were not going to put too much heat on you arent you breaking one of your own negotiating rules president donald trump no i think that frankly north korea is maybe more important than trade trade is very important but massive warfare with millions potentially millions of people being killed that as we would say trumps trade john dickerson let me ask you president donald trump okay you understand what im saying and if i can use trade as a method to get china because i happen to think that china does have reasonably good powers over north korea now maybe not you know ultimate but pretty good powers now if china can help us with north korea and can solve that problem john dickerson let me ask president donald trump thats worth making not as good a trade deal for the united states excuse me right john dickerson what do you know now on day  that you wish you knew on day one of the presidency play video face the nation trump reflects on lessons learned in first  days of presidency president donald trump tells cbs news john dickerson one of the things that ive learned is how dishonest the media is really president donald trump well one of the things that ive learned is how dishonest the media is really ive done things that are i think very good ive set great foundations with foreign leaders we have you know  nafta as you know i was going to terminate it but i got a very nice call from a man i like the president of mexico i got a very nice call from justin trudeau the prime minister of canada and they said please would you rather than terminating nafta   i was all set to do it in fact i was going to do it today i was going to do as were sitting here i wouldve had to delay you i was going to do it today i was going to terminate nafta but they called up and they said would you negotiate and i said yes i will negotiate john dickerson thats all youve learned about the media you knew from the campaign about the media you said it all the time  president donald trump no no but the media didnt cover it that way the media said oh i didnt terminate nafta john dickerson so president donald trump first of all if you look at my statements i said john dickerson no no i meant president donald trump if im not able to renegotiate nafta i will terminate nafta well ill make that statement right now john dickerson heres a question president donald trump if im not able to renegotiate nafta we will terminate nafta john dickerson lets step back a minute president donald trump okay john dickerson presidents have to learn how to adapt every president comes into the job its different than they expect they must adapt surely youve learned something else other than that the media is dishonest president donald trump no no im just saying john dickerson and how do you adapt president donald trump it was one of my disappointments john dickerson give me another thing you learned that youre going to adapt and change because all presidents have to at this stage president donald trump well i think things generally tend to go a little bit slower than youd like them to go john dickerson why president donald trump just a system its just a very very bureaucratic system i think the rules in congress and in particular the rules in the senate are unbelievably archaic and slow moving and in many cases unfair in many cases youre forced to make deals that are not the deal youd make youd make a much different kind of a deal youre forced into situations that you hate to be forced into i also learned and this is very sad because we have a country that we have to take care of the democrats have been totally obstructionist chuck schumer has turned out to be a bad leader hes a bad leader for the country and the democrats are extremely obstructionist all they do is obstruct all they do is delay even our supreme court justice as you know who i think is going to be outstanding justice gorsuch i think that it was disgraceful the way they handled that but you know i still have people im waiting for them to be approved our chief trade negotiator we cant get these people through john dickerson i want to get to president donald trump they are obstructionists and you know what thats hurting its hurting the country john dickerson let me ask you about health care  tucker carlson interviewed you about six weeks ago when you were in the middle of health care negotiations and you agreed with him that the health care bill wasnt going to help your supporters that those who lived in rural areas the older were going to get hurt by that bill and you told him president donald trump excuse me the health care bill is going to help my supporters john dickerson well hold on let me just finish the question if i may sir president donald trump otherwise im not going to sign it im not going to do it john dickerson well this is why i wanted to ask you you said to tucker we will take care of our people or i am not signing it you said you were going to negotiate play video face the nation president trump guarantees preexisting condition coverage in new health care bill president trump says the new health care bill promises coverage for americans with preexisting conditions we have a specific clause that guara president donald trump well thats what i just said john dickerson so tell me what in the bill youve been negotiating to get president donald trump but let me john dickerson in that helps your supporters im just trying to get the details of how your people president donald trump let me just tell you john dickerson will be helped president donald trump preexisting conditions are in the bill and i just watched another network than yours and they were saying preexisting is not covered preexisting conditions are in the bill and i mandate it i said has to be john dickerson so president donald trump we have were going to have lower premiums and before you start there let me just tell you something obamacare is dead obamacare right now all the insurance companies are fleeing places like tennessee have already lost half of their state with the insurance companies theyre all going obamacare john is dead okay because were being  were being compared to obamacare just so obamacare doesnt work john dickerson i just want to compare you to your own president donald trump one thing no no its important ive got to compare it john dickerson no no but i want president donald trump but you were saying about obamacare john dickerson no but im not im asking what president donald trump with obamacare john dickerson youre going to do president donald trump the premiums are too high the deductibles are through the roof so you never get to use it but more importantly its dead john dickerson so but in the bill as it was analyzed there were two problems one and you talked about this with congressman robert aderholt who brought you the example of the yearold who under obamacare the premiums president donald trump but that was a long time ago john john dickerson but has that been fixed president donald trump totally fixed john dickerson how president donald trump how weve made many changes to the bill you know this bill is john dickerson what kind though president donald trump very much different than it was three weeks ago john dickerson help us explain because there are people president donald trump the bill john dickerson out there wondering what kind of changes president donald trump let me explain let me explain it to you john dickerson okay president donald trump this bill is much different than it was a little while ago okay this bill has evolved and we didnt have a failure on the bill you know it was reported like a failure now the one thing i wouldnt have done again is put a timeline thats why on the second iteration i didnt put a timeline but we have now preexisting conditions in the bill we have  weve set up a pool for the preexisting conditions so that the premiums can be allowed to fall were taking across all of the borders or the lines so that insurance companies can compete john dickerson but thats not in president donald trump nationwide john dickerson this bill the borders are not in president donald trump of course its in john dickerson this bill its in that third bill right because president donald trump its in the second phase john dickerson okay president donald trump its called phase one phase two and thats in effect second phase which will get approved which will quickly get approved john dickerson let me president donald trump but let me just explain something there will be such competition right now theres no competition there will be such competition by insurance companies so that they can get health care and the people taking care of health care john dickerson so president donald trump the other thing were going to have is groups groups of people can negotiate whats going to happen is the competition is going to drive down the premiums in my opinion much much more than people understand john dickerson so what youve just described is the bill that you previously had said you worried wouldnt help your people and heres why i ask you said preexisting conditions president donald trump no there were things in the other bill the first version which were not as good john dickerson okay president donald trump but when i watch some of the news reports which are so unfair and they say we dont cover preexisting conditions we cover it beautifully john dickerson although president donald trump ill tell you who doesnt cover preexisting conditions obamacare you know why its dead john dickerson in one of the fixes that was president donald trump its not going to be here john dickerson in one of the fixes it was discussed preexisting was optional for the states president donald trump sure in one of the fixes and theyre changing it john dickerson oh okay so itll president donald trump and changing john dickerson be permanent president donald trump of course john dickerson okay well thats a development sir so youre saying its going to be preexisting to everybody president donald trump john this has evolved over a period of three or four weeks now we really have a good bill i think they could have voted on friday i said just relax dont worry about this phony  day thing just relax take it easy take your time get the good vote and make it perfect john dickerson just to president donald trump most importantly were going to drive down premiums were going to drive down deductibles because right now deductibles are so high you never  unless youre going to die a long hard death you never can get to use your health care john dickerson let me ask you something president donald trump because the deductibles are so high john dickerson okay so what i hear you saying is preexisting is going to be in there for everybody its not going to be up to the states president donald trump preexisting is going to be in there and were also john dickerson and its not up to the states president donald trump going to create pools john dickerson okay president donald trump and pools are going to take care of the preexisting john dickerson but on that crucial question its not going to be left up to the states everybody gets preexisting no matter where they live president donald trump no but the states john dickerson guaranteed president donald trump are also going to have a lot to do with it because we ultimately want to get it back down to the states john dickerson okay is it a guarantee president donald trump look because if you hurt your knee honestly id rather have the federal government focused on north korea focused on other things than your knee okay or than your back as important as your back is i would much rather see the federal government focused on other things john dickerson let me president donald trump bigger things now the state is going to be in a much better position to take care because its smaller john dickerson people out there with preexisting conditions they are worried are they going to have the guarantee of coverage if they have a preexisting condition or if they live in a state where the governor decides thats not a part of the health care or that the prices are going to go up thats the worry the american medical association says president donald trump we actually john dickerson it could effectively make coverage completely unaffordable for people president donald trump we actually have well forget about unaffordable whats unaffordable is obamacare john john dickerson so im not hearing you mr president say theres a guarantee of preexisting conditions president donald trump we actually have  we actually have a clause that guarantees john dickerson okay excellent we got there president donald trump we have a specific clause john dickerson let me ask you president donald trump that guarantees john dickerson about your tax plan president donald trump go ahead john dickerson tax plan came out this week its got some big deficit numbers youve said thats going to be made up by growth congressional president donald trump well not only growth its going to be made up by better trade deals its going to be made up john dickerson let me president donald trump by many different reciprocal tax as an example we have countries where if we make a product and we send it to that country they charge us  tax if they make the same product and send it to us we charge them nothing you think thats smart its not john dickerson look president donald trump were going to come up with reciprocal taxes and lots of other things on those countries but i view that more in trade were also going to fix all of our trade deals were going to have a very wealthy country again john dickerson let me ask you this mr president congress may not go along with president donald trump always john dickerson so theyre going to try and find some spending let me ask you about the question of medicare theyre going to want in congress to make up on the spending side to change medicare will you allow that president donald trump youre not going to have to do it john dickerson but sir will you allow it president donald trump youre not going to have to do it im just telling you we are john dickerson does president donald trump want them not to do that president donald trump i would much prefer them not to do that thats right john dickerson it sounds as if having covered you in the campaign it sounds like youre leaving the door open on the campaign you were quite clear you said im the guy whos not going to touch medicare president donald trump okay then let me more clear im not going to touch it because i said it now waste fraud and abuse im going to touch if theres something in medicare thats been abused i will touch that there are certain things as you know that have been absolutely abused there are certain provisions in medicare that are horrible and abusive and theres been terrible things happening so that kind of stuff i will absolutely touch john dickerson so if i president donald trump but the concept of medicare im not touching john dickerson for me if i have it now or if im going to have it in the future its not getting cut president donald trump waste fraud and abuse john dickerson and thats it president donald trump and if there are things within medicare that are being abused i will touch that also john dickerson other than that its tightened up president donald trump thats right thats what it is but heres what we do were going to grow the numbers just came out for obamas last year  gdp that means nothing thats like  gdp so i have gotten to know as you know i really get along with a lot of other countries so i talk to the heads of countries how are you doing not well not well why gdp is  gdp is  we are doing poorly gdp  our gdp is like  john dickerson let me ask you about your tax returns sir when your treasury secretary was asked about whether you were going to release them secretary mnuchin said the president has no intention is that right play video face the nation president trump i never spoke with sec mnuchin about my tax returns in response to secretary mnuchins comment that the president has no intention of releasing tax returns president trump says the two have neve president donald trump well i never spoke to him about it honestly hes never asked me about it i said number one im under audit right now im under audit after the audit is complete its a routine audit but i have a very big tax return youve seen the pictures my tax return is probably higher than that from the floor when you look at other peoples tax return even other wealthy people their tax return is this big my tax return is this high john dickerson i just wanted to make sure president donald trump im under routine john dickerson you werent changing president donald trump audit and i think its a very unfair thing because i have been under audit almost like since i became famous okay john dickerson have you president donald trump not just political i mean i have been under audit ill bet you  or  or  years in a row now i have friends that are wealthy people john dickerson let me ask you president donald trump theyve never been audited john dickerson you president donald trump and i think its very unfair john dickerson you first said that you were under audit were going to wait till that was done about  months ago that seems like a long time when do you think this might happen are you asking them president donald trump it could happen soon i dont know i mean i think john dickerson when give me a sense of president donald trump its pretty routine to be honest with you but then ill make a decision john dickerson a member of congress suggested that a condition for getting tax reform would be releasing your tax returns what do you think about that president donald trump oh i dont know who did that i mean i dont care who did that these are the people you know the great obstructionists john dickerson so youre not buying that deal president donald trump look where they are look where the democrats have ended up hey john they had everything going now they dont have the presidency they dont have the house they dont have the senate and schumers going around making a fool out of himself john dickerson you said yesterday on fox that russia is a phony story which part of it is phony president donald trump the concept of russia with respect to us is a total phony story john dickerson meaning the trump campaign president donald trump of course its a total phony story in fact i just heard where general flynn got his clearance from the obama administration john dickerson but you dont mean president donald trump excuse me i didnt realize this when he went to russia it was  and he was on the obama clearance when general flynn came to us as you now know he already had the highest clearance you can have i think the same clearance as the president of the united states would have he had this really high clearance and by the way theyre so devastated because this only came up two days ago john dickerson let me ask you this sir president donald trump why wasnt this reported months ago john dickerson i president donald trump but i watched one of your other competitors and they were devastated john dickerson look president donald trump by this news because you know what that kills them thats the end of that subject john dickerson you dont think its phony that they the russians tried to meddle in the election you believe that president donald trump that i dont know i dont know john dickerson that you dont know or you do know president donald trump well i have a problem you have podesta who by the way i understand has a company with his brother in russia hillarys husband makes speeches in russia hillary did a uranium deal with russia nobody ever talks about that but i dont know john dickerson you dont president donald trump because the fbi was not allowed by podesta to go in and check all of the records on their servers and everything else that you would normally have to check thats number one number two knowing something about hacking if you dont catch a hacker okay in the act its very hard to say who did the hacking with that being said ill go along with russia couldve been china couldve been a lot of different groups john dickerson so president donald trump is ambivalent president donald trump but it couldve john dickerson about or not ambivalent youre not just not sure president donald trump no we have to find out what happened id love to find out what happened john dickerson but you dont think its the russians president donald trump i can tell you one thing had nothing to do with us had nothing to do with this and everyone knows it and by the way even my enemies on your show said we havent found anything that the trump campaign did wrong john dickeron but president donald trump do you agree with that john dickerson but there is agreement in the intelligence communities and other places and investigative communities on the hill that russia was president donald trump im okay with it john dickerson involved in the election president donald trump honestly john im okay but why didnt podesta and the democrats why didnt they allow the fbi to eject the server they hired some company who somebody said some pretty bad things about to go and check their server and give the information so they were hacked why didnt they  the democrats allow the fbi they told the fbi we are not going to allow you to do it why did they do that why did they do that john why wouldnt they let the fbi go in and check and by the way why didnt the fbi complain about it john dickerson mr president i think were going to have to end it there president donald trump thank you    0 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved comment share tweet stumble email john dickerson on twitter» on facebook» john dickerson is the anchor of

wideranging interview about the changes hes made to the oval office lessons hes learned the bigness of the decisions he makes and where he wants to go from here below is a full transcript of their conversationpart onejohn dickerson what about infrastructure when is that going happendonald trump were going to do infrastructure very quickly weve got the plan largely completed and well be filing over the next two or three weeks maybe sooner john dickerson you said you were disappointed in the republicans in congress why president donald trump well disappointed theyre friends of mine theyre really special people whether its freedom caucus or tuesday orthursday or lets go have a drink that group theyre great people i know them all and i can honestly say a lot of them i can honestly say i dont dislike any of them i like almost all of them a lot and you know we have some votes that have never voted positively but now were the governing party before it didnt matter they could vote no it wouldnt matter because president obama was going veto everything and they didnt have the senate now we have the senate the house and the white house but these are great people and i think youre going to see the republican party really come together john dickerson so theyre kind of learning what its like to be in charge president donald trump well theyre governing now theyve never governed you know they havent governed now theyre governing so now its just not like saying no before they could say no it didnt matter because it wasnt going to get approved anyway so what difference does it make now were governing and ill tell you what the republican party theyre great people and frankly a lot of the democrats are great they have bad leadership schumers not a leader he doesnt know how to lead i know him for a long time he has no leadership ability and hes bringing them so far left theyre never going to win another election believe me john dickerson whats the difference between negotiating in washington versus negotiating in businesspresident donald trump well i think the big difference is for what were doing here washington you really need heart because youre talking about a lot of people whereas business you dont need so much heart you want to make a good dealpart twojohn dickerson every president makes the oval office theirs what have you done to make this yours president donald trump well a lot of things we had these incredible flags including the american flags  and they were in different rooms  and they were always being pushed around because they didnt have enough room  and i said how beautiful the base the flags army navy marine corps  i mean just so beautiful  just so beautiful  the coast guard flag over here and i said well lets see how they look in the oval office so the flags were up the picture of thomas jefferson i put up the picture of andrew jackson i put up because they said his campaign and my campaign tended to mirror each other so we did a lot of actually we did a lot of work itsits a muchits a much different  look than it was previously john dickerson what would fred thats a picture of fred trump over there president donald trump thats my father john dickerson yeah president donald trump i have  one coming of my mother  a beautiful john dickerson what would he think                                 president donald trump well hed be very proud he was a brooklyn builder i learned a lot from him hes a great guy good heart tough guy but a good heart great heart and hed be very proud                                    john dickerson you said the white house was like a cocoon sometimes tell me about that                                    president donald trump well i was very well known as you understand prior to this but that was a different type of  that was a different world this is something you are really in your own little world secret service theyre phenomenal but they are all over the place i mean they are the real deal theyre all over the place if i wanted to get out drive my car to a certain location and go do something you cant do that anymore havent been able to do that for a long period of time but all of that i understand i guess i assumed that that would happen if you won and most importantly i think were doing a very good job and i enjoy it                                    john dickerson tell me about what youyou do a lot of your work in here right                                    president donald trump i do im here a lot actually                                    john dickerson why in here and not other places                                    president donald trump i feel very warm toward the oval office its a great symbol also when i have certain people that we want to negotiate for instance i was negotiating to reduce the price of the big fighter jet contract the f which was totally out of control i will save billions and billions and billions of dollars and calling from here and meeting here and having meetings on that contract i think gives you great additional power if you want to know the truth                                    john dickerson so whats your                                    president donald trump other people have come in big people from big companies have been to the white house  times in one case i wont say who somebody you know very well the head of a major major company i said have you been to the white house before yes  times i said oh good so youve been to the oval office no i was never brought to the oval office i said come on ill bring you to the oval office the person came into the oval office and started to cry this is a tough person by the way came into the oval office and started to cry now this a person with a magnificent office with beautiful glass walls and everything else you understand youve seen those offices before but there is something very special about this space                                     john dickerson if somebodys going to behave like that in front of you in here how do you know that people arent always just telling you what you want to hear                                    president donald trump you mean with the tears  is it john dickerson no just you know they see the power of the white house and the oval office and they think yes mr president who tells you no                                    president donald trump oh i think when it comes to the oval office i think everybody means that you know when i have foreign leaders here no matter what country no matter how big we had  chancellor merkel we had we have them all they all come here they still take notice at the oval office john dickerson right president donald trump and they mean it                                    john dickerson but thats what i mean one of the worries about a presidency is that everybody tells you yes nobody helps you figure out where your blind spots are so how do you  how do  president donald trump well john dickerson  you find that  how do you get                                     president donald trump thats i guess its one of those things in life you have to be able to figure it out maybe ive been figuring that out anyway long before i got here john dickerson mm hm president donald trump but some things you have to be able to figure out but this is a special place the white house is special the oval office very special                                    john dickerson any other gadgets youve gotten installed here since you came                                 president donald trump well everyone thinks that this is very ominous right here see this these are phones these are very you know secure phones but this is a  very ominous looking because of the red button john dickerson what does that get you               president donald trump well john dickerson  when you press the red button president donald trump  it gets you a coke or gets you a pepsi one or the other itd have to be any other cola companies i should mention  right  but it gets you something but every time i press that people john dickerson worry youre president donald trump in fact i have fun with people theyll be sitting down i changed the the way it works ill have people sitting here used to be they never had chairs that anybody can remember in front of the desk but ive always done it this way where im at the desk and i have people here but usually they would sit on the sofas but this is the resolute desk its a great desk with a phenomenal history many great presidents were behind this desk and then some choose other desks they have about seven desks that you can actually choose but i like this this was fdr it was ronald reagan it was kennedy and theres some great presidents behind this desk john dickerson george w bush said the reason the oval office is round is there are no corners you can hide in president donald trump well theres truth to that there is truth to that there are certainly no corners and you look theres a certain openness but theres nobody out there you know there is an openness but ive never seen anybody out there actually as you could imagine john dickerson but he what he meant was its all comes  president donald trump sure sure john dickerson back to you president donald trump sure it does but i think thats true anyway but it does theres no question john dickerson when did that hit you that youre the magnitude of that of the office and that idea that you were regardless of what happened your name the buck stopped with you president donald trump its the bigness of the office its the bigness of the transactions its the bigness of the deals you look at the order of planes its bigger than any order of planes you look at aircraft carriers that cost 0 billion and  billion dollars to build and submarines that cost  billion to build its the magnitude but most importantly you know the decisions like when i make the decision to go with syria the  tomahawk missiles unbelievable technology we have unbelievable talent but those are tough decisions those arent like decisions that im going to buy a building                                    john dickerson tough why                                    president donald trump because its human lives                                    john dickerson killing people                                    president donald trump youre killing people and you can kill the wrong people too you know those things go off and they end up in a town or they end up in a city and you have another tragedy on your hands so these decisions are unbelievable  you know in terms of the importance because its human itsitsits killing i hate it but things have to be done                                    john dickerson how do you learn that skill who do you call to say whats it like to                                     president donald trump theres nobody you can call                                    john dickerson did president obama give you any advice that was helpful that you think wow he really was                                      donald trump   well he was very nice to me but after that weve had some difficulties so it doesnt matter you know words are less important to me than deeds and you you saw what happened with surveillance and everybody saw what happened with surveillance                                    john dickerson difficulties how                                    president donald trump  and i thought that  well you saw what happened with surveillance and i think that was inappropriate but thats the way                                    john dickerson what does that mean sir                                    president donald trump you can figure that out yourself                                    john dickerson well i the reason i ask is you said he was you called him sick and bad                                     president donald trump look you can figure it out yourself he was very nice to me with words but and when i was with him  but after that there has been no relationship                                    john dickerson but you stand by that claim about him                                    president donald trump i dont stand by anything i just you can take it the way you want i think our sides been proven very strongly and everybodys talking about it and frankly it should be discussed i think that is a very big surveillance of our citizens i think its a very big topic and its a topic that should be number one and we should find out what the hell is going on                                    john dickerson i just wanted to find out though youre youre the president of the united states you said he was sick and bad because he had tapped you im just                                     president donald trump you can take any way you can take it any way you want                                     john dickerson but im asking you because you dont want it to be                                     president donald trump you dont john dickerson fake news i want to hear it from                                    president donald trump you dont have to                                    john dickerson president trump                                     president donald trump ask me  you dont have to ask me                                    john dickerson why not                                    president donald trump because i have my own opinions you can have your own opinions

trump spoke to cbs news chief washington correspondent and host of face the nation john dickerson about his accomplishments at the traditional milestone and beyond before flying to harrisburg pennsylvania to give a speech at a rally    what follows is a full transcript of the interview which aired on cbs earlier sunday additional coverage of the interview will air monday on cbs this morning broadcasting live from the white housejohn dickerson mr president you and the administration said to north korea dont test a missile they have tested a missile is the pressure not workingpresident donald trump well i didnt say dont test a missile hes going to have to do what he has to do but he understands were not going to be very happy and i will tell you a man that ive gotten to like and respect the president of china president xi i believe has been putting pressure on him also but so far perhaps nothings happened and perhaps it has this was a small missile this was not a big missile this was not a nuclear test which he was expected to do three days ago well see what happensjohn dickerson you say not happy what does that meanpresident donald trump i would not be happy if he does a nuclear test i will not be happy and i can tell you also i dont believe that the president of china who is a very respected man will be happy eitherjohn dickerson not happy mean military actionpresident donald trump i dont know i mean well seejohn dickerson the chinese our allies have been allies with north korea how are you sure that theyre not using this as a way to test youpresident donald trump you can never be sure of anything can you but i developed a very good relationship i dont think they want to see a destabilized north korea i dont think they want to see it they certainly dont want to see nuclear on  from their neighbor they havent liked it for a long time but well have to see what happensthe relationship i have with china its been already acclaimed as being something very special something very different than weve ever had but again you know well find out whether or not president xi is able to affect changejohn dickerson why dopresident donald trump i hope he isjohn dickerson why do these missiles keep blowing uppresident donald trump well id rather not discuss it but perhaps theyre just not very good missiles but eventually hell have good missilesjohn dickerson you dont want to discuss it because maybe we have something to do with itpresident donald trump i just dont want to discuss it and i think you know me very well where youve asked me many times over the last couple of years about military i said we shouldnt be announcing were going into mosul i said we shouldnt be announcing all our moves it is a chess game i just dont want people to know what my thinking is so eventually he will have a better delivery system and if that happens we cant allow it to happenjohn dickerson what do you make of the north korean leaderpresident donald trump i have  i really you know have no comment on him people are saying is he sane i have no idea i can tell you this and a lot of people dont like when i say it but he was a young man of  or  when he took over from his father when his father died hes dealing with obviously very tough people in particular the generals and othersand at a very young age he was able to assume power a lot of people im sure tried to take that power away whether it was his uncle or anybody else and he was able to do it so obviously hes a pretty smart cookie but we have a situation that we just cannot let  we cannot let whats been going on for a long period of years continue and frankly this shouldve been done and taken care of by the obama administration shouldve been taken care of by the bush administration shouldve been taken care of by clintonjohn dickerson let me ask you a question about the presidency george w bush said this about being president he said you think one thing going in and then the pressures of the job or the realities of the world are different than you thought do you agreepresident donald trump i think i can agree with that i love doing it im you know thoroughly enjoying it its always a challenge like life itself is a challenge but its something that i really love and i think ive done a very good job at itjohn dickerson you said in an interview with reuters that you thought it would be easier whypresident donald trump well its a tough job but ive had a lot of tough jobs ive had things that were tougher although ill let you know that better at the end of eight years perhaps eight years hopefully eight years but ill let you know later on i think weve done very well with foreign policy i think weve done very very well with relationships with other leadersi think were doing great on trade deals its set and i think were doing well i mean our country is being outtraded at every single point were losing tremendous amounts of money on trade and i think actually ive been very consistent you know its very funny when the fake media goes out you know which we call the mainstream media which sometimes i must say is youjohn dickerson you mean me personally orpresident donald trump well your show i love your show i call it deface the nation but you know your show is sometimes not exactly correct but when they talk about currency manipulation and i did say i would call china if they were a currency manipulator early in my tenure and then i get there number one they  as soon as i got elected they stopped theyre not  its not going down anymore their currencyjohn dickerson but that had been true before that had been truepresident donald trump nojohn dickerson during the campaign sirpresident donald trump no not true to the extent that were talking about much more important than that as to when but you know it did stop and i was talking about it all during the campaign and i would say that i was the one that got them to stop but forget thatjohn dickerson you were the one who got chinapresident donald trump he is working with usjohn dickerson to stop manipulating their currencypresident donald trump i think so during the campaign i talked aboutjohn dickerson even if they were doing it beforepresident donald trump no they were doing it before i mean there was no question i mean they were absolute currency manipulators before but somebody said oh you didnt call him a currency manipulator now you and i are just talking about how hes working  i believe that president xi is working to try and resolve a very big problem for china alsoand thats north korea can you imagine if i say hey by the way how are you doing with north korea also were going to announce that youre a currency manipulator tomorrow so the mainstream media never talks about that they never say that and thats you know unfortunate its justjohn dickerson let mepresident donald trump its just one of many things johnjohn dickerson youre a negotiator if you need something from somebody you need china to help you with north korea doesnt that send a message to china were not going to bug you about human rights about intellectual property in the south china sea were not going to put too much heat on you arent you breaking one of your own negotiating rulespresident donald trump no i think that frankly north korea is maybe more important than trade trade is very important but massive warfare with millions potentially millions of people being killed that as we would say trumps tradejohn dickerson let me ask youpresident donald trump okay you understand what im saying and if i can use trade as a method to get china because i happen to think that china does have reasonably good powers over north korea now maybe not you know ultimate but pretty good powers now if china can help us with north korea and can solve that problemjohn dickerson let me askpresident donald trump thats worth making not as good a trade deal for the united states excuse me rightjohn dickerson what do you know now on day  that you wish you knew on day one of the presidencypresident donald trump well one of the things that ive learned is how dishonest the media is really ive done things that are i think very good ive set great foundations with foreign leaders we have you know  nafta as you know i was going to terminate it but i got a very nice call from a man i like the president of mexicoi got a very nice call from justin trudeau the prime minister of canada and they said please would you rather than terminating nafta   i was all set to do it in fact i was going to do it today i was going to do as were sitting here i wouldve had to delay you i was going to do it today i was going to terminate nafta but they called up and they said would you negotiate and i said yes i will negotiatejohn dickerson thats all youve learned about the media you knew from the campaign about the media you said it all the time president donald trump no no but the media didnt cover it that way the media said oh i didnt terminate naftajohn dickerson sopresident donald trump first of all if you look at my statements i saidjohn dickerson no no i meantpresident donald trump if im not able to renegotiate nafta i will terminate nafta well ill make that statement right nowjohn dickerson heres a questionpresident donald trump if im not able to renegotiate nafta we will terminate naftajohn dickerson lets step back a minutepresident donald trump okayjohn dickerson presidents have to learn how to adapt every president comes into the job its different than they expect they must adapt surely youve learned something else other than that the media is dishonestpresident donald trump no no im just sayingjohn dickerson and how do you adaptpresident donald trump it was one of my disappointmentsjohn dickerson give me another thing you learned that youre going to adapt and change because all presidents have to at this stagepresident donald trump well i think things generally tend to go a little bit slower than youd like them to gojohn dickerson whypresident donald trump just a system its just a very very bureaucratic system i think the rules in congress and in particular the rules in the senate are unbelievably archaic and slow moving and in many cases unfair in many cases youre forced to make deals that are not the deal youd make youd make a much different kind of a dealyoure forced into situations that you hate to be forced into i also learned and this is very sad because we have a country that we have to take care of the democrats have been totally obstructionist chuck schumer has turned out to be a bad leader hes a bad leader for the country and the democrats are extremely obstructionistall they do is obstruct all they do is delay even our supreme court justice as you know who i think is going to be outstanding justice gorsuch i think that it was disgraceful the way they handled that but you know i still have people im waiting for them to be approved our chief trade negotiator we cant get these people throughjohn dickerson i want to get topresident donald trump they are obstructionists and you know what thats hurting its hurting the countryjohn dickerson let me ask you about health care  tucker carlson interviewed you about six weeks ago when you were in the middle of health care negotiations and you agreed with him that the health care bill wasnt going to help your supporters that those who lived in rural areas the older were going to get hurt by that bill and you told himpresident donald trump excuse me the health care bill is going to help my supportersjohn dickerson well hold on let me just finish the question if i may sirpresident donald trump otherwise im not going to sign it im not going to do itjohn dickerson well this is why i wanted to ask you you said to tucker we will take care of our people or i am not signing it you said you were going to negotiatepresident donald trump well thats what i just saidjohn dickerson so tell me what in the bill youve been negotiating to getpresident donald trump but let mejohn dickerson in that helps your supporters im just trying to get the details of how your peoplepresident donald trump let me just tell youjohn dickerson will be helpedpresident donald trump preexisting conditions are in the bill and i just watched another network than yours and they were saying preexisting is not covered preexisting conditions are in the bill and i mandate it i said has to bejohn dickerson sopresident donald trump we have were going to have lower premiums and before you start there let me just tell you something obamacare is dead obamacare right now all the insurance companies are fleeing places like tennessee have already lost half of their state with the insurance companies theyre all going obamacare john is dead okay because were being  were being compared to obamacare just so obamacare doesnt workjohn dickerson i just want to compare you to your ownpresident donald trump one thing no no its important ive got to compare itjohn dickerson no no but i wantpresident donald trump but you were saying about obamacarejohn dickerson no but im not im asking whatpresident donald trump with obamacarejohn dickerson youre going to dopresident donald trump the premiums are too high the deductibles are through the roof so you never get to use it but more importantly its deadjohn dickerson so but in the bill as it was analyzed there were two problems one and you talked about this with congressman robert aderholt who brought you the example of the yearold who under obamacare the premiumspresident donald trump but that was a long time ago johnjohn dickerson but has that been fixedpresident donald trump totally fixedjohn dickerson howpresident donald trump how weve made many changes to the bill you know this bill isjohn dickerson what kind thoughpresident donald trump very much different than it was three weeks agojohn dickerson help us explain because there are peoplepresident donald trump the billjohn dickerson out there wondering what kind of changespresident donald trump let me explain let me explain it to youjohn dickerson okaypresident donald trump this bill is much different than it was a little while ago okay this bill has evolved and we didnt have a failure on the bill you know it was reported like a failure now the one thing i wouldnt have done again is put a timeline thats why on the second iteration i didnt put a timelinebut we have now preexisting conditions in the bill we have  weve set up a pool for the preexisting conditions so that the premiums can be allowed to fall were taking across all of the borders or the lines so that insurance companies can competejohn dickerson but thats not inpresident donald trump nationwidejohn dickerson this bill the borders are not inpresident donald trump of course its injohn dickerson this bill its in that third bill right becausepresident donald trump its in the second phasejohn dickerson okaypresident donald trump its called phase one phase two and thats in effect second phase which will get approved which will quickly get approvedjohn dickerson let mepresident donald trump but let me just explain something there will be such competition right now theres no competition there will be such competition by insurance companies so that they can get health care and the people taking care of health carejohn dickerson sopresident donald trump the other thing were going to have is groups groups of people can negotiate whats going to happen is the competition is going to drive down the premiums in my opinion much much more than people understandjohn dickerson so what youve just described is the bill that you previously had said you worried wouldnt help your people and heres why i ask you said preexisting conditionspresident donald trump no there were things in the other bill the first version which were not as goodjohn dickerson okaypresident donald trump but when i watch some of the news reports which are so unfair and they say we dont cover preexisting conditions we cover it beautifullyjohn dickerson althoughpresident donald trump ill tell you who doesnt cover preexisting conditions obamacare you know why its deadjohn dickerson in one of the fixes that waspresident donald trump its not going to be herejohn dickerson in one of the fixes it was discussed preexisting was optional for the statespresident donald trump sure in one of the fixes and theyre changing itjohn dickerson oh okay so itllpresident donald trump and changingjohn dickerson be permanentpresident donald trump of coursejohn dickerson okay well thats a development sir so youre saying its going to be preexisting to everybodypresident donald trump john this has evolved over a period of three or four weeks now we really have a good bill i think they could have voted on friday i said just relax dont worry about this phony  day thing just relax take it easy take your time get the good vote and make it perfectjohn dickerson just topresident donald trump most importantly were going to drive down premiums were going to drive down deductibles because right now deductibles are so high you never  unless youre going to die a long hard death you never can get to use your health carejohn dickerson let me ask you somethingpresident donald trump because the deductibles are so highjohn dickerson okay so what i hear you saying is preexisting is going to be in there for everybody its not going to be up to the statespresident donald trump preexisting is going to be in there and were alsojohn dickerson and its not up to the statespresident donald trump going to create poolsjohn dickerson okaypresident donald trump and pools are going to take care of the preexistingjohn dickerson but on that crucial question its not going to be left up to the states everybody gets preexisting no matter where they livepresident donald trump no but the statesjohn dickerson guaranteedpresident donald trump are also going to have a lot to do with it because we ultimately want to get it back down to the statesjohn dickerson okay is it a guaranteepresident donald trump look because if you hurt your knee honestly id rather have the federal government focused on north korea focused on other things than your knee okay or than your back as important as your back is i would much rather see the federal government focused on other thingsjohn dickerson let mepresident donald trump bigger things now the state is going to be in a much better position to take care because its smallerjohn dickerson people out there with preexisting conditions they are worried are they going to have the guarantee of coverage if they have a preexisting condition or if they live in a state where the governor decides thats not a part of the health care or that the prices are going to go up thats the worry the american medical association sayspresident donald trump we actuallyjohn dickerson it could effectively make coverage completely unaffordable for peoplepresident donald trump we actually have well forget about unaffordable whats unaffordable is obamacare johnjohn dickerson so im not hearing you mr president say theres a guarantee of preexisting conditionspresident donald trump we actually have  we actually have a clause that guaranteesjohn dickerson okay excellent we got therepresident donald trump we have a specific clausejohn dickerson let me ask youpresident donald trump that guaranteesjohn dickerson about your tax planpresident donald trump go aheadjohn dickerson tax plan came out this week its got some big deficit numbers youve said thats going to be made up by growth congressionalpresident donald trump well not only growth its going to be made up by better trade deals its going to be made upjohn dickerson let mepresident donald trump by many different reciprocal tax as an example we have countries where if we make a product and we send it to that country they charge us  tax if they make the same product and send it to us we charge them nothing you think thats smart its notjohn dickerson lookpresident donald trump were going to come up with reciprocal taxes and lots of other things on those countries but i view that more in trade were also going to fix all of our trade deals were going to have a very wealthy country againjohn dickerson let me ask you this mr president congress may not go along withpresident donald trump alwaysjohn dickerson so theyre going to try and find some spending let me ask you about the question of medicare theyre going to want in congress to make up on the spending side to change medicare will you allow thatpresident donald trump youre not going to have to do itjohn dickerson but sir will you allow itpresident donald trump youre not going to have to do it im just telling you we arejohn dickerson does president donald trump want them not to do thatpresident donald trump i would much prefer them not to do that thats rightjohn dickerson it sounds as if having covered you in the campaign it sounds like youre leaving the door open on the campaign you were quite clear you said im the guy whos not going to touch medicarepresident donald trump okay then let me more clear im not going to touch it because i said it now waste fraud and abuse im going to touch if theres something in medicare thats been abused i will touch that there are certain things as you know that have been absolutely abused there are certain provisions in medicare that are horrible and abusive and theres been terrible things happening so that kind of stuff i will absolutely touchjohn dickerson so if ipresident donald trump but the concept of medicare im not touchingjohn dickerson for me if i have it now or if im going to have it in the future its not getting cutpresident donald trump waste fraud and abusejohn dickerson and thats itpresident donald trump and if there are things within medicare that are being abused i will touch that alsojohn dickerson other than that its tightened uppresident donald trump thats right thats what it is but heres what we do were going to grow the numbers just came out for obamas last year  gdp that means nothing thats like  gdp so i have gotten to know as you know i really get along with a lot of other countries so i talk to the heads of countries how are you doing not well not well why gdp is  gdp is  we are doing poorly gdp  our gdp is like john dickerson let me ask you about your tax returns sir when your treasury secretary was asked about whether you were going to release them secretary mnuchin said the president has no intention is that rightpresident donald trump well i never spoke to him about it honestly hes never asked me about it i said number one im under audit right now im under audit after the audit is complete its a routine audit but i have a very big tax return youve seen the pictures my tax return is probably higher than that from the floor when you look at other peoples tax return even other wealthy people their tax return is this big my tax return is this highjohn dickerson i just wanted to make surepresident donald trump im under routinejohn dickerson you werent changingpresident donald trump audit and i think its a very unfair thing because i have been under audit almost like since i became famous okayjohn dickerson have youpresident donald trump not just political i mean i have been under audit ill bet you  or  or  years in a row now i have friends that are wealthy peoplejohn dickerson let me ask youpresident donald trump theyve never been auditedjohn dickerson youpresident donald trump and i think its very unfairjohn dickerson you first said that you were under audit were going to wait till that was done about  months ago that seems like a long time when do you think this might happen are you asking thempresident donald trump it could happen soon i dont know i mean i thinkjohn dickerson when give me a sense ofpresident donald trump its pretty routine to be honest with you but then ill make a decisionjohn dickerson a member of congress suggested that a condition for getting tax reform would be releasing your tax returns what do you think about thatpresident donald trump oh i dont know who did that i mean i dont care who did that these are the people you know the great obstructionistsjohn dickerson so youre not buying that dealpresident donald trump look where they are look where the democrats have ended up hey john they had everything going now they dont have the presidency they dont have the house they dont have the senate and schumers going around making a fool out of himselfjohn dickerson you said yesterday on fox that russia is a phony story which part of it is phonypresident donald trump the concept of russia with respect to us is a total phony storyjohn dickerson meaning the trump campaignpresident donald trump of course its a total phony story in fact i just heard where general flynn got his clearance from the obama administrationjohn dickerson but you dont meanpresident donald trump excuse me i didnt realize this when he went to russia it was  and he was on the obama clearance when general flynn came to us as you now know he already had the highest clearance you can have i think the same clearance as the president of the united states would have he had this really high clearance and by the way theyre so devastated because this only came up two days agojohn dickerson let me ask you this sirpresident donald trump why wasnt this reported months agojohn dickerson ipresident donald trump but i watched one of your other competitors and they were devastatedjohn dickerson lookpresident donald trump by this news because you know what that kills them thats the end of that subjectjohn dickerson you dont think its phony that they the russians tried to meddle in the election you believe thatpresident donald trump that i dont know i dont knowjohn dickerson that you dont know or you do knowpresident donald trump well i have a problem you have podesta who by the way i understand has a company with his brother in russia hillarys husband makes speeches in russia hillary did a uranium deal with russia nobody ever talks about that but i dont knowjohn dickerson you dontpresident donald trump because the fbi was not allowed by podesta to go in and check all of the records on their servers and everything else that you would normally have to check thats number onenumber two knowing something about hacking if you dont catch a hacker okay in the act its very hard to say who did the hacking with that being said ill go along with russia couldve been china couldve been a lot of different groupsjohn dickerson so president donald trump is ambivalentpresident donald trump but it couldvejohn dickerson about or not ambivalent youre not just not surepresident donald trump no we have to find out what happened id love to find out what happenedjohn dickerson but you dont think its the russianspresident donald trump i can tell you one thing had nothing to do with us had nothing to do with this and everyone knows it and by the way even my enemies on your show said we havent found anything that the trump campaign did wrongjohn dickeron butpresident donald trump do you agree with thatjohn dickerson but there is agreement in the intelligence communities and other places and investigative communities on the hill that russia waspresident donald trump im okay with itjohn dickerson involved in the electionpresident donald trump honestly john im okay but why didnt podesta and the democrats why didnt they allow the fbi to eject the server they hired some company who somebody said some pretty bad things about to go and check their server and give the information so they were hacked why didnt they  the democrats allow the fbi they told the fbi we are not going to allow you to do it why did they do that why did they do that john why wouldnt they let the fbi go in and check and by the way why didnt the fbi complain about itjohn dickerson mr president i think were going to have to end it therepresident donald trump thank you more stories two people suffer life threatening injuries in motorcycle crash a report from the outagamie county sheriffs department
