status of all active calpers private equity commitments it doesnt include any exited partnership investments the fund column lists the names of all active partnership investments vintage year is the year in which calpers’ first cash flow for the investment occurred capital committed identifies the original amount calpers committed to each fund cash in represents capital contributed for investments and management fees cash out represents distributions calpers has received back from the fund cash out  remaining value represents the distributions calpers has received plus the reported value of the invested capital net irr is the net internal rate of return based on calpers’ actual cash flows and the reported value of the invested capital investment multiple is the cash out  remaining value divided by the cash in in evaluating private equity performance calpers emphasizes using both the realized internal rate of return irr and investment multiple interim irrs by
