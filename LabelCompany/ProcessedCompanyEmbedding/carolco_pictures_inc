thenunheardof – million for his work on recall and t stallone also had similar treatment losses of partnerships also threatened the studios stability and sent it teetering towards bankruptcy in  carolco went under a corporate restructuring invested by a partnership of rizzolicorriere della sera of italy le studio canal of france pioneer electric corporation of japan and mgm each partner helped infuse up to  million into the studios stock and another  million for cofinancing deals mgm also agreed to distribute carolco product domestically after a previous deal with tristar expired in

green and with paul verhoeven attached as director in  when the budget exceeded  million however carolco was able to complete a merger with the vista organization in late october  carolco attempted a comeback with the bigbudget swashbuckler cutthroat island with michael douglas in the lead douglas dropped out early in its production and was replaced by the lessbankable matthew modine geena davis cast as the female lead through her ties with thenhusband the director renny harlin was already an established alister but was coming off of a string of flops mgm hoped to advertise cutthroat island based on spectacle rather than cast in an attempt to raise more financing for the projected – million film carolco sold off the rights to several films in production including stargate and showgirls in november  carolco filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection cutthroat island was released that christmas and became a boxoffice disaster carolco agreed to sell its assets to th century fox for  million but when canal made a  million bid for the library in january  fox which by then lowered their purchase price to  million dropped their deal out of the ashes rose a new partnership between

the john huston film escape to victory  the risk paid off after first blood made  million worldwide and placed carolco among the major players in hollywood the sequel rambo first blood part ii  was timed for the th anniversary of the united states bailout from vietnam that event garnered publicity for the new film which also became a hit the release of the two rambo films were so instrumental to carolcos financial success that the studio focused more on bigbudget action films with major stars such as stallone who later signed a tenpicture deal with the studio and arnold schwarzenegger attached these films aimed at appealing to a worldwide audience were financed using a strategy known as presales in which domestic and foreign distributors invested in these marketable films in exchange for local releasing rights also in  carolco began a distribution deal with thenfledgling studio tristar pictures with the film rambo first blood part ii tristar released the majority of carolcos films from that point on in the us and some other countries until  carolco entered home video distribution as well independent video distributor international video entertainment ive was going through financial difficulties and was near bankruptcy in  carolco purchased ive in the hopes of turning the company around the deal was finalized a year later ive merged with another distributor lieberman and became live entertainment in  on august   carolco acquired television syndicator orbis communications for  million and initiated television production and distribution they also purchased the former de laurentiis entertainment group production facility in wilmington north carolina and established carolco home video with live entertainment as output partner jose menendez was a member of the board of directors of carolco until august  when he and his wife were murdered by their sons lyle and erik menendez vajna sold his share of carolco in  due to increasing differences between kassar over the direction of the company that november vajna formed cinergi pictures with the walt disney company as a distribution partner – in  carolco acquired the rights to the terminator franchise from hemdale film corporation the company rehired terminator director james cameron who had worked as a screenwriter on rambo and arnold schwarzenegger to star in a multimilliondollar budgeted sequel terminator  judgment day  it was the highestgrossing film of the year and the most successful film in carolcos history halfway through the year carolco entered into a joint venture with new line cinema to start seven arts a distribution company which primarily released much of carolcos lowbudget output carolco struggled for some years to secure the rights to spiderman a property that cameron was keen to produce as a film plans fell through although it would eventually be made as a sam raimi film for columbia pictures toward the end of shooting true lies variety carried the announcement that carolco had received a completed screenplay from cameron this script bore the names of cameron john brancato ted newsom barry sic cohen and joseph goldmari a typographical scrambling of menahem golans pen name joseph goldman with marvel executive joseph calimari golan had previously and unsuccessfully tried to produce a spiderman film for his own studio cannon films the scripts text was identical to what golan had submitted to columbia the previous year with the addition of a new  date cameron stalwart arnold schwarzenegger was frequently linked to the project as the directors choice for dr octopus as late as  internet industry sources such as baseline hollywood still listed both neil ruttenberg author of one of the  doc ock variations submitted to columbia and cameron as cowriters carolco also attempted to make bartholomew vs neff a comedy film that was to have been written and directed by john hughes and would have starred sylvester stallone and john candy decline and collapse though carolco made several successful films through the s including total recall terminator  judgment day t and basic instinct the studio was gradually losing money as the years went on carolco mixed blockbusters with smallbudget arthouse films which were not profitable in addition the studio was criticized for overspending on films through reliance on star power and farfetched deals schwarzenegger received thenunheardof – million for his work on recall and t stallone also had similar treatment losses of partnerships also threatened the studios stability and sent it teetering towards bankruptcy in  carolco went under a corporate restructuring invested by a partnership of rizzolicorriere della sera of italy le studio canal of france pioneer electric corporation of japan and mgm each partner helped infuse up to  million into the studios stock and another  million for cofinancing deals mgm also agreed to distribute carolco product domestically after a previous deal with tristar expired in  carolco was forced to sell its shares in live entertainment to a group of investors led by pioneer it was later renamed artisan entertainment which was bought by lions gate entertainment cutbacks at carolco also forced the studio to make a deal with tristar over the funding of the stallone action film cliffhanger carolco would have to sell full distribution rights in north america mexico australia new zealand germany and france to tristar in exchange for half of the films budget although a major boxoffice success carolco saw little revenue from cliffhanger since it ended up becoming a minority owner in the film carolcos attempt to make more of its specialties proved to be more strenuous the studio had to shelve crusade an upcoming schwarzenegger vehicle based on a script by walon green and with paul verhoeven attached as director in  when the budget exceeded  million however carolco was able to complete a merger with the vista organization in late october  carolco attempted a comeback with the bigbudget swashbuckler cutthroat island with michael douglas in the lead douglas dropped out early in its production and was replaced by the lessbankable matthew modine geena davis cast as the female lead through her ties with thenhusband the director renny harlin was already an established alister but was coming off of a string of flops mgm hoped to advertise cutthroat island based on spectacle rather than cast in an attempt to raise more financing for the projected – million film carolco sold off the rights to several films in production including stargate and showgirls in november  carolco filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection cutthroat island was released that christmas and became a boxoffice disaster carolco agreed to sell its assets to th century fox for  million but when canal made a  million bid for the library in january  fox which by then lowered their purchase price to  million dropped their deal out of the ashes rose a new partnership between carolcos owner mario kassar and cinergis owner andrew g vajna in  the duo formed c pictures and produced terminator  rise of the machines and basic instinct  among other films  resurrection of carolco brand film producer alex bafer purchased the carolco name and logo years later on january   bafer renamed his production company carolco pictures formerly known as brick top productions bafer then recruited mario kassar as the chief development executive of the new carolco however on april   it was announced that both bafer and kassar had left the company kassar taking with him one of carolcos planned projects a remake of the  japanese horror film audition which he was producing investor tarek kirschen was then inducted as carolcos ceo carolcos library today after its bankruptcy the assets of carolco were later sold off to other companies most already sold during carolcos existence in march  canal purchased the library in bankruptcy court for a value of approximately  million today the ancillary rights to carolcos library up to  are held by french production company studiocanal since its parent company canal group owned a stake in carolco eventually buying out its partners on september   multimedia entertainment acquired selected assets of carolcos television distribution unit orbis communications

library today  filmography  s  s  s  references  citations  further reading  external links history early years the company was founded through the partnership of two film investors mario kassar and andrew vajna the two were hailed by newsweek as some of the most successful independent producers by the age of  vajna went from wigmaker to the owner of two hong kong theaters then vajna ventured into the production and distribution of feature films one of vajnas early productions was a  martialarts film entitled the deadly china doll which made  million worldwide from a  budget vajna was already a film sales agent in the middle east by the time he turned  their goal was to focus on film sales eventually it went into financing lowbudget films their earliest films were produced by american international pictures and itc entertainment with carolcos financial support and coproduced with canadian theater magnate garth drabinsky the name carolco was purchased from a defunct company based in panama and according to kassar it has no meaning rise carolcos first major success was first blood  an adaptation of david morrells novel kassar and vajna took a great risk buying the film rights to the novel for  and used the help of european bank loans to cast sylvester stallone as the lead character vietnam war veteran john rambo after having worked with him on the john huston film escape to victory  the risk paid off after first blood made  million worldwide and placed carolco among the major players in hollywood the sequel rambo first blood part ii  was timed for the th anniversary of the united states bailout from vietnam that event garnered publicity for the new film which also became a hit the release of the two rambo films were so instrumental to carolcos financial success that the studio focused more on bigbudget action films with major stars such as stallone who later signed a tenpicture deal with the studio and arnold schwarzenegger attached these films aimed at appealing to a worldwide audience were financed using a strategy known as presales in which domestic and foreign distributors invested in these marketable films in exchange for local releasing rights also in  carolco began a distribution deal with thenfledgling studio tristar pictures with the film rambo first blood part ii tristar released the majority of carolcos films from that point on in the us and some other countries until  carolco entered home video distribution as well independent video distributor international video entertainment ive was going through financial difficulties and was near bankruptcy in  carolco purchased ive in the hopes of turning the company around the deal was finalized a year later ive merged with another distributor lieberman and became live entertainment in  on august   carolco acquired television syndicator orbis communications for  million and initiated television production and distribution they also purchased the former de laurentiis entertainment group production facility in wilmington north carolina and established carolco home video with live entertainment as output partner jose menendez was a member of the board of directors of carolco until august  when he and his wife were murdered by their sons lyle and erik menendez vajna sold his share of carolco in  due to increasing differences between kassar over the direction of the company that november vajna formed cinergi pictures with the walt disney company as a distribution partner – in  carolco acquired the rights to the terminator franchise from hemdale film corporation the company rehired terminator director james cameron who had worked as a screenwriter on rambo and arnold schwarzenegger to star in a multimilliondollar budgeted sequel terminator  judgment day  it was the highestgrossing film of the year and the most successful film in carolcos history halfway through the year carolco entered into a joint venture with new line cinema to start seven arts a distribution company which primarily released much of carolcos lowbudget output carolco struggled for some years to secure the rights to spiderman a property that cameron was keen to produce as a film plans fell through although it would eventually be made as a sam raimi film for columbia pictures toward the end of shooting true lies variety carried the announcement that carolco had received a completed screenplay from cameron this script bore the names of cameron john brancato ted newsom barry sic cohen and joseph goldmari a typographical scrambling of menahem golans pen name joseph goldman with marvel executive joseph calimari golan had previously and unsuccessfully tried to produce a spiderman film for his own studio cannon films the scripts text was identical to what golan had submitted to columbia the previous year with the addition of a new  date cameron stalwart arnold schwarzenegger was frequently linked to the project as the directors choice for dr octopus as late as  internet industry sources such as baseline hollywood still listed both neil ruttenberg author of one of the  doc ock variations submitted to columbia and cameron as cowriters carolco also attempted to make bartholomew vs neff a comedy film that was to have been written and directed by john hughes and would have starred sylvester stallone and john candy decline and collapse though carolco made several successful films through the s including total recall terminator  judgment day t and basic instinct the studio was gradually losing money as the years went on carolco mixed blockbusters with smallbudget arthouse films which were not profitable in addition the studio was criticized for overspending on films through reliance on star power and farfetched deals schwarzenegger received thenunheardof – million for his work on recall and t stallone also had similar treatment losses of partnerships also threatened the studios stability and sent it teetering towards bankruptcy in  carolco went under a corporate restructuring invested by a partnership of rizzolicorriere della sera of italy le studio canal of france pioneer electric corporation of japan and mgm each partner helped infuse up to  million into the studios stock and another  million for cofinancing deals mgm also agreed to distribute carolco product domestically after a previous deal with tristar expired in  carolco was forced to sell its shares in live entertainment to a group of investors led by pioneer it was later renamed artisan entertainment which was bought by lions gate entertainment cutbacks at carolco also forced the studio to make a deal with tristar over the funding of the stallone action film cliffhanger carolco would have to sell full distribution rights in north america mexico australia new zealand germany and france to tristar in exchange for half of the films budget although a major boxoffice success carolco saw little revenue from cliffhanger since it ended up becoming a minority owner in the film carolcos attempt to make more of its specialties proved to be more strenuous the studio had to shelve crusade an upcoming schwarzenegger vehicle based on a script by walon green and with paul verhoeven attached as director in  when the budget exceeded  million however carolco was able to complete a merger with the vista organization in late october  carolco attempted a comeback with the bigbudget swashbuckler cutthroat island with michael douglas in the lead douglas dropped out early in its production and was replaced by the lessbankable matthew modine geena davis cast as the female lead through her ties with thenhusband the director renny harlin was already an established alister but was coming off of a string of flops mgm hoped to advertise cutthroat island based on spectacle rather than cast in an attempt to raise more financing for the projected – million film carolco sold off the rights to several films in production including stargate and showgirls in november  carolco filed for chapter  bankruptcy protection cutthroat island was released that christmas and became a boxoffice disaster carolco agreed to sell its assets to th century fox for  million but when canal made a  million bid for the library in january  fox which by then lowered their purchase price to  million dropped their deal out of the ashes rose a new partnership between carolcos owner mario kassar and cinergis owner andrew g vajna in  the duo formed c pictures and produced terminator  rise of the machines and basic instinct  among other films  resurrection of carolco brand film producer alex bafer purchased the carolco name and logo years later on january   bafer renamed his production company carolco pictures formerly known as brick top productions bafer then recruited mario kassar as the chief development executive of the new carolco however on april   it was announced that both bafer and kassar had left the company kassar taking with him one of carolcos planned projects a remake of the  japanese horror film audition which he was producing investor tarek kirschen was then inducted as carolcos ceo carolcos library today after its bankruptcy the assets of carolco were later sold off to other companies most already sold during carolcos existence in march  canal purchased the library in bankruptcy court for a value of approximately  million today the ancillary rights to carolcos library up to  are held by french production company studiocanal since its parent company canal group owned a stake in carolco eventually buying out its partners on september   multimedia entertainment acquired selected assets of carolcos television distribution unit orbis communications including firstrun syndication rights to the
