nations it began with the founding of new france by samuel de champlain in the early s and continued well into the th century long after france was no longer a force in north america the authors keen

engendered and still thriving their french lingua franca and their ways of life back into the heart of the narrative of north american history where they belong songs upon the rivers also challenges historical orthodoxies regarding the canadien metis these descendants of the french with mixed ancestry developed a hybrid culture with close kinship ties with indigenous peoples across the continent
