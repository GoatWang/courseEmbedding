the same quarter a year ago the ratio of loan loss reserves to loans was  at june   compared to  at march   and  at june   at june   total loan loss reserves to loans excluding acquired loans was  investments the investment portfolio decreased  million from the prior quarter to  million the decrease was primarily due to principal paydowns and maturities partially offset by purchases of  million during the second quarter given the interest rate environment the bank opted to leave excess cash at the federal reserve bank as a shortterm investment alternative deposits onbalance sheet deposits increased to  million at june   compared to  million at march   the quarterly increase was primarily due to  million in offbalance sheet funds returned in the second quarter from our third party deposit networks we continue to see fluctuations from large deposit clients seasonal cash flows and the placement by existing clients of funds from asset sales that will be distributed to the beneficiaries of trusts or transitioned into real estate or other investments earnings “the second quarter  results affirm the success of our efforts to grow organically” said tani girton chief financial officer “our hard work and commitment to relationship banking are also paying off with a stronger net interest margin improved efficiency ratio and  return on assets” net interest income totaled  million in the second quarter of  compared to  million in the prior quarter actions by the federal open market committee to increase rates in december  march  and june  have positively impacted yields on our rate sensitive interest earning assets additionally the increase in net interest income from the prior quarter reflects slightly higher acquired loan income as shown in the table below and an increase of  million in average earnings assets net interest income of  million in the second quarter of  increased  million from  million for the same quarter last year the increase was primarily driven by a  million increase in interest earning assets in addition the second quarter of  included a  thousand prepayment fee on the retirement of a federal home loan bank fhlb fixed advance higher yields on investment securities and interestbearing cash and upward repricing of variable rate loans also positively impacted interest income net interest income totaled  million in the first six months of  compared to  million for the same period in  the  thousand increase primarily relates to a  million increase in average earning assets compared to june   a decrease in interest expense resulting from a prepayment fee and interest associated with the retirement of a fhlb fixed advance in june  and a decline in rates paid on deposits additionally the higher yield on investment securities and interestbearing cash and the upward repricing of variable rate loans positively impacted interest income partially offset by a decrease of  thousand in acquired loan income and a decline in the yield on fixed rate loans when compared to june   the taxequivalent net interest margin was  in the second quarter of  compared to  in the prior quarter and  in the same quarter a year ago the increase of six basis points in the second quarter of  compared to the prior quarter is primarily due to an increase in the yield on earning assets and increased acquired loan income loans acquired through the acquisition of other banks are classified as purchased credit impaired pci or nonpci loans and are recorded at fair value at acquisition date for acquired loans not considered credit impaired the level of accretion varies due to maturities and early payoffs accretion on pci loans fluctuates based on changes in cash flows expected to be collected gains on payoffs of pci loans are recorded as interest income when the payoff amounts exceed the recorded investment as our acquired loans continue to pay off we expect the accretion on acquired loans to continue to decline accretion and gains on payoffs of purchased loans recorded to interest income were as follows       three months ended june     march       june   dollars in thousands unaudited

the first half of  noninterest expense totaled  million in the second quarter of   million in the prior quarter and  million in the same quarter a year ago the decrease from the prior quarter was primarily due to a reversal of the provision for losses on offbalance sheet commitments the reversal resulted from a decrease in total commitments during the quarter primarily driven by the completion and payoff of a construction project an increase in average commitment usage and a reduction of estimated loss factors lower personnel expense also contributed to the decrease in noninterest expense from the prior quarter the decrease in k employer contribution as maximum employer match has been reached and deferrals of loan origination costs were partially offset by an increase in salaries due to additional fulltime equivalent personnel and annual merit increases the increase from the same quarter a year ago was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits related to filling open positions and incentive bonus as well as higher occupancy expense and recruiting fees these increases were partially offset by the reversal of provision for losses on offbalance sheet commitments discussed above noninterest expense totaled  million in the first half of  compared to  million in the first half of  the increase was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits related to filling open positions which resulted in additional incentive bonus stockbased compensation and k employer match the search for qualified employees resulted in recruiting fees which contributed to an increase in

of marin bancorp  madera boulevard corte madera ca  phone  bank of marin bancorp print version interview conducted by walter banks publisher ceocfointerviewscom published � may   ceocfo mr colombo what is your vision for the bank of marin mr colombo �i�ve been ceo since july of  and we are a community bank that serves three counties in northern california san francisco marin county which is on the other side of the golden gate bridge in san francisco and sonoma county which is directly north of that this community that we serve is a fairly affluent community the medium household income is about twice what the average in the state and in the country as well so we have a lot of wealth here however in an area that primarily has a very low population growth there is a lot of accumulation of wealth our vision as we go forward is to serve our communities and continue to expand in the contiguous counties around our market we just passed a billion dollars in assets on december   we provide a variety of services and lending facilities to consumers and small businesses in our market we do not offer residential mortgages but other than that we offer a pretty broad array of business products and loans such as commercial real estate commercial loans and consumer loans such as home equity loans and other types of consumer loans our vision as we go forward is to continue to grow and to be the dominant community bank of our market�   ceocfo you�ve grown to a billion in assets would you tell us how you got there mr colombo �all of the growth for this bank since we started  years ago has been organic we have  branch offices  in marin county  in sonoma county petaluma and one loan production office not a full branch in san francisco we have not made any acquisitions in our history we maintain a culture of serving our communities and giving back to the communities that we serve our loan growth was very strong in  and we had  loan growth credit quality remains good fourth quarter wasn�t as good as historical numbers but we were still very profitable and made  million in the fourth quarter and for the year over  million contrary to many banks theses days we�re in very good financial condition i look at that and i think it�s a function that we stayed pretty true to our communities and did not venture into other areas looking for growth it served us well because there�s not a lot of big residential development here in marin county so we haven�t had the problems that so many communities have had with subprime mortgages and the over building of single family homes�   ceocfo are you still considered a de novo mr colombo �we were de novo back in  as a  billion bank while it�s relatively small to the big banks in our market we are the largest community bank�   ceocfo what are your plans for future growth mr colombo �when we look at growth we look at it from three perspectives we have been working really hard to expand our product offerings to our small business clients we have a very strong presence in this community and we�re trying to expand the product offerings so that we can expand the services that we provide them and continue to build that market share secondly we�re focused on growing our market share in marin county and sonoma by developing new businesses and taking market share from our competitors thirdly we�re looking at expanding outside of our market our san francisco loan production office was our first venture outside of our existing footprint and now we�re expanding that office to grow our business development efforts in east bay so that we build our commercial banking activity we think it is important to build our commercial banking activities because that grows the core deposit base of the bank which is our real strength about  of our deposits are in demand deposits and that really is the value of our franchise�   ceocfo is your focus more on commercial or consumer at this point mr colombo �we�re more of a commercial bank but we like to consider ourselves as a community bank when you look at deposits in marin county on the business side we have about  market share and on the consumer side it�s much less our total market share deposits are about  we have built the bank by serving the small business man and the consumer growth has really been a function of that in other words we bank the individuals who have businesses it starts out more as a business bank but we also offer many consumer products other than residential mortgages�   ceocfo you mentioned that you are in a wealth growth area has the economic downturn affected the bank of marin mr colombo �it certainly has affected us while this county is more resilient than most it certainly has been impacted the retail sales are down and the unemployment is up but relative to other communities it�s not nearly as bad when i think of that i look at the fact that there hasn�t been a lot of new residential development in markets which has been a catalyst for all of the problems in areas like sacramento where there is huge residential development they have problems which causes commercial real estate problems we do a lot of commercial real estate lending but we are in markets that are relatively mature so you don�t� have the kind of problems that come with the high growth new development areas therefore we�ve been impacted relatively less than the rest of the country this county is in pretty good shape�   ceocfo did you participate in the tarp funding mr colombo �yes we chose to participate in the tarp funding but have already repurchased the  million in preferred stock that was originally issued when we received the tarp funding we were  and still are  a very healthy bank and only had to leverage that twice in order for it to be eps neutral the reality was we received our funding on december th and by december st we had lent out  million at that time we viewed the program as an opportunity for a good bank to increase capital and leverage that capital with more lending to the communities we serve we didn�t take it because we needed it but the rules of the tarp program changed and we felt it would negatively impact our customers shareholders and employees and overall how we run our organization as an independent business we are still a very healthy stable bank and well capitalized with a riskbased capital ratio exceeding the regulatory standard for a �well capitalized� institution   ceocfo capitalization is key for banks mr colombo �we clearly are not leveraged as high as the investment banks and we have not taken the risky portfolio positions that the investment banks do we have a very well diversified loan portfolio our credit under writing is very conservative and has been consistently applied over the years we�ve had very high capital ratio and we decided that this would be a good opportunity to expand that capital ratio at a  capital ratio we are in a pretty good position to weather even more significant downturn than we�ve had thus far we thought that was important to protect our shareholders and to protect the organization even if there are problems however if there weren�t we have a lot of capital to grow the bank even further clearly we�ve gone over a billion dollars with a very significant loan growth in  and we�re anticipating that  will continue that trend�   ceocfo would you ever consider making acquisitions as a part of your growth strategy mr colombo �the bank has never made an acquisition however if an opportunity came along that would enhance our franchise we would certainly consider it we keep our eyes open and it�s not like we would never do it we would not make an acquisition however that jumped over a market or was not contiguous of existing markets�   ceocfo what would you say sets you apart and gives you an edge on you competition with both the smaller community banks and the larger community banks in your area mr colombo �i think the real edge is with being a community bank the businesses that are located in this area can come to us and actually deal with bankers that take the time to understand the business and provide a service level that the bigger banks can�t and won�t do we�re part of this community so we collect deposits from our markets and then we reinvest in our communities we�re not collecting deposits in marin and lending in sacramento we�re keeping it local on top of that we have a very high level of service and we�re a high touch bank that means better communication with our customers and that�s what�s important when customers have problems they want a bank that has taken the time to understand what they do another advantage is that from a structural standpoint we are very well capitalized as i talked about the real value of our franchise is our core deposit ratio we have  in demand deposits and when you add savings and now accounts to that over  of our funding is in either no interest or very low interest accounts our cost of funds in total is just over  and our net interest margin is  so that�s a tremendous advantage over our competition�   ceocfo do you have the products that you feel are necessary for what your customers are asking for or are there products that you think you�ll be adding mr colombo �the last couple of years we have been focusing on bringing on the kind of products that our business customers need we brought on remote deposit capture positive pay and automated lock box and we�ve wrapped all of our business offering into a product offering that we call bam which is business account management our cash management products are up to date our business internet banking is top quality we�re able to go to our clients and offer the same types of services that they would get from a bigger bank with a much higher level of service what we want to do is to focus on building loyalty with our clients and having them understand the value proposition that we offer versus banking with some other organization�   ceocfo in closing why should potential investors put bank of marin bancorp on their radar and would you ever consider going to the street for funding mr colombo �we are a public company and we are traded on nasdaq capital markets we have about  million shares outstanding we�re trading currently about just over book for a bank like ours our multiple is  � times earnings which is pretty low but financials in general are being dragged down by all of the mess that is going on i personally think that we have a very strong market niche and if you look historically the trading values for banks like ours are a a lot higher than we are currently trading if you look at our organization the fundamentals are very good conservative underwriting high core deposit ratio a good diversification of loans no residential mortgages and not a lot of borrowing most of our funding is deposit based as opposed to the borrowing a lot of money from the federal home loan bank we have a product called cdars which is a deposit product where we offer cds that you can have fdic insurance up to  million technically that�s called a brokered deposit but it�s all with our customers and we don�t do other brokered deposits we�re gathering deposits in our market and lending them out in these markets and that�s a key strength we have such a strong deposit base that the chances of a liquidity crisis which in my view is a big risk for some banks that borrow a lot of money is very low and we have managed that pretty well overall we have a very bright future because of the fundamentals of our business� disclaimers any reproduction or further distribution of this article without the express written consent of ceocfointerviewscom

million in the first quarter of  compared to  million in the prior quarter and  million in the same quarter a year ago the decrease from earlier quarters was primarily due to a decline in gains on early payoffs of acquired loans and purchased loan accretion as shown in the table below in addition there were fewer days in the first quarter of  these variances were partially offset by an increase in the yield on investment securities in the first quarter of  finally average earning assets were higher in  compared to the first quarter of  while interest expense was lower as a result of the federal home loan bank fhlb fixed rate advance prepayment last year the taxequivalent net interest margin was  in the first quarter of  compared to  in the prior quarter and  in the same quarter a

fhlb stock and  thousand in gains on the sale of investment securities in the fourth quarter of  these decreases were partially offset by an increase in fees collected on oneway deposit sales placed with third party deposit networks in the first quarter of  the decrease from the same quarter last year is partially due to a  thousand gain on the sale of securities in the first quarter of  and lower wealth management and trust services fees in  partially offset by an increase of  thousand in cash dividends on fhlb stock and  thousand in fees collected on oneway deposit sales this year noninterest expense totaled  million in the first quarter of   million in the prior quarter and  million in the same quarter a year ago the increase from both the fourth quarter and the first quarter
