global managed futures fund the objective of the funds investments is to achieve a high riskadjusted return in combination with a low correlation with the stock and bond markets the target is to generate an average yearly return of 2 percent subject to a risk level defined as a yearly standard deviation of 8 percent the fund invests in futures contracts on the global futures markets the funds holdings can be divided into four types of assets stock indices fixedincome currencies and commodities lynxs main approach is systematic trendfollowing applied to a broadly diversified portfolio of markets further diversification is achieved by using models over multiple time frames with holding periods varying from a couple of hours up to a year or more the programme also trades contrarian models in an attempt to achieve better riskadjusted returns and enhance performance in a nontrending market environment intermarket models use other inputs than the price in the market itself there is also a shortterm module where trades are held from a few hours to a few days in aggregate these models are used to make quantitative analyses of price fluctuations on the market they are designed to identify market situations in which there is an enhanced probability that future price changes will be in a certain direction by using different models in conjunction with each other on each market the programme can generate a more stable riskadjusted return than a pure trendfollowing strategy risk management is an integrated feature in the investment process and lynx focuses on diversification and portfolio construction around  futures markets are traded across four sectors equity indices fixed income currencies and commodities position sizes are determined based on correlations with other markets the models operate independently and the portfolio is built bottomup based on the signals from each model minimization of each investments loss is integrated in the design of the models eg by using automated stoploss mechanisms as a result the risk utilization in the programme changes dynamically over time limiting drawdowns valueatrisk is used to limit position concentration and risk levels three parallel varmodels are monitored in realtime by the trading desk and there are limits on instrument asset class and total portfolio level lynx  bermuda ltd  pooled investment fund
