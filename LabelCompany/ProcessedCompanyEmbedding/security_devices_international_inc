in jacksonville fl sdi will supply bips and payload projectiles to safariland for integration with safarilands proprietary propulsion system these new rounds will be marketed under the defense technology brand name the first shipment of rounds was made as of the date of this press release sdi believes that this agreement with safariland validates the more than five years of research and development that sdi has invested in the creation of the collapsible head mm round sdi further believes that by working in partnership with safariland together the companies can reach a far larger market for the bip than sdi would be able to reach on its own security devices international inc announced delayed q filing apr   on  security devices international inc announced that they will be unable to file their next q by the deadline required by the sec security devices international inc enters into oem agreement with mission less lethal mar   security devices international inc announced the signing of a multiyear oem agreement with mission less lethal mission under this agreement sdi will be able to offer its customers a full line of  caliber chemical irritant projectiles and airpowered launchers produced by mission less lethal the  caliber launchers and projectiles are an important addition to sdi’s line of less lethal munitions currently sdi’s product line the blunt impact projectile bip leads the mm highkinetic less lethal segment in range accuracy and most importantly safety capable of delivering over  joules of kinetic energy the bip is designed to stop an assailant with a single shot without causing permanent injury or death similarly sdi’s extensive range of  gauge munitions including bean bags rubber finned rockets rubber balls and door breaching rounds provide law enforcement with a wide array of less lethal tools producing between  joules of energy these products offer a complete solution set in the midtohigh kinetic segment now the addition of a  caliber line of chemical irritant projectiles and launchers fills a critical gap in sdi’s offering by servicing the low kinetic impact segment at only  joules of energy these systems rely more on the dispersion of chemical irritants than on impact energy together these products give sdi and their customer agencies the most comprehensive range of less lethal solutions available similar

will get it started h ago view image credit save save share the best home security system take a look at livewatch the sweethome  in home comments  shares share tweet share save by grant clauser this post was done in partnership with the sweethome a buyers guide to the best things for your home read the full article here after  hours of research and a month spent testing six home security systems were confident that the livewatch total home  video is the best selfinstalled wireless home security solution for most people livewatch offers reliable equipment fair monthly monitoring prices and an innovative groupmessaging system that can help protect your family and reduce the likelihood of falsealarm fines livewatch also doesnt lock you into years of payments unlike most security companies how we picked and testedwe narrowed down our list to six systems for testing heres some of the aftermath photo grant clauser for this article we considered only selfinstalled wireless security systems with continuous professional monitoring via a cellular connection professional monitoring means that someone is always available to respond to an alarm and can contact local emergency services for you if necessary most home insurance companies offer premium discounts for monitored alarm systems but not for unmonitored ones a cellular connection means the system cant be disabled by cutting your landline or cable connection the control panel also needs a battery backup so the system still works if your power goes out we also looked for companies with short or no contracts and without high cancellation fees a few newer companies are now offering payasyouneed systems without contracts we didnt consider any for our main pick but called in several as a possible alternate recommendation in addition to our testing we sent a lengthy questionnaire to each vendor and asked about not only its technology but also asked for such information as ul certifications and details about its user contracts and policieswe didnt consider any alarm systems that required professional installation because a reader survey we conducted showed us that people are much more interested in diy systems modern wireless security systems are easy to install and professionally installed systems usually cost a lot more and have much more onerous contract terms we also didnt test any of the thousands of local and regional alarm companies because there are far too many to account for the selfinstalled systems we tested should be available throughout the uswe called in six selfinstalled security systems and used them for four weeks testing their control panels motion sensors contact sensors sirens cameras and smartphone appsour picklivewatch offers short contracts with no early termination fees and includes a feature that lets your household group chat in the event of an alarm photo grant clauser the livewatch total home  video system offers the best combination of reliable equipment comprehensive smarthome options and flexible nocontract professionalmonitoring plans in our tests it proved easy for us to set up and dependable in operation its touchscreen control panel and smartphone app are simple to use with its most important functions easily accessible from the main screen you can expand the livewatch system to include security cameras smart locks garage door openers and other zwave devices it also has a reasonable upfront price and monthly monitoring fee which when coupled with the lack of a lockin contract makes livewatch a safer investment than similar home security systemsone of livewatchs unique features is a system called asaper when an alarm is triggered it sends your family and emergency contacts a text message with a link to a text chat users can confirm the emergency or declare it a false alarm this way the person with the best knowledge of the situation such as the person at home who accidentally tripped the system can let everyone else know that things are fine or that theyre not fine its a nice feature works fast and should help put your familys mind at ease and reduce false alarmsa good budget optionsimplisafes equipment looks a bit clunky compared with livewatchs seeker touchscreen photo grant clauser if youre looking for much cheaper monitoring without a contract and you dont mind paying more up front for the equipment we like simplisafe it is easy to set up and doesnt require a contract and its monthly monitoring is half the price of livewatchs unlike livewatchs system simplisafes system doesnt integrate with other homeautomation or smarthome devices and it doesnt have video cameras yet still the equipment and smartphone app though basic do their one job well as with livewatch you can cancel simplisafes monitoring at any time and then start up again later if your needs change—although both systems are effectively useless without monitoring if youre not at homesetup care maintenance and local feesmost security companies offer preconfigured starter packages but those packages may not be enough to cover your whole house but adding loads of sensors can drastically increase the initial price of the system so dont rush to cover every square inchyou should have contact sensors that trigger when opened on every entrance door to your house but you probably dont need them for every operable window if theres no easy way into your second floor for instance you can probably skip sensors for those upstairs windows you likely also dont need motion detectors in every room—one or two on the main floor are usually enough once you get a system the company should let you put it in test mode to check for obvious holeswhen you order your security system the company should also let you know whether your municipality requires an alarm permit and should walk you through the steps to get one without one you could face hefty falsealarm fees you should also make sure you know how your local police department treats alarms from monitored security systems or reports from owners based on unmonitored systems in los angeles for instance all alarm calls must be verified either by an eyewitness or video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphonelow batteries in sensors can trigger false alarms and so can sensors that have fallen off the wall due to worn out doublesided tape to avoid a visit from the police—and a fine—its important that you test your sensors frequently to make sure theyre still reporting to the system the way theyre supposed to and you should also give the devices a tug now and then to make sure theyre securethis guide may have been updated by the sweethome to see the current recommendation please go here m m ago in mobile bandsintown concertdiscovery app amps up

ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a
