have to over time they can gain more by losing less august  share gain by losing less there are two ways to beat the index and fuel investment growth – earn more than the market or lose less than the market losing less – the socalled lowdownside capture approach – holds appeal for investors especially considering that  of them list protecting assets as their top investment priority but only about half are aware that index funds expose them to  of market downturns  downside capture a fund’s downside capture ratio is an indication of whether a fund has lost more or less than the market during periods of market weakness for example if over the course of a downturn a fund fell only  as far as the market its downside capture ratio is  if it fell  more than the market its downside capture ratio is   see how american funds delivered indexbeating returns by losing less a closer look at the power of low “downside capture” shows how our us stock focused goods have tended to beat the index even as they trailed the market during the good times  why it matters consistently losing less during downturns can be instrumental in producing larger balances and superior outcomes for longterm investors funds that limit downside risk tend to also provide a smoother ride making it easier for those with longterm objectives to stay the course during turbulent markets the arithmetic of loss the ability to achieve superior outcomes by losing less is an example of what’s known as the arithmetic of loss consider the following if a  investment loses  its value drops to  in order for the investment to return to the  level that  must do more than gain  which would only bring it to  it needs to double digging out of a hole is never easy but the shallower the hole the shorter the climb better positioned by losing less the farther an investment falls the longer the path back to break even some funds offer the potential to hold on to more of one’s investment during market declines which leaves investors better positioned for a rebound to mitigate risk seek funds that have held up better during declines looking at a fund’s downside capture ratio — a comparison of how far it has fallen relative to its index during downturns — is one way to evaluate its riskiness when we added downside capture to two other screening criteria — low expenses and high levels of manager investment — we uncovered a group of funds that has on average delivered indexbeating results finding funds that can mitigate risk within the universe of large cap us funds screening for funds with downside resilience — funds that capture less of a market decline than the index — results in a lower risk group that on average outpaced its peers as well as the sp  index further narrowing the lowdownside group using low expenses and high manager ownership as additional screening criteria increased the advantage over the index and reduced risk further the chart shown here is based on data for rolling

not surprising that funds from investment managers who “eat their own cooking” — investing more of their own money in the funds they oversee — have tended to outpace the market index more frequently than their peers it’s also logical that funds with lower expense ratios have tended to outpace the index more frequently combining these two traits — high manager ownership and low expense ratios — can help you identify a select group of funds with a track record of outpacing indexes over long periods characteristics of core funds that added value two screens can help sharpen your search source capital group based on morningstar® data narrowing your search the sheer number of available funds can be overwhelming we examined the large universe of equity funds in morningstar’s us and foreign

characteristics highest manager ownership and lowest expense ratios meaningfully improved average outcomes for investors look for funds that meet two key criteria largecap equity funds with low expense ratios and high manager ownership source capital group based on morningstar data boosting success rates as shown in the chart below not all funds are equal most in fact rarely outpace the index however funds with the lowest expenses have tended to do better than their peers and funds with high manager ownership have done even better than that significantly the group of funds that share both those characteristics have done better over five and year periods a portfolio of largecap funds with lower expense ratios and higher manager ownership on average outpaced indexes more frequently

matters choosing an investment manager with a solid track record can make the difference between financial success and shortfall share compare outcomes of our investment management vs passive management the indexing debate isn’t just an academic exercise you have real goals and financial needs how can you increase the likelihood of success choosing an investment manager that has consistently outpaced the broad market is crucial the right decision can make a big difference in longterm investment outcomes for instance this chart shows the results of a hypothetical  investment over  years in a blend of relevant indexes compared to equityfocused american funds for an investor who contributed  a month for  years the american funds would have provided an ending value  greater than the index blend that’s  more wealth the capital advantage℠ can be the difference between success and shortfall equityfocused american funds provided a significant advantage for investors data from published sources calculated internally the capital advantage over the life cycle of an investor through both the accumulation phase and the retirement income stage incremental gains can make a big difference largecap equity funds account for the biggest slice of most portfolio allocations so improving results in that core could have meaningful benefits historically using screens to find those funds with the highest management ownership and lowest cost would have significantly improved outcomes this chart shows the investment outcomes of a hypothetical investor over a year cycle american funds would have outpaced the indexes and our peers investors would have created more wealth with a core of screened largecap equity funds data from published sources calculated internally  the results for the american funds are class a shares the k hypothetical amonth investment represents a total of  for the year period ended december   data from published sources were calculated internally for the constituents of the american funds and index blend as well as additional details about the data see methodology  the results for american funds core are class a shares hypothetical results assume reinvestment of all dividends the average annual return and ending investment values for all three investments take into account withdrawals and portfolios were rebalanced monthly for the equity core allocation hypothetical results are based on averages of rolling year periods of monthly returns from january  to december  and portfolios were rebalanced monthly past results are not predictive of results in future periods the index core represents an equally divided allocation between the sp  index and msci acwi ex usa the screened equity core comprises actively managed funds in morningstar’s largecap categories that fall within both the least expensive net expense ratio and the highest firmlevel manager ownership quartiles the american funds core represents a  allocation to seven equally weighted usfocused american funds and a  allocation to two equally weighted foreignfocused american funds the constituents of each allocation can be found on the methodology page these sample portfolios exclude fixed income allocations typical of core portfolio holdings the indexes are unmanaged and therefore have no expenses investors cannot invest directly in an index   figures shown are past results and are not predictive of results in future periods current and future results may be lower or higher than those shown share prices and returns will vary so investors may lose money investing for short periods makes losses more likely view fund expense ratios and returns  returns shown at net asset value nav have all distributions reinvested if a sales charge had been

objective the spdr sp international small cap etf the “fund” seeks to provide investment results that before fees and expenses correspond generally to the total return performance of an index based upon the developed world exus small cap equity markets fees and expenses of the fund the table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund “fund shares” this table and the example below reflect the expenses of the fund and do not reflect brokerage commissions you may pay on purchases and sales of fund shares annual fund operating expenses expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment management fees  distribution and service b fees none other expenses  total annual fund operating expenses    the funds “total annual fund operating expenses” have been restated to reflect a reduction in the funds “management fees” example this example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds the example assumes that you invest  in the fund for the time periods indicated and then sell all of your fund shares at the end of those periods the example also assumes that your investment has a  return each year and that the funds operating expenses remain the same although your actual costs may be higher or lower based on these assumptions your costs would be year  year  year  year      portfolio turnover the fund pays transaction costs such as commissions when it buys and sells securities or “turns over” its portfolio a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account these costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example affect the funds performance  during the most recent fiscal year the funds portfolio turnover rate was  of the average value of its portfolio the funds principal investment strategy in seeking to track the performance of the sp developed exus under usd billion index the “index” the fund employs a sampling strategy which means that the fund is not required to purchase all of the securities represented in the index instead the fund may purchase a subset of the securities in the index in an effort to hold a portfolio of securities with generally the same risk and return characteristics of the index the quantity of holdings in the fund will be based on a number of factors including asset size of the fund based on its analysis of these factors ssga funds management inc “ssga fm” or the “adviser” the investment adviser to the fund may invest the funds assets in a subset of securities in the index or may invest the funds assets in substantially all of the securities represented in the index in approximately the same proportions as the index state street global advisors  of    spdr ® sp ® international small cap etf under normal market conditions the fund generally invests substantially all but at least  of its total assets in the securities comprising the index or in american depositary receipts “adrs” or global depositary receipts “gdrs” based on securities comprising the index the fund will provide shareholders with at least  days notice prior to any material change in this  investment policy in addition the fund may invest in equity securities that are not included in the index including common stock preferred stock depositary receipts and shares of other investment companies cash and cash equivalents or money market instruments such as repurchase agreements and money market funds including money market funds advised by the adviser the index is a market capitalization weighted index designed to define and measure the investable universe of publicly traded smallcap companies as defined by the index domiciled in developed countries outside the united states the index component securities are a subset based on market capitalization and region of component securities included in the sp global bmi broad market index “global equity index” the global equity index is a comprehensive floatweighted rulesbased benchmark that is readily divisible and customizable a country will be eligible for inclusion in the global equity index if it is classified as either a developed or emerging market by the sp global equity index committee country classification is reviewed annually and determined based on quantitative criteria and feedback from market participants via a publicly available market consultation all publicly listed companies with floatadjusted market capitalization of a minimum of  million and at least  million annual trading volume are included for each country once included all current global equity index constituents with floatadjusted market capitalization of a minimum of  million and at least  million annual trading volume will remain in the global equity index for each country all stocks are weighted proportionate to their floatadjusted market capitalization and the index is rebalanced annually the index is “floatadjusted” meaning that only those shares publicly available to investors are included in the index calculation to be included in the index a publicly listed company must have a total market capitalization between  million and  billion and be located in a country that meets the bmi developed world series criteria countries covered in the index have historically included among others australia austria belgium canada denmark finland france germany greece hong kong ireland israel italy japan luxembourg the netherlands new zealand norway portugal singapore south korea spain sweden switzerland and the united kingdom as of november   a significant portion of the index comprised companies in the industrial financial and consumer discretionary sectors although this may change from time to time  as of november   a significant portion of the fund comprised companies located in japan although this may change from time to time as of december   the index comprised  securities the index is sponsored by sp dow jones indices llc the “index provider” which is not affiliated with the fund or the adviser the index provider determines the composition of the index relative weightings of the securities in the index and publishes information regarding the market value of the index principal risks of investing in the fund as with all investments there are certain risks of investing in the fund fund shares will change in value and you could lose money by investing in the fund an investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency consumer discretionary sector risk the success of consumer product manufacturers and retailers is tied closely to the performance of the overall global economy interest rates competition and consumer confidence success depends heavily on disposable household income and consumer spending also companies in the consumer discretionary sector may be subject to severe competition which may have an adverse impact on their respective profitability changes in demographics and consumer tastes can also affect the demand for and success of consumer products and services in the marketplace currency risk the value of the funds assets may be affected favorably or unfavorably by currency exchange rates currency exchange control regulations and restrictions or prohibitions on the repatriation of foreign currencies foreign currency exchange rates may have significant volatility and changes in the values of foreign currencies against the us dollar may result in substantial declines in the values of the funds assets denominated in foreign currencies depositary receipts risk investments in depositary receipts may be less liquid and more volatile than the underlying securities in their primary trading market if a depositary receipt is denominated in a different currency than its underlying securities the fund will be subject to the currency risk of both the investment in the depositary receipt and the underlying security holders of depositary receipts may have limited or no rights to take action with respect to the underlying securities or to compel the issuer of the receipts to take action equity investing risk the market prices of equity securities owned by the fund may go up or down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably the value of a security may decline for a number of reasons that may directly relate to the issuer and also may decline due to general industry or market conditions that are not specifically related to a particular company in addition equity markets tend to move in cycles which may cause stock prices to fall over short or extended periods of time state street global advisors  of    spdr ® sp ® international small cap etf financial sector risk financial services companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation which may limit both the amounts and types of loans and other financial commitments they can make the interest rates and fees they can charge the scope of their activities the prices they can charge and the amount of capital they must maintain profitability is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change or due to increased competition in addition deterioration of the credit markets generally may cause an adverse impact in a broad range of markets including us and international credit and interbank money markets generally thereby affecting a wide range of financial institutions and markets certain events in the financial sector may cause an unusually high degree of volatility in the financial markets both domestic and foreign and cause certain financial services companies to incur large losses securities of financial services companies may experience a dramatic decline in value when such companies experience substantial declines in the valuations of their assets take action to raise capital such as the issuance of debt or equity securities or cease operations credit losses resulting from financial difficulties of borrowers and financial losses associated with investment activities can negatively impact the sector insurance companies may be subject to severe price competition adverse economic business or political developments affecting real estate could have a major effect on the value of real estate securities which include real estate investment trusts “reits” declining real estate values could adversely affect financial institutions engaged in mortgage finance or other lending or investing activities directly or indirectly connected to the value of real estate geographic focus risk the performance of a fund that is less diversified across countries or geographic regions will be closely tied to market currency economic political environmental or regulatory conditions and developments in the country or region in which the fund invests and may be more volatile than the performance of a more geographicallydiversified fund japan the growth of japans economy has historically lagged that of its asian neighbors and other major developed economies the japanese economy is heavily dependent on international trade and has been adversely affected by trade tariffs other protectionist measures competition from emerging economies and the economic conditions of its trading partners china has become an important trading partner with japan yet the countries political relationship has become strained should political tension increase it could adversely affect the economy especially the export sector and destabilize the region as a whole japan also remains heavily dependent on oil imports and higher commodity prices could therefore have a negative impact on the economy the japanese yen has fluctuated widely at times and any increase in its value may cause a decline in exports that could weaken the japanese economy japan has in the past intervened in the currency markets to attempt to maintain or reduce the value of the yen japanese intervention in the currency markets could cause the value of the yen to fluctuate sharply and unpredictably and could cause losses to investors natural disasters such as earthquakes volcanoes typhoons or tsunamis could occur in japan or surrounding areas and could negatively affect the japanese economy and in turn the fund index tracking risk while the adviser seeks to track the performance of the index  ie  achieve a high degree of correlation with the index the funds return may not match the return of the index the fund incurs a number of operating expenses not applicable to the index and incurs costs in buying and selling securities in addition the fund may not be fully invested at times generally as a result of cash flows into or out of the fund or reserves of cash held by the fund to meet redemptions the adviser may attempt to replicate the index return by investing in fewer than all of the securities in the index or in some securities not included in the index potentially increasing the risk of divergence between the funds return and that of the index industrial sector risk industrial companies are affected by supply and demand both for their specific product or service and for industrial sector products in general government regulation world events exchange rates and economic conditions technological developments and liabilities for environmental damage and general civil liabilities will likewise affect the performance of these companies aerospace and defense companies a component of the industrial sector can be significantly affected by government spending policies because companies involved in this industry rely to a significant extent on us and foreign government demand for their products and services thus the financial condition of and investor interest in aerospace and defense companies are heavily influenced by governmental defense spending policies which are typically under pressure from efforts to control the us and other government budgets transportation securities a component of the industrial sector are cyclical and have occasional sharp price movements which may result from changes in the economy fuel prices labor agreements and insurance costs liquidity risk lack of a ready market or restrictions on resale may limit the ability of the fund to sell a security at an advantageous time or price or at all illiquid securities may trade at a discount from comparable more liquid investments and may be subject to wide fluctuations in market value illiquidity of the funds holdings may limit the ability of the fund to obtain cash to meet redemptions on a timely basis in addition the fund due to limitations on investments in any illiquid securities andor the difficulty in purchasing and selling such investments may be unable to achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain market or sector market risk the funds investments are subject to changes in general economic conditions and general market fluctuations and the risks inherent in investment in securities markets investment markets can be volatile and prices of investments can change substantially due to various factors including but not limited to economic growth or recession changes in interest rates changes in state street global advisors  of    spdr ® sp ® international small cap etf the actual or perceived creditworthiness of issuers and general market liquidity the fund is subject to the risk that geopolitical events will disrupt securities markets and adversely affect global economies and markets nondiversification risk as a “nondiversified” fund the fund may hold a smaller number of portfolio securities than many other funds to the extent the fund invests in a relatively small number of issuers a decline in the market value of a particular security held by the fund may affect its value more than if it invested in a larger number of issuers the value of fund shares may be more volatile than the values of shares of more diversified funds nonus securities risk nonus securities including depositary receipts are subject to political regulatory and economic risks not present in domestic investments there may be less information publicly available about a nonus entity than about a us entity and many nonus entities are not subject to accounting auditing legal and financial report standards comparable to those in the unites states further such entities andor their securities may be subject to risks associated with currency controls expropriation changes in tax policy greater market volatility differing securities market structures higher transaction costs and various administrative difficulties such as delays in clearing and settling portfolio transactions or in receiving payment of dividends securities traded on foreign markets may be less liquid harder to sell than securities traded domestically foreign governments may impose restrictions on the repatriation of capital to the us in addition when the fund buys securities denominated in a foreign currency there are special risks such as changes in currency exchange rates and the risk that a foreign government could regulate foreign exchange transactions in addition to the extent investments are made in a limited number of countries events in those countries will have a more significant impact on the fund investments in depositary receipts may be less liquid and more volatile than the underlying shares in their primary trading market passive strategyindex risk the fund is managed with a passive investment strategy attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged index of securities regardless of the current or projected performance of the index or of the actual securities comprising the index this differs from an activelymanaged fund which typically seeks to outperform a benchmark index as a result the funds performance may be less favorable than that of a portfolio managed using an active investment strategy the structure and composition of the index will affect the performance volatility and risk of the index and consequently the performance volatility and risk of the fund smallcapitalization securities risk the securities of smallcapitalization companies may be more volatile and may involve more risk than the securities of larger companies these companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources may lack the competitive strength of larger companies and may depend on a few key employees in addition these companies may have been recently organized and may have little or no track record of success the securities of smaller companies may trade less frequently and in smaller volumes than more widely held securities some securities of smaller issuers may be illiquid or may be restricted as to resale and their values may have significant volatility the fund may be unable to liquidate its positions in such securities at any time or at a favorable price in order to meet the funds obligations returns on investments in securities of smallcapitalization companies could trail the returns on investments in securities of larger companies unconstrained sector risk the fund may invest a substantial portion of its assets within one or more economic sectors or industries which may change from time to time greater investment focus on one or more sectors or industries increases the potential for volatility and the risk that events negatively affecting such sectors or industries could reduce returns potentially causing the value of the funds shares to decrease perhaps significantly valuation risk some portfolio holdings potentially a large portion of the funds investment portfolio may be valued on the basis of factors other than market quotations this may occur more often in times of market turmoil or reduced liquidity there are multiple methods that can be used to value a portfolio holding when market quotations are not readily available the value established for any portfolio holding at a point in time might differ from what would be produced using a different methodology or if it had been priced using market quotations portfolio holdings that are valued using techniques other than market quotations including “fair valued” securities may be subject to greater fluctuation in their valuations from one day to the next than if market quotations were used in addition there is no assurance that the fund could sell or close out a portfolio position for the value established for it at any time and it is possible that the fund would incur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to the valuation established by the fund at that time investors who purchase or redeem fund shares on days when the fund is holding fairvalued investments may receive fewer or more shares or lower or higher redemption proceeds than they would have received if the fund had not fairvalued the holdings or had used a different valuation methodology state street global advisors  of    spdr ® sp ® international small cap etf fund performance the following bar chart and table

the index over longterm periods is a myth the potential for greater wealth as you can see an investment manager with a proven track record of outpacing the market can produce significantly greater wealth than an index investment a comparison of the lifetime results of the first index fund to the results of five american funds over that same period illustrates our advantage those funds are amcap

american funds have two important traits when you compare mutual funds it’s not surprising that funds from investment managers who “eat their own cooking” — investing more of their own money in the funds they oversee — have tended to outpace the market index more frequently than their peers it’s also logical that funds with lower expense ratios have tended to outpace the index more frequently combining these two traits — high manager ownership and low expense ratios — can help you identify a select group of funds with a track record of outpacing indexes over long periods characteristics of core funds that added value two screens can help sharpen your search source capital group based on morningstar® data narrowing your search the sheer number of available funds can be overwhelming we examined the large universe of equity funds in morningstar’s us and foreign largecap categories over a year period and looked for funds with two traits those within the lowest  of expenses and those within the highest  in manager ownership we found that the funds with both characteristics highest manager ownership and lowest expense ratios meaningfully improved average outcomes for investors look for funds that meet two key criteria largecap equity funds with low expense ratios and high manager ownership source capital group based on morningstar data boosting success rates as shown in the chart below not all funds are equal most in fact rarely outpace the index however funds with the lowest expenses have tended to do better than their peers and funds with high manager ownership have done even better than that significantly the group of funds that share both those characteristics have done better over five and year periods a portfolio of largecap funds with lower expense ratios

advantage select funds can reduce risk index funds fall as far as the market they track but investors don’t have to over time they can gain more by losing less august  share gain by losing less there are two ways to beat the index and fuel investment growth – earn more than the market or lose less than the market losing less – the socalled lowdownside capture approach – holds appeal for investors especially considering that  of them list protecting assets as their top investment priority but only about half are aware that index funds expose them to  of market downturns  downside capture a fund’s downside capture ratio is an indication of whether a fund has lost more or less than the market during periods of market weakness for example if over the course of a downturn a fund fell only  as far as the market its downside capture ratio is  if it fell  more than the market its downside capture ratio is   see how american funds delivered indexbeating returns by losing less a closer look at the power of low “downside capture” shows how our us stock focused goods have tended to beat the index even as they trailed the market during the good times  why it matters consistently losing less during downturns can be instrumental in producing larger balances and superior outcomes for longterm investors funds that limit downside risk tend to also provide a smoother ride making it easier for those with longterm objectives to stay the course during turbulent markets the arithmetic of loss the ability to achieve superior outcomes by losing less is an example of what’s known as the arithmetic of loss consider the following if a  investment loses  its value drops to  in order for the investment to return to the  level that  must do more than gain  which would only bring it to  it needs to double digging out of a hole is never easy but the shallower the hole the shorter the climb better positioned by losing less the farther an investment falls the longer the path back to break even some funds offer the potential to hold on to more of one’s investment during market declines which leaves investors better positioned for a rebound to mitigate risk seek funds that have held up better during declines looking at a fund’s downside capture ratio — a comparison of how far it has fallen relative to its index during downturns — is one way to evaluate its riskiness when we added downside capture to two other screening criteria — low expenses and high levels of manager investment — we uncovered a group of funds that has on average delivered indexbeating results finding funds that can mitigate risk within the universe of large cap us funds screening for funds with downside resilience — funds that capture less of a market decline than the index — results in a lower risk group that on average outpaced its peers as well as the sp  index further narrowing the lowdownside group using low expenses and high manager ownership as additional screening criteria increased the advantage over the index and reduced risk further the chart shown here is based on data for rolling fiveyear periods for the  years ended december   see methodology investments are not fdicinsured nor
