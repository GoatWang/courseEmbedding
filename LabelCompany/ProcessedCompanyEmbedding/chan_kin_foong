kin foong chan kin foong chan has filed for patents to protect the following inventions this listing includes patent applications that are pending as well as patents that have already been granted by the united states patent and trademark office uspto system and method for lossless data transmission patent number  abstract a method for losslessly transmitting data is provided the data is separated into two or more portions and the second portion is subtracted from the first portion to find a difference the first portion and the difference are transmitted and then the second portion is reconstructed by adding the difference to the first portion the data may comprise two or more images with each image being a temporally displaced version of the preceding image each image may be divided into multiple areas where the areas on each image correspond to the areas on the other images a difference may be obtained by subtracting each area of an image from the corresponding area of the preceding image the first image may then be transferred as a reference image along with the differences and each image may be reconstructed by adding each difference to the corresponding area of the previous image type grant filed february   date of patent june   assignee disco corporation inventors xiaoqi zhou wenhui mei takashi kanatake kin foong chan microlens array fabrication publication number  abstract a new and unique method for fabricating a microlens array is provided first a mask layer is applied to an optical substrate one or more holes are then created in the mask layer so that corresponding first cavities can then be created in the substrate each of these first cavities has a predetermined depth and a first width the mask layer is then removed so that one or more second cavities can be created in the substrate the second cavities corresponding with the first cavities each of these second cavities has approximately the same predetermined depth as the corresponding first cavity and having a second width greater than the first width type application filed december   publication date june   inventors wenhui mei kin foong chan ren yang nonsynchronous control of laser diode publication number  abstract a system and method for nonsynchronously projecting light in an imaging system is provided a pixel panel may be selectively controlled to direct light onto or away from a subject a light source such as a laser diode projects light pulses at the pixel panel the pulses are not synchronized with the pixel panel so the light may strike the pixel panel at any time when the pixel panel is operable to direct light towards the subject the pulses may be constant or variable in energy or duration depending on the desired results type application filed october   publication date may   inventor kin foong chan delivery mechanism for a laser diode array publication number  abstract a laser diode array light source includes a plurality of semiconductor diodes attached to a first substrate with each diode having an aperture for emitting an output of light positioned on a side of the diode the side being generally perpendicular to the first substrate a second substrate is positioned adjacent to the first substrate and includes a plurality of reflective surfaces for redirecting each of the outputs of light in this way the light from the plurality of diodes can be commonly directed to provide a directional light source type application filed august   publication date march   applicant ball semiconductor inc inventors kin foong chan wenhui mei takashi kanatake akira ishikawa toshio matsushita surface distortion compensated photolithography publication number  abstract a distortion compensation system for use in an imaging device such as a photolithography system is described the system projects a plurality of image portions onto a plurality of portions of a subject the system includes a plurality of lightdistance modulators corresponding to the plurality of image portions and a mechanical manipulator for individually manipulating each of the lightdistance modulators in this way any distortion in the subject is compensated by the individual manipulation of the lightdistance modulators type application filed december   publication date february   applicant ball semiconductor inc inventors kin foong chan wenhui mei light modulation device and system patent number  abstract a light modulation element device and system is discussed the light modulation element includes three electrodes a flexible member and a mirror the flexible member is connected between the three electrodes so that the first and second electrodes are on one side and the third electrode is on the opposite side of the flexible member the mirror is attached to the flexible member so that it can move therewith the flexible member moves responsive to an external electrostatic force provided by one or more of the three electrodes so that the mirror is positioned in a predetermined position responsive to the state of the flexible member type grant filed december   date of patent january   assignee ball semiconductor inc inventors wenhui mei kin foong chan dong youn sim light modulation device and system publication number  abstract a light modulation element device and system is discussed the light modulation element includes three electrodes a rigid member and a mirror the rigid member is connected between the three electrodes so that the first and second electrodes are on one side and the third electrode is on the opposite side of the rigid member the mirror is attached to the rigid member so that it can move therewith the rigid member moves responsive to an external electrostatic force provided by one or more of the three electrodes so that the mirror is positioned in a predetermined position responsive to the state of the rigid member type application filed november   publication date october

difference to the corresponding area of the previous image type application filed february   publication date september   applicant ball semiconductor inc inventors xiaoqi zhou wenhui mei takashi kanatake kin foong chan laser irradiation mapping system publication number  abstract a digital micromirror device is used in a semiautomated system to reflect a tailored portion of a laser beam according to image data that defines a mapped target area of an object for selective irradiation by the tailored laser beam a computer having an interface device such as a light pen is used to map the boundary on a computer screen of a target area of an object which may be the retina of a patients eye or some other object a projector cooperates with a laser source the digital micromirror device and the computer to enable a laser beam to be tailored to correspond to the irregular shape of the intended target area to avoid irradiating portions of the object other than the target area itself the system is capable of tracking movement of the target area and maintaining the tailored laser beam aligned to irradiate the target area during movement type application filed march   publication date september   applicant ball semiconductor inc inventors kin foong chan jeffrey whitman suzanne i ahn high power incoherent light source with laser array publication number  abstract a high power light source is provided the light source includes one or more diodes that may produce relatively coherent light of a desired intensity the diodes may be pulsed to provide light as desired the light projected by the diodes passes through a combiner which combines the light from the different diodes and passes the combined light to an incoherence apparatus the incoherence apparatus may include a rotating surface relief phase device such as an optical hologram a computer generated hologram or a diffractive optical element with random phase modulation the incoherence apparatus may include a rotating fiber conduit comprising a plurality of multifiber cores the incoherence apparatus renders the combined light incoherent and passes it to an illuminator apparatus that focuses the incoherent combined light onto an image plane type application filed march   publication date september   applicant ball semiconductor inc inventors jinhui zhai wenhui mei kin foong chan light modulation device and system patent number  abstract a light modulation element device and system is discussed the light modulation element includes three electrodes a flexible member and a mirror the flexible member
