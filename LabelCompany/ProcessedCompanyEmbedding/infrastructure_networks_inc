due to being a well established partner amongst all three we are extremely well versed in network infrastructure due to having a strong company background in network engineering we differentiate from the competition by being both a consumer of these products as well as an implementer this allows us to leverage knowledge that many other companies simply just dont have this also allows us to have a firm understanding of maintainability scalability and budget  we approach each project with the mindset of both an owneroperator as well as a consultant were more than happy to sell just the hardware to someone but we typically form relationships with our customers along the way cost features performance and ability to operate are amongst the things we consider when formulating an infrastructure plan can  the customer support the gear do they need our support we cover all bases and constantly think long term because we are used to doing it for ourselves  for many of our customers we are the operator of their networks so its not abnormal for us to spend a lot of time after the install making sure everything is as seamless as possible our expectation is to work with our customers for a long time and to make sure its done right the first time around  were extremely cost competitive if were helping design and implement a solution for a customer in addition to consultation and management we are not a transactually based business because and our customers arent just a number to us theyre an important part of our business and success which is why we value them so deeply we are a steady dependable trusted advisor and partner for many companies that have been with us for over a decade  how many integrators can say theyve done refresh cycles on their infrastructure   and  years later how many have even been in business that long almost none we could go on and on but the bottom line is that weve proven ourselves time and time again if you want a team who really knows what theyre doing and who has the tenuretrack record to prove it give us a call for a norisk nocost evaluation  salessemaphorecom phone  toll free semaphore            semaphore corporation infrastructure networks inc announces pilot lte deployment in the gulf of mexico infrastructure networks inc announces pilot lte deployment in the gulf of mexico mar    et from infrastructure networks inc houston march   prnewswire  infrastructure networks inc inet a leading provider of industrial lte wireless broadband services to oil and gas and other critical infrastructure industries is deploying a pilot lte system in the gulf of mexico inets pilot deployment will be used to demonstrate the superior capabilities of industrial lte wireless broadband service and coverage when coupled with  mhz spectrum that inet has leased from verizon wireless under the lte in rural america program  the pilot will be open to certain companies operating in the gulf of mexico that have expressed an interest in using the network for testing and planning larger lte rollouts tarig anani  ceo of infrastructure networks said the pilot deployment phase of our lte rollout will give customers an opportunity to test and preplan their own lte deployments in lockstep with infrastructure networks  for the pilot we have assembled a team of partners that bring unique capabilities resources and assets to the table he closed by saying we have seen great success with our onshore business and with the need for additional bandwidth realtime connectivity and the reliability of our industrial g lte network oil and gas companies have been requesting that we expand our coverage offshore our partnership approach to the gulf of mexico will allow us to leverage the value and expertise of our partners to deliver unrivaled highspeed bandwidth and low latency connectivity across a secure network  partners teaming with inet on the lte pilot include alcatellucent blackhawk datacom and lm botruc rental  alcatellucent will provide lte network equipment and the licensed microwave backhaul equipment for the lte pilot in the gulf of mexico  john dow vp of business development of americas wireless business for alcatellucent said deploying the first lte solution in the gulf of mexico will provide oil and gas companies a similar experience to what they have experienced onshore using inets commercial lte network  through this partnership we will deliver the most advanced wireless ultrabroadband services in the gulf of mexico providing faster connectivity and enabling advanced machinetomachine communications that was not previously available to the offshore oil and gas market philip liddell coo of infrastructure networks said infrastructure networks has worked hand in hand with alcatellucent since  successfully deploying over  square miles of industrial lte coverage throughout texas for the oil and gas industry  going offshore with alcatellucent was an easy decision based upon the experience both teams have in working together deploying lte services blackhawk datacom will provide offshore engineering and construction services  in addition they will be involved in testing several lte based enduser applications during the pilot period  blackhawk datacom has a long communications history in the gulf of mexico having deployed several generations of microwave point to point systems over the last  years john poindexter ceo of blackhawk datacom said we are very excited about the expanded opportunities that this technology brings to the gulf of mexico the model that has proven to be so successful in the us shale plays has the ability to bring significant cost savings to the gulf while enabling an entire new suite of edge technologies this could be a game changer in terms of the growth of digital oilfield capabilities one of the major advantages of lte is its ability to provide wireless broadband service to moving vessels  stanley hughey chief strategy officer of infrastructure networks said during our study of existing communications options in the gulf of mexico it became apparent that surface vessels operating offshore represented a large unserved market  once deployed inets lte network will offer the only communications solution that will allow a vessel to move seamlessly from port to sea without the use of expensive satellite equipment  he concluded by saying inets lte network availability coupled with the ability of customers to use their verizon lte handset offshore is a game changer for companies and personnel operating in the gulf  to demonstrate this capability lm botruc rental will deploy lte service on one of its fleet of offshore vessels during the pilot period jacob pitre vice president of operations for lm botruc rental said i am excited about the opportunity to have one of our vessels use this advanced wireless technology with inets lte deployment it will deliver high speed and improved connectivity which will provide efficiency in our operations in the gulf inet plans to begin establishing substantial lte network coverage over a wide area of the gulf of mexico upon the successful completion of
