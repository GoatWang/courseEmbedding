academy capital management homeintropeopleapproachservicesplanning interactive plannerresearchcontact academy capital managementmatching assets to plans in a low risk styleread more intro an introduction we are a boutique investment advisory firm  we help you whether as an individual a foundation and or as part of a company invest your assets  our approach is simple  we study your commitments and invest according to them  we look at when you need funds what kind of tax impact there might be and when there is an emergency what options are available  we do not subject you to the periodic fads which overtake the marketplace  we recommend longterm effectiveness rather than shortterm speculation  our mission and primary motivation is to help you match your assets with your commitments in a comfortable lowrisk way so that you can live better  our compensation structure is feebased in order to minimize misalignment between you and us  further our compensation does not include the widely used profit participations as we believe that these structures are excessively expensive  we believe that a flat percentage of assets under management fee is understandable can be structured fairly and is likely to be mutually agreeable over the long run if the job is well done  to further protect against misalignment we commit our own personal assets to the same portfolio stocks which we purchase for you  we believe that a good investment is a good investment regardless of age income or net worthwe provide this website in order to deepen your understanding of our investment process by providing planning interactive tools recent research on companies purchased and specific commentary we hope to provide you the investment confidence so critical in reducing emotional reactivity  you are an important partner in delivering superior results lets start your plan people joel adam cfainvestment managerjoel graduated from baylor university with a bba and mba

servicesbrings  years experience in office administration customer service and accountingmargie sheltonclient servicesbrings many years experience in office administration and customer service approach our advisory approach  three principlesacademy capital managements approach begins with several important principles  the first principle is liquidity  while illiquid investments such as private placements may yield higher returns at certain times your portfolios are invested so that you may easily withdraw  of the funds in cash  there are no lockup periods and no gated funds nor are there illiquid investments requiring a like kind distribution  the liquidity also means that the prices of portfolio investments are set by the market not by the investment manager  as often occurs with illiquid investments the second principle is margin of safety  our focus means paying a reduced price which helps protect your capital against unforeseen risks  this reduced price provides a margin of safety causing us to see greater safety and better opportunities where others are only seeing lower prices  the volatility of markets are invaluable in our quest for a margin of safety and cause us to disagree with theories such as modern portfolio theory mpt which associate greater volatility with greater risk the third principle is matching liabilities with assets  you have goals with varying time horizons ranging from shortterm  such as tax payments to intermediate  such as college funding and long term  such as retirement funding  as we become aware of these differences we identify which of our investments may be appropriate for you  the nature of your commitments determine our investment selection   we believe these commitments or liabilities best define your asset allocation by comparing the required distribution or growth rates with the yields that various portfolio investments generate both historically and currently based on these principles we limit our investments to selecting opportunistically from money market accounts mma us government bonds usg us government treasury inflation protection securities tips and common stocks  we do not invest in commodities because our preference is to invest in an asset class that is productive and does not depend on price rise potential  we do not invest in nonus listed common stocks because we do not adequately understand foreign exchanges  each category of investments that we use has its respective merits  for goals which are shortterm we recommend mmas and usgs whereas for intermediate and longterm goals we recommend a combination of tips and common stocks  client communicationswe communicate with you through a quarterly letter which discusses the current investing environment our firms investment results and our thoughts  these quarterly letters are supplemented with telephone calls personal meetings and this website  by using the website we make available to you resources that allow timely access to comprehending our process if you have greater clarity about our investment process it is more likely that your emotions will not become an impediment to investment success  the internet also allows us to communicate efficiently with you while maintaining our focus on the investment process  get started here  services financial managementall of our services are directed

investment advisory firm  we help you whether as an individual a foundation and or as part of a company invest your assets  our approach is simple  we study your commitments and invest according to them  we look at when you need funds what kind of tax impact there might be and when there is an emergency what options are available  we do not subject you to the periodic fads which overtake the marketplace  we recommend longterm effectiveness rather than shortterm speculation  our mission and primary motivation is to help you match your assets with your commitments in a comfortable lowrisk way so that you can live better  our compensation structure is feebased in order to minimize misalignment between you and us  further our compensation does not include the widely used profit participations as we believe that these structures are excessively expensive  we believe that a flat percentage of assets under management fee is understandable can be structured fairly and is likely to be mutually agreeable over the long run if the job is well done  to further protect against misalignment we commit our own personal assets to the same portfolio stocks which we purchase for you  we

administration customer service and accountingmargie sheltonclient servicesbrings many years experience in office administration and customer service approach our advisory approach  three principlesacademy capital managements approach begins with several important principles  the first principle is liquidity  while illiquid investments such as private placements may yield higher returns at certain times your portfolios are invested so that you may easily withdraw  of the funds in cash  there are no lockup periods and no gated funds nor are there illiquid investments requiring a like kind distribution  the liquidity also means that the prices of portfolio investments are set by the market not by the investment manager  as often occurs with illiquid investments the second principle is margin of safety  our focus means paying a reduced price which helps protect your capital against unforeseen risks  this reduced price provides a margin of safety causing us to see greater safety and better opportunities where others are only seeing lower prices  the volatility of markets are invaluable in our quest for a margin of safety and cause us to disagree with theories such as modern portfolio theory mpt which associate greater volatility with greater risk the third principle is matching liabilities with assets  you have goals with varying time horizons ranging from shortterm  such as tax payments to intermediate  such as college funding and long term  such as retirement funding  as we become aware of these differences we identify which of our investments may be appropriate for you  the nature of your commitments determine our investment selection   we believe these commitments or liabilities best define your asset allocation by comparing the required distribution or growth rates with the yields that various portfolio investments generate both historically and currently based on these principles we limit our investments to selecting opportunistically from money market accounts mma us government bonds usg us government treasury inflation protection securities tips and common stocks  we do not invest in commodities because our preference is to invest in an asset class that is productive and does not depend on price rise potential  we do not invest in nonus listed common stocks because we do not adequately understand foreign exchanges  each category of investments that we use has its respective merits  for goals which are shortterm we recommend mmas and usgs whereas for intermediate and longterm goals we recommend a combination of tips and common stocks  client communicationswe communicate with you through a quarterly letter which discusses the current investing environment our firms investment results and our thoughts  these quarterly letters are supplemented with telephone calls personal meetings and this website  by using the website we make available to you resources that allow timely access to comprehending our process if you have greater clarity about our investment process it is more likely that your emotions will not become an impediment to investment success  the internet also allows us
