should be used by individual investors critics question whether endowment model should be used by individual investors observers question using the approach for individual investors may     am by dan jamieson some industry observers are questioning whether an endowment model of investing — as popularized by the yale university endowment fund — should be used for individual investors the endowment model adds diversification to traditional stock and bond portfolios by including large doses of alternatives and real assets in recent years the approach has produced some eyepopping returns “theres been a noticeable move to include nontraditional assets in portfolios” of highnetworth investors said scott welch a senior managing director of fortigent llc in rockville md a platform provider for advisers at the same time mutual funds exchange traded funds and hedge fund replication products have lowered the “access point” to alternatives he said “three years ago you probably needed  million” to gain access to a broad portfolio of alternatives mr welch said “today you could probably build something close with  million” or less he said  zoom scott welch what blew up were the privateequity holdings but the democratization of the endowment model may be arriving just as the investment approach is blowing up yales endowment reportedly is looking at a  loss for its fiscal yearend in june meanwhile harvard universitys endowment might be down about  many college endowments are being forced to unload their privateequity and hedge fund stakes at discounts “what blew up were the privateequity holdings” mr welch said as of june yales endowment had  in private equity with another  in absolutereturn strategies and real assets it had just  in domestic equity harvard had  in private equity another  in timber agricultural land and real estate and only  in domestic equity “everybody copied yale” said andre perold a professor at harvard business school and founder of highvista strategies llc a boston firm with  billion under management for endowments and highnetworth individuals “somehow people thought being illiquid was no problem” he said during a presentation last week at a meeting of the denverbased investment management consultants association the crisis that endowment funds face was a major point of discussion among advisers at that meeting mr perold poked fun at his own school he showed an artists rendering of a proposed new harvard medicalresearch facility that has since been put on hold leaving a hole in the ground from the groundbreaking some observers are even questioning the huge returns posted by endowment funds prior to the meltdown yale in new haven conn boasted an annualized year return of  as of june  and harvard in cambridge mass had a return of  the standard  poors  stock index meanwhile returned  on an annualized basis according to morningstar inc of chicago some endowments might have assets priced at book value rather than market value said ron surz president of ppca inc a san clemente califbased consulting firm furthermore “some kind of stale pricing is smoothing hedge fund returns” said adam patti chief executive of indexiq of rye brook ny which offers hedge fund replication products “sometimes hedge funds are overestimating returns and underestimating volatility” he said citing his firms research into the correlation of monthly hedge fund results valuation is a challenge for privateequity holdings mr welch said “but i tend to believe the performance numbers” of the endowments because “they truly were invested with the top privateequity firms” but most individual investors dont get access to top privateequity firms and hedge funds that is why individuals shouldnt use alternatives mr perold said in an interview “the reason is its costly and they have no advantage in figuring out whos good and whos not” he said “all theyre doing is incurring costs and lockups” instead mr perold recommends that investors buy a world equity index and reduce risk with inflationprotected bonds using only lowcost liquid products mr welch disagrees “if you included longshort strategies and commoditytrading advisers in your portfolio then that helped you last year” he said most investors dont want alternative investments that arent transparent and arent liquid mr patti said his firms products use a transparent model and etfs to mimic hedge fund performance secret sauce  zoom “the days of the hedge fund with the secret sauce that cant tell you what it does are gone” mr welch said “thats not an acceptable response” matthew armistead president of camelback wealth management llc in phoenix pointed to the hussman strategic growth fund which uses a hedging strategy as an example of a registered product that advisers can use to replicate alternatives for smaller investors hussman econometrics advisors inc of ellicott city md manages the fund “i think advisers in general got complacent about risk over the last few years” said mr armistead whose twoyearold firm has about  million under management after last year though advisers are clearly in the mood for alternatives at one point during
