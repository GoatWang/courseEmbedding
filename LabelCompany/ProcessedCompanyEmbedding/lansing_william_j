everyone for joining us for our first quarter earnings call im pleased to say were off to a good start delivering solid growth across our portfolio in our first quarter we reported revenues of  million an increase of  over the same period last year we delivered  million of gaap net income and gaap earnings of  per share our gaap earnings and eps were positively affected by the adoption of a new accounting standard which mike will detail adjusting for that impact gaap net income and eps were both up  from last year we delivered  million of nongaap net income and nongaap eps of  per share both up  from the same period last year im pleased that were delivering growth throughout our business both our scores and decision management software segments were up  over the same period last year and application segment was up  over the same period last year were continuing to see positive signs in our cloud business where revenues were up  and bookings were up  versus last year in fact it was the second largest quarter ever for our cloud business and the pipeline for our solutions remains strong as we sign more deals and grow our customer base we are building a strong transactional revenue stream with recurring predictable revenues we are seeing more evidence every quarter for increased market acceptance of our decision management software bookings this quarter were up  over last year and represented the largest quarter ever in that segment the investments we have made in distribution over the last year are beginning to pay off and we expect solid growth in this space moving forward in the scores business we continue to make great strides towards maximizing the value of this cornerstone franchise its been two years since we announced the deal with experian to add fico scores to their premium consumer offerings the first year of that partnership was dedicated to rolling out scores across the experian platform we continued last year to fine tune the program and pursue other opportunities with experian that led to an agreement we signed this month to further expand our relationship this new agreement broadens the content we provide to experians premium consumer offerings it also includes licensing the fico score as a key component in experians direct lead generation business we believe in the value that this lead gen business can create for consumers and lenders by taking the friction out of the process by including fico scores the scores that are used by lenders to originate new loans this lead gen business can instantly match consumers with the best prequalified offers furthermore offering fico scores can produce higher response rates better conversion rates and increased consumer satisfaction were excited about the possibilities of this expanded partnership and were also pursuing several other meaningful opportunities in the score space in partnership with experian were offering consumers worldclass financial products in both the lead gen channel and the premium channel on the bb side were continuing to see positive results originations continue to be strong and were seeing account growth in account management scores as well in a rising rate environment its important to remember that our biggest point of leverage on the bb side is in credit cards which drives nearly twothirds of our bb scores revenue unlike other market participants we price mortgage scores at the same rate as other credit card scores because of this our exposure to mortgage is roughly only  of bb scores revenue so were less affected by mortgage market headwinds with the current momentum as well as visibilities into new revenue sources we expect scores growth to accelerate in the second half of the year ill share some summary thoughts later but now id like to turn the call back over to mike for further financial details michael j pung  fair isaac corp thanks will good afternoon everyone today ill emphasize three points in my comments first we delivered  million of revenue an increase of  million or  yearoveryear cloud revenue was  million up  from last year second we delivered  million of gaap net income which included the impact of adopting asu  the new accounting standard related to sharebased compensation finally we had  million of free cash flow this quarter and we used  million to repurchase shares ill begin by breaking the revenue down into our three reporting segments starting with applications revenues were  million up  versus the same period last year we also had a strong quarter in fraud solutions originations in our customer communication services product lines our application bookings of  million represented an increase of  from the prior year in the decision management software segment revenues were  million up  versus the prior year the increase this quarter was driven by services revenues in xpress optimization bookings were again strong in this segment at  million representing a  increase over the same period last year as will said it was the largest bookings quarter ever in this segment finally in our scores segment revenues were  million up  from the same period last year on the bb side were up  versus the same period a year ago and are continuing to see some positive trends the bc revenues were up a modest  from the same quarter last year but we expect that to accelerate in the back half of the year as the new opportunities will discussed go online looking at revenue by region this quarter  of total revenues were derived from the americas our emea region generated  and the remaining  was from asiapacific recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented  of total revenue consulting and implementation revenues were  of total and license revenues were  of total revenue bookings this quarter were  million up  from the prior year quarter we generated  million of current period revenues on those bookings for a yield of about  the weighted average term for our bookings was  months this quarter we continue to book more large deals this quarter we had  deals over  million versus  in the same period last year and we booked  deals over  million compared to a total of  all of last year we continue to drive strong bookings growth in our cloudbased products and built more backlog this quarter as our transactional bookings were up  over last year operating expenses totaled  million this quarter compared to  million in the fourth quarter the investments we are making in delivery support and infrastructure are proceeding as we discussed on our last call as you can see in our reg g schedule our nongaap operating margin was  for the first quarter we expect that operating margin to be between  to  for the full year gaap net income this quarter was  million and included a reduction to income tax expense of  million or  per share associated with the adoption of the accounting standard update  nongaap net income was  million for the quarter up  from the same quarter last year under the new accounting standard excess tax benefits or deficiencies generated upon the settlement or exercise of stock awards are no longer recognized as additional paid in capital but instead recognized as a reduction or increase to income tax expense estimating this item is difficult because its dependent upon our future stock price in relation to the fair value of our awards however the largest impact typically happens in our first fiscal quarter because our annual grant vests in december we expect the quarterly impact going forward to be much smaller over the remainder of the year as a result of this change the effective tax rate was negative  this quarter we expect the unaffected or normalized tax rate to be about  to  for the full year before any impact of the accounting standard the free cash flow for the quarter was  million which included the impact of the new accounting standard on a comparable basis free cash flow was  million in the prior year for the trailing  months reflecting this impact free cash flow was  million turning to the balance sheet we had  million of cash on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter our total debt is  million with a weighted average interest rate of  and our ratio of total net debt to adjusted ebitda this quarter is  times well below the covenant level of  times during the quarter we returned  million in excess cash to our investors repurchasing  shares at an average price of  we repurchased another  shares in january at an average price of  we have about  million remaining on the latest board authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of our cash we also continue to actively evaluate opportunities to acquire technologies and products that advance our strategy and strengthen our portfolio and competitive position finally we are updating our previously provided guidance to adjust for the first quarter impact of this new accounting standard we are not including any impact in the future quarters until they are known we are now guiding for the full fiscal year as follows revenues remain unchanged at approximately  million gaap net income previously guided at  million is now adjusted by this quarters excess tax benefit of  million to a new total of approximately  million gaap earnings per share is now approximately  nongaap net income remains unchanged at  million and nongaap eps is also unchanged at  per share with that ill turn it back over to will for a final comment william j lansing  fair isaac corp thanks mike as i said in my opening remarks i believe we are wellpositioned for success as we move into  and beyond our scores business has never been stronger and is now beginning to build market share on the consumer side to match the dominance we have had for decades among financial institutions and now were beginning to see the tangible impact of the investments we made in our software business we developed products weve invested in sales resources now were producing higher bookings and building a backlog of recurring transactional revenue were still working in getting our distribution up to speed as we train and deploy newly hired sales resources but were gaining momentum and were confident were on the right track ill turn the call back now to steve for qa steven p weber  fair isaac corp thanks will this concludes our prepared remarks and were ready now to take your questions sarah please open the line questionandanswer session operator your first question comes from the line of manav patnaik from barclays your line is open manav patnaik  barclays capital inc thank you good evening gentlemen the first question i had was in terms of your expanded agreements with experian and your commentary on bc growth should accelerate because of that could you help us maybe just understand the i guess the change in the scope of that agreement i know you said i guess it was mainly lead gen and does that include the discover i guess work that youre doing with those guys william j lansing  fair isaac corp there is really two pieces to the expansion one piece has to do with a broader use of fico scores with experians paid products and as you know there is more than one fico score and most of the experian premium products were wrapped around using a single fico score as opposed to a broader set of scores and the new agreement contemplates the broader use of fico scores so that consumers can get effectively a dashboard of multiple fico scores and have a more comprehensive view of their credit position so thats one part of it and weve given experian a great deal flexibility to construct the products in the way that they see is most valuable to consumers and so its an expanded flexibility that we have tried to drive here so that the consumer winds up with a better offering experian gets better offering and we obviously benefit for that the second part of it has to do with the lead gen piece and thats a business that we have contemplated for several years now as weve watched other players in the space build lead gen programs we have always believed that fico participation in a lead gen program would be more valuable to the lenders than the offerings by these other players because there is a lot less breakage and friction in going from a fico score for a prospect to an offer of credit and so working together with experian were now prepared to offer a lead gen offering to the market that uses a fico score as opposed to socalled education scores so thats really the second part of it manav patnaik  barclays capital inc okay and does that include the experian discover partnership or is that separate william j lansing  fair isaac corp thats separate manav patnaik  barclays capital inc okay so its an expanded experian and then the discover work you do okay and then i dont know maybe im reading too much but your commentary on evaluating ma options the technology and so forth is that just standard commentary or is there something in the pipeline that we should be looking out for william j lansing  fair isaac corp that is our standard commentary so we continue to love buying back our own stock and we set a very high bar for ma activity and at the same time were always on the prowl always looking for opportunities but as you know and as weve said many times the alternatives to investing in our own business are obviously being held to a pretty high standard because were so happy with our own prospects manav patnaik  barclays capital inc got it and then just last question from me any initial readthroughs or comments that are coming from your customers on the impacts from the new administration that you would want to point out william j lansing  fair isaac corp no i think it is a little early to say but the obvious elements have to do with if theres a reform in regulation that eases the burden on our bank customers theyre likely to benefit from that and if they do we will manav patnaik  barclays capital inc okay all right thanks a lot guys operator and your next question comes from the line of bill warmington from wells fargo your line is open william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc good evening everyone william j lansing  fair isaac corp hi bill william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc so congratulations on a strong quarter and especially on the strong bookings so i wanted to start out by asking about whats new on the affinity side thats an opportunity that you guys have talked about in the past and see if we could get an update there william j lansing  fair isaac corp yeah bill we are obviously in discussions with others about doing additional affinity programs and work those discussions are underway were not in a position to announce anything yet but i think that announcements are coming soon we feel pretty good about our prospects in the affinity space and i guess connected with that a little bit different from affinity but related is our activity in the paid education space where we have been exploring paid programs that go well beyond the free open access program and some of those are imminent as well william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc so this is â ive heard this referred to as open access plus sort of a hybrid between the traditional credit monitoring and the open access program is that the way to think of that william j lansing  fair isaac corp i think thats a way to think about it i think were careful to distinguish between two only because open access is a completely free program designed to let the consumer benefit from a score that the bank is already purchasing and so this program it does go above and beyond open access but we dont call it an open access program because its not a free program its a paid program its paid by the bank not by the consumer but is still a paid program william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc so discover had made some interesting comments on their call last week it sounded like theyre planning to increase their marketing investment to support an acceleration in the credit card loan growth from looks like they did about  growth in  and theyre talking about talking it up  to  in  the other comment they made was that about  of that loan growth is coming from newer card members so i wanted to ask how that was going insofar as you could talk about it and then also ask whether youre in active dialogue with other issuers to replicate that type of an offering william j lansing  fair isaac corp so we cant really comment on discover except to say that we have a program with them today that were very happy with and we continue to work on expanding it dont have anything to announce today but were obviously always looking to expand and broaden our partnership with them and do we have similar kinds of things in discussion with other players yes we do william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc yeah and then separately with experians right offer you had mentioned that goal of better matching consumers with a prequalified credit offer with the thought that that will produce a better response rate and better conversion rate for the lenders i guess my question is how is that going is the goal of the program actually being met is it actually resulting in better conversion and then how many lenders are working with it and what kind of a revenue model is it using because it sounds like it is a different model than the traditional per subscriber per month basis william j lansing  fair isaac corp okay so its early days to provide data so our views about the lower breakage for lenders and the higher utility for consumers that comes out using a fico score versus nonfico score we dont have data to present its more kind of a logic thing where we just believe that if you give a consumer a real fico score and thats the basis for making the decision once the credit offer is made there is going to be less breakage that seems like kind of basic but we dont have data to share there yet and then with respect to the revenue model it is a rev share kind of an arrangement i cant go into a lot of detail on it but basically we have completely aligned interest with experian on this and its a rev share model william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc got it and then a question on dms telco deal that you guys had announced this past may i think that had plan to go live in november and i wanted to ask how that have performed during the peak holiday season and then also ask about the next piece of that implementation on the marketing piece how that was looking and then ultimately how we should think about modeling the revenue for that william j lansing  fair isaac corp well so just to take those questions in order we have gone live weve gone live without a hitch we ran smoothly right through the holidays without any kind of outages or failures although ill say that we were tested i mean thats natural and this represents a pretty big volume and a big infrastructure play for us and so we had a lot of work to do to make sure that were up to snuff but we sailed through it and were happy with the results too early to talk about the marketing but were feeling pretty good about the way that entire operation have gone william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc got it and then one housekeeping question just on the bc growth how was the growth within the myfico piece of that michael j pung  fair isaac corp so this quarter bill yearoveryear we had  growth across all of bc and myfico was about midsingle digits and all the rest collectively was a little bit shy of that william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc got it thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of matthew galinko from sidoti your line is open matthew e galinko  sidoti  co llc hey good afternoon guys you called out strength in customer communications curious was there just a single large deal that was pushing on that or did you have number of deals and just generally whats your i guess outlook for that product william j lansing  fair isaac corp its across the board its not a single deal thats ratable revenue and so it kind of marches upwards smoothly at least we hope it does and it is now thats been a multiyear journey for us getting all of the offering on to a single code base getting the infrastructure in place globally so we can support customers around the globe leveraging aws to get to places that we dont have operations so its been a journey right now we feel like were hitting our stride we think we have the best offering in the market by a fairly right margin customers seem to believe that too and so its gone very smoothly but its not one single thing its kind of everything working together good execution across the board matthew e galinko  sidoti  co llc got it and if im not mistaken did you acquire that asset william j lansing  fair isaac corp we did it was matthew e galinko  sidoti  co llc so i think you had about  william j lansing  fair isaac corp i am sorry go ahead matthew e galinko  sidoti  co llc i was going to say i think you had when you made the acquisition it was somewhere around low double digit growth rate maybe around  to  and you talked a little bit about the size of the market for you there but can you talk a little bit about i know you said youre hitting your stride is there a substantial addressable market ahead of you on that and do you see that as being a product that can drive your software business over the next couple of years william j lansing  fair isaac corp yeah good question okay so just a bit of history the company was called adeptra we bought it a bit over four years ago it was a good growing company when we bought it it had reached some scale limits on the infrastructure on which it was operated i would say that we spent several years in a retrenchment mode and i dont think its just kind of postmerger integration blues i think we really had a lot of rework to do on the code base and on the infrastructure and so we really didnt have tremendous growth for several years in the middle i feel like were back onto a double digit growing kind of trajectory where is the growth coming from its multiple areas there is the growth that comes out of appending customer communication services to our existing franchises so that takes primarily two forms one is fraud where we have a very strong franchise and now we have an opportunity to talk directly to our customers customers about fraud alerts and is that really you and did you make this transaction and those kinds of things and then a second franchise where we have natural extension and have a lot of volume is in collections and recovery where our debt manager  products offering is naturally complimented by an ability to talk directly to our customers customer and of course there is a feedback loop there that improves the efficacy improves the outcome so those are kind of the more natural things for us where we build and extend from businesses were already in it does have the potential to open up doors in new areas like marketing and particularly since we now have this dms platform that allows our customers to use the same data from multiple data feeds but the same data to inform different kinds of activities whether its origination or line management or marketing solutions or customer communications we now can append this customer communication service to many other things so we anticipate the demand it will grow beyond even the two franchises were strong right now matthew e galinko  sidoti  co llc got it thanks and maybe a left field kind of question here but insofar as you have a lot of products that youre i think to some degree experimenting with or testing that arent necessarily core at this point but if you find kind of a noncore product that you think you could better monetize through divesting the product line i mean do you think about that at all or do you still feel that everything you have today is better taken to market under the fico umbrella william j lansing  fair isaac corp well thats a great question matthew i mean we have a fairly disciplined process here weve adopted ges ss strategy process where we review all of our businesses twice a year kind of midyear with a look to what the three year outlook looks like and we look at the competitive environment and the market and total addressable market and what the headwinds are how strong our product is and what its prospects looked like and we then we come back towards the end of the year where we tighten down and lock up the budget for the subsequent year and thats the s part of the ss process and in that we kind of have the buttoned up tactical next year plan in the course of that strategy work we always evaluate whether it makes sense for us to continue to be in the business whether the business would be more valuable in someone elses hands and whether were adequately resourcing some of our young not yet big and widely profitable businesses and of course thats a challenge for a company like ours because we have prospects that are really tremendous far more than we can effectively resource i think we recognize that we have this kind of feast of riches in analytics and we cant participate in all the great opportunities we have around us i would say that the businesses that were in we have the half dozen or so core franchises where were typically number one or number two in the business and if were not number one or number two we believe we have the industry leading product and there is only a couple of exceptions to that in our portfolio and where there is an exception were usually in it for a different reason or because we believe that there is an opportunity for us to improve it and so i would say that thats a long way of saying that were pretty happy with the portfolio there is nothing in the portfolio today that were prepared to divest or that were seriously contemplating divesting there are some growth opportunities that have to be managed carefully because we cant do everything wed like to do and so we have to pick our winners for example were putting a lot of investment into cyber right now thats a money losing business for fico because were pouring in resources and the revenue is not there yet we have every expectation that thats going to be a great business in several years and so we are resourcing it appropriately but of course thats going to crowd out some other opportunities and thats what it is doing and those are the hard decisions we have to make matthew e galinko  sidoti  co llc got it i appreciate that color and congrats on the quarter william j lansing  fair isaac corp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of brett huff from stephens your line is open blake anderson  stephens inc hey guys congrats on a nice quarter this is blake anderson on for brett in applications i know you briefly touched on your customer communications but can you size the license sales in fraud management solutions was there anything any outsized deals in fraud for to you call out william j lansing  fair isaac corp just one we had a scheduled license renewal in fraud that hit this quarter the scheduled renewal was quarter two and it got signed by end of december at the request of the customer beyond that it was kind of routine business in the numbers blake anderson  stephens inc okay thanks and then your gross margins were down just a little bit yearoveryear anything to call out there that was driving that william j lansing  fair isaac corp not really the mix of the margin is often dependent upon the mix of how much ratable and services business we have in comparison to license revenue and scores revenue the latter being higher margin the former being lower margin and we had a higher mix of services revenue because of some of the deals we booked last year beyond that nothing blake anderson  stephens inc okay and then for the margin guidance for the year are you still attributing that range primarily to your investments and delivering cloud infrastructure or is there anything thats kind of popped up in the q that might be driving that that we should pay attention to more throughout the rest of the year william j lansing  fair isaac corp no nothing changed from what we said in november when we set the guidance it really is tied to two things its tied to the additional investments we built into our budget that were making with respect to our infrastructure and our cloud thats number one and number two its tied to the ultimate mix of business we have between lower margin ratable and services business compared to the higher margin license and scores and thus the  basis point range but nothing has changed from november blake anderson  stephens inc all right and then lastly how does paying down debt kind of stack up in your uses of cash priorities i know you said share repo is number one i know you mentioned the comments on ma but how do you guys think about paying down debt william j lansing  fair isaac corp well so the current debt we have the blend is at about  so its pretty cheap debt more than half of it is in a revolver which is under  basis points and i guess we could pay that down but we think we have a better use of cash than paying down  debt on the other hand the rest of it is in term notes that have scheduled maturities and if we pay those off early we have a penalty a make whole penalty and as a result we have just simply let the maturities happen and we rolled them into the revolver so at least under the current kind of regulatory environment and tax environment what we have been doing is what we will continue to do until we reach a point where we think its sensible to refinance the entire debt structure and were a little a ways away from that probably a year away from that michael j pung  fair isaac corp we dont really think about it as a paying off debt i mean we like our leverage where it is in this  times to  times area and so to the extent that we have maturities we replace it with lower cost revolving debt and at some point we could reevaluate that equation but i wouldnt expect a very big difference in our leverage position going forward blake anderson  stephens inc thanks a lot operator your next question comes from the line of adam klauber from william blair your line is open adam klauber  william blair  co llc hi good afternoon and thanks when we look at the bookings could you give us a rough idea on the decision management how many of those came from sort of the existing core of financials versus newer verticals william j lansing  fair isaac corp yeah i dont have the exact numbers adam its probably this quarter more slightly weighed towards financial services than it is outside of financial services so of our total bookings i can tell you    were with our kind of core financial services business the remainder was outside as it relates to dms i just dont know that level of detail offhand adam klauber  william blair  co llc sure william j lansing  fair isaac corp its probably similar adam klauber  william blair  co llc okay thats helpful then just following up on the margin you know just on an absolute basis as you mentioned youve been investing in sales and delivery and expenses are up compared to year ago but its looks like theyre flattening out so is that a way for us to think about it are they at a better run rate today compared to a year ago but you wont see big jumps up over the rest of the year william j lansing  fair isaac corp yeah our current run rates are around  million plus or minus adam klauber  william blair  co llc yeah william j lansing  fair isaac corp you usually see a little bit of uptick in our second quarter the one were in right now simply because our annual salary increase happens in december and so you see the first full impact of  to  salary increase in our fiscal second quarter and then oddly enough you see a payroll tax reset most people have hit their payroll tax maximum by the end of the year and it gets reset january  so we see actually  million  million increase in that so that kind of will put the number up a little bit higher than  million but were kind of locked in in this range and are kind of managing our business at that level as we pursue a more topline growth adam klauber  william blair  co llc great and that sounds like more normalized growth going forward then sort of jumps weve seen over the last couple of quarters then william j lansing  fair isaac corp yeah adam klauber  william blair  co llc okay okay then as far as the experian obviously a great sign is that a couple of quarters that well see some of the impacts from those new agreements or can we see that more near term william j lansing  fair isaac corp i think a couple quarters is pretty near term but i think youll see it grow throughout the year its going to start smaller and ramp up michael j pung  fair isaac corp and remember its kind of tied to experians marketing budgets and marketing plans which are outside of our area of control and so it can vary the speed and pace at which the basically tied to their new fiscal year coming up here in april adam klauber  william blair  co llc right right okay and then as far as cyber you mentioned and obviously thats a longterm effort and its still very very early any chance well see even a little revenue this year or is that probably more of an  type occurrence michael j pung  fair isaac corp its really more than  occurrence although little bit of revenue trickling in there is a lot of interest there is a lot of interest there are lot of conversations going on weve got a little bit of business going weve got business going with our iboss partnership so things are coming along but its way premature to expect any kind of revenue in  could it be meaningful in  it will be visible it will be visible in  and meaningful in  adam klauber  william blair  co llc okay great thats great to hear thanks guys william j lansing  fair isaac corp thanks adam operator and there are no further questions in the queue at this time i will now turn the call back over to the presenters steven p weber  fair isaac corp thank you this concludes

call ill briefly summarize our financial results for the quarter and full fiscal year and then talk about the progress we made this fiscal year on our strategic initiatives finally ill discuss our outlook for  in our fourth quarter we reported revenues of  million the largest ever in company history and an increase of  over the same period last year we delivered  million of gaap net income and gaap earnings of  per share which included restructuring and tax adjustments which mike will walk through we delivered  million of nongaap net income up  from last year and nongaap eps of  per share an increase of  from the same period last year its another great finish to a fiscal year our full year revenue growth of  beat our guidance and adjusting for the restructuring and tax benefit we were within the guided range for net income and eps our applications business was up  for the quarter and  for the full year over last year we are encouraged by the reception for the cloudbased versions of our applications in fact our cloudbased products overall were up  in fiscal  much of which was due to growth in cloud applications our tools segment was down  versus the same quarter last year due to lighter license sales this quarter but was up  for the full year more importantly recurring revenue in our tools segment was up  in fiscal year  versus the prior year as more of this business is sold in the cloud we will see recurring revenues grow resulting in a more predictable business model finally our scores business was up  this quarter versus the prior year quarter and  for the full year versus the prior year much of this was on the consumer side where full year revenues were up  over the prior year but we also continue to see positive trends on the bb side as credit markets continue to thaw id like to take a step back and focus on a few of the initiatives weve been working on in fiscal year  and explain why im so excited about our prospects our decision management suite dms as we call it is set to build on the momentum of  we added  new customer logos during the year furthermore all existing decision management platform customers have contracted for additional projects resulting in repeat business from each and every customer hundreds of new opportunities have been added to the pipeline and we are winning a significant number of the deals additionally were winning in less than  days with an average of  per opportunity rate and pace that fortify the confidence we have in our dms strategy given the strength of our product portfolio our theme for  is to focus on expanding distribution which will contribute to accelerating growth well be adding more sales people to supplement those already added in  and our sales team under the strong leadership of wayne huyard is focused on execution and boosting productivity during  wayne built a strong leadership team that is now focusing on identifying key stakeholders buyers and influencers theyre zeroing in on places where our decisioning technology is most valuable and communicating ficos unique ability to provide that value supported by field marketing our sales team will target new logos and continue to expand the portion of our business coming from beyond financial services on the scores side we delivered strong growth in fiscal  and we have several more growth initiatives on the way we continued to make huge strides with our open access program just last month we announced that we had crossed a new milestone  million consumer accounts now have regular access to fico scores for free and well be adding many more in  this program has proven beneficial for both consumers and lenders lenders have reported that consumers viewing their fico score demonstrate higher engagement more visits to bank websites lower attrition lower delinquencies and higher fico scores in fact in a new report published by the federal reserve bank of philadelphias payments cards center based on data from the barclaycard participation some of those benefits were outlined  of enrolled cardholders check their fico scores every month credit card utilization by the riskiest cardholders generally declines after they enroll in the program and delinquency rates of the people enrolled in the program remain below those of their nonparticipating peers for up to nine months after enrollment while the program has raised consumer understanding and awareness of fico scores many consumers remain confused about the various credit scores provided to consumers by others a recent study found that a majority of consumers  who have received nonfico credit scores online believe they have in fact received actual fico scores further  think these nonfico credit scores are also widely used by lenders formulas used by others to create credit scores for the same consumers that are often significantly different from their fico scores sometimes  points or more consumers who know their actual fico scores have an accurate understanding of how lenders will evaluate them when they apply for a loan we will continue to work for consumer credit education and transparency overtime we expect that consumer awareness about fico scores will reduce confusion marketers selling nonfico credit scores will be unable to leave their customers with the impression that theyre receiving fico scores when they are not this transparency and brand awareness will also help us as we move forward to pursue other opportunities in the consumer space were currently pursuing innovative ways to further grow our business in the consumer space including through partners the affinity market is one weve spoken about in the past and we continue to expect to participate significantly in this market while we dont have any revenue expectations built into our  numbers due to uncertainties around timing we do expect to be making announcements in this space in the coming months we also announced this year a pilot of our new alternative data score called fico score xd this product is a great example of how we leverage our technology and expertise to support our banking clients by bringing new products to market this new fico score is focused on expanding access to credit not simply scoring more people weve created a way to provide a fico score for millions of additional consumers many of them credit worthy based on the results of the pilot program the new fico score xd can be a lifeline for millions of previously unscorable people validations of actual applications show better than expected results we can score nearly  of in the door applications we expect the fico score xd will be available for commercial use in fiscal  looking ahead to  we continue to invest in areas of our business where we see the greatest growth potential as we said last quarter  has been a year of significant product innovation and  will be a year where we expand our distribution to leverage that innovation obviously its not either or we will continue to build innovative products that said we see significant opportunities in the market today for expanding distribution for the products and capabilities available for their customers today as always were diligent in how we just deploy our strong cash flow we made one acquisition in fiscal  tonbeller which gave us critical riskbased financial crime prevention and compliance capabilities that we expect will be increasingly important to our clients and we continued our stock repurchases in fiscal  we repurchased  million shares and in the last five years weve repurchased nearly  million shares we are strong believers in our own prospects and view investing and repurchases as an excellence use for the cash we generate in short we are very excited about our future there may be bumps in the road as we continue to experience quarterly lumpiness due to uneven license sales and its difficult to determine the timing of revenues from many of our new initiatives but we are in a unique position in the marketplace on both the analytic side and the scores side we have products and capabilities that the world needs and those needs are growing its up to us to execute on our plans to serve those needs and expand our scope and im confident we have the team in place to succeed i will talk more about our outlook for  but first i will turn the call over to mike for further financial details michael j pung  chief financial officer executive vice president  investor relations thanks will good afternoon everyone today ill emphasize three points in my prepared comments first we delivered  million of revenue this quarter up  versus last year and a total of  million for the year up  from the prior year our fourth quarter included  million in license revenue second we delivered  million in net income this quarter which included restructuring expenses net of tax of  million and a reduction to tax expense of  million finally we delivered  million of free cash flow in the quarter which we used to pay down our revolver we repurchased  million shares during the year or  of our outstanding shares ill begin by breaking the revenue down into our three reporting segments starting with applications revenues were  million up  from last quarter and  from the same period last year the increase over the prior year was primarily driven by increases in customer communication solutions collections and recovery solutions and revenues from the tonbeller acquisition and included a large license renewal full year revenues for applications was  million up  from last year in the tools segment revenues were  million flat with last quarter and down  from the prior year the yearoveryear decline was due to fewer blaze and decision optimizer license sales this quarter full year tools revenue were  million up  from last year and finally in our scores segment revenues were  million up  from last quarter and  from the same period last year bb was up  over the prior period driven by strong originations and bc revenues were up  from the same quarter last year for the full year scores revenues were  million up  from last year looking at our revenues by region this quarter  of total revenues were derived from our americas region our emea region generated  and the remaining  was from asia pacific recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented  of total revenue consulting and implementation revenues were  of total and license revenues were  of total revenue we generated  million of current period revenue on bookings of  million a  yield the weighted average term for our bookings was  months this quarter for the full year bookings were  million down  from the prior year our operating expenses totaled  million this quarter up  million from the prior quarter this quarter included a  million restructuring charge which was driven primarily from the writedown of several facilities as well as the reduction of some head count that will be redeployed to distribution roles as you can see in our reg g schedule nongaap operating margin was  for the quarter and  for the year we expect that nongaap operating margin will be between  to  in  gaap net income this quarter was  million down  from the prior year due to this quarters restructuring charge of  million which is net of tax or  per share in addition we had a positive tax adjustment of  million or  per share our nongaap net income was  million for the quarter up  from the same quarter last year the effective tax rate for the full year was  below our previous guidance due to the favorable tax resolution of a state tax audit and an increase in earnings in lower tax jurisdictions we expect the effective tax rate to be between  to  for the full year of fiscal  free cash flow for the quarter was  million compared to  million in the prior year for the full year free cash flow was  million compared to  million in the prior year moving on to the balance sheet we had  million in cash at the end of the quarter which is up  million from last quarter due to the cash we generated from operations partially offset by the payments on the revolver our total debt is  million with a weighted average interest rate of  the ratio of our total net debt to adjusted ebitda is  times below the covenant level of  times we did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter but we bought back  shares in october at an average price of  in fiscal  we repurchased a total of  million shares at an average price of  for a total of  million we still have  million remaining on the latest board authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash we also continue to actively evaluate opportunities to acquire relevant technologies and products that advance our strategy or strengthen our portfolio and competitive position with that ill turn it back over to will for his thoughts on  william j lansing  president chief executive officer  director thanks mike as i said in my opening remarks  was a pivotal year for us we made significant strides in improving our products and capabilities and expanding the delivery options our applications are now available to customers to either run on premise or access from the cloud and we now offer customers through our decision management suite an easy way to evaluate customize deploy and scale stateoftheart analytics and decision management solutions finally we found new ways to leverage our scores assets and well continue to expand usage of the industry standard fico score among consumers weve laid the foundation and are confident we have multiple paths to grow in our future the difficulty is predicting the timing of these initiatives in the nearterm we do still face some uncertainty in the marketplace many of our financial services customers are working in a difficult interest rate and regulatory environment and in some cases its effecting our sales cycle and lower bookings in  caused some headwind as we head into  with all this in mind were providing the following guidance for fiscal  were guiding revenues between  million and  million an increase of about  to  versus fiscal  were guiding gaap net income between  million and  million gaap earnings per share between  and  nongaap net income between  million and  million and nongaap earnings per share of  to  the eps guidance assumes current share counts although as mike said we continue to view repurchases as an attractive use of our cash ill now turn the call back to steve for qa steven p weber  treasurer vp  investor relations officer thanks will this concludes our prepared remarks and were ready now to take your questions courtney please open the line questionandanswer session operator and our first question comes from bill warmington william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc good evening everyone michael j pung  chief financial officer executive vice president  investor relations hey bill william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc congratulations on a strong finish to the year michael j pung  chief financial officer executive vice president  investor relations thank you william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc so i wanted to start off by asking about the build out of the sales force for this past year and next year if you could just talk a little bit about how many sales people were actually added in  how many you plan to add in  william j lansing  president chief executive officer  director yeah bill ill give you the actual numbers so we started to shift internal dollars that we were spending primarily in development into our distribution channels in around the third and the fourth quarter so for the last quarter and a half we probably added about  people and onboarded  sales people and in the meantime we have reduced our head count in other areas by just over  we expect between now and the next month or two to probably add at least another  to  people in the sales capacity and allin were expecting to bring our sales team up by roughly  people most of which are hired from the outside but some we actually have redeployed from areas like product management into our sales force so to some degree we are reshifting already existing spend as opposed to adding new spend to the organization william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc okay and then if you could talk about the â you mentioned the affinity market being a source of potential opportunity for you could you talk a little bit about the pipeline that you see in terms of the number of transactions that youre considering participating in what types of industries theyre in and then maybe even talk about what such a potential deal might look like william j lansing  president chief executive officer  director well so we have a â were in conversations with probably half a dozen potential affinity customers and were looking at it in a couple of ways one is directly where we would be for lack of a better word the general contractor and also in other situations where we provide the fico score to a partner participating in that space who would serve the bank or the retailer or whoever it is providing the affinity services to their customers and that is kind of the range its it is very typically banks its retailers its anyone who has a large customer base that are good candidates for credit report monitoring services in terms of the timing these things take a long time to negotiate and they take quite awhile also measured in quite a few months to turn on to implement and turn on and so although we have conversations that are quite far along right now its not clear that the revenue will flow in  well just have to see how that plays out william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc got it and then i wanted to ask the top line guidance it looks like its about roughly  to  times if you could talk a little bit about the growth assumptions within each of the three segments applications scores and tools william j lansing  president chief executive officer  director sure i think that we expect continued growth in scores strong growth in scores we expect continued strong growth in tools although as some of that shifts to cloud and recurring revenue it may not appear quite as strong in the revenue as it has historically when it was license sales so we are a seeing a shift from tools being predominantly license to being more of a mix with saas and our dms offering and then applications is clearly the slowest growing of our major business segments i do think its probably worth pausing on this for a moment and talking a little bit more about the relationship between tools and applications the fact is that the ip that underlies our applications and the ip that underlies our tools is the same ip and we solve the same kinds of problems whether its originations or questions on a recovery or any other kind of decisioning and at some level the way weve gotten to where we are is tools were a more flexible and a more custom solution and when there were enough customers who had the same kind of a problem we would build an application which was kind of a somewhat standardized solution for a group of customers sharing the same kind of a problem and so the distinction between tools and applications is a little bit of a fuzzy one because you can use either tools or applications to address the same problem what were seeing today is much more fuzziness between the two our sales people are not compensated to sell one over the other we are really focused on selling the right solution to the customer whatever that may be and as tools have become more easy to use as our dms suite has developed more functionality more features its become more of an alternative to some of our applications and i think what were seeing is in certain situations customers opt for a tools solution where they might previously have opted for an applications solution so this is a case of some amount of cannibalization of our applications business by our tools business and its not a bad thing you have to look at it holistically and look at the two on a combined basis to have an accurate picture of how our business is doing william a warmington  wells fargo securities llc got it thank you very much operator okay and your next question comes from manav patnaik manav shiv patnaik  barclays capital inc yeah good evening guys so just on the revenue growth and i guess the margins were still in this low singledigit range in revenue growth margins still look like theyll be flattish and i guess youve talked about your longterm targets for quite some time now to do well beyond that so i was just wondering in the context of that like when is that breakout year in your view where we start getting close to those ambitions william j lansing  president chief executive officer  director manav i think that is a very fair question and i think that  is on our way to a breakout year in  i think that the only reason you see the caution that you see today is we really do have uncertainty about when some of the stuff hits but i dont think its three to five years out i think its in the next couple of years and so what doesnt happen towards the end of  i think we will start to see happening in  we fully expect that  will be a year of stronger revenue growth and expanding margins manav shiv patnaik  barclays capital inc okay and then in the context of this quarter probably being the first full quarter ramp of the experian deal we were hoping you guys could provide a little bit more color on what the bakedin assumptions are for scores and maybe that segment in  to try and sort of gauge what the moving parts really are william j lansing  president chief executive officer  director yeah so manav embedded in the guidance that we provided for scores is highsingle digit growth and what we did not try to bake in to the guidance for scores is any incremental revenue that would run through the experian channel as we have it today the directtoconsumer channel beyond the run rate that we are starting the year with there are other opportunities and other products that could get added along the way if experian chooses to do that and if the customer demand exists for it and that could provide something beyond what we have built in to our guidance and as will mentioned in his comments the affinity programs and any revenue that could come through a partner like experian or directly through the customer has not been built into any of the guidance as it also is quite uncertain as to when a customer is ready to launch a program like that i guess id lastly say that we also very purposefully have left to the side the alternative score xd and not included any of that in our plan for fiscal  though from the latest feedback weve gotten from the test group there is certainly is a high degree of interest to bring that into their credit risk management processes and those things also take a little bit of time and so in order to be prudent we thought we would hold that off to the side and see that how that plays out so we think there is some upside opportunities along the way in our scores business that provide some of the tailwind if you will that may offset some of the headwind we saw this year in our software businesses and the late bookings manav shiv patnaik  barclays capital inc okay and then just one more from me so just on the tools side obviously historically youve shown it and youve always guided to sort of low doubledigit growth it seems like i guess momentum didnt carry on in the last quarter here but should we still see low doubledigit in  william j lansing  president chief executive officer  director yeah inherent in our guidance is much higher growth in tools along with high singledigit in scores and then relatively low singledigit in the biggest part of our business applications manav shiv patnaik  barclays capital inc and on that applications would it be fair to say that if its conservative its because you just dont know when those license deals hit william j lansing  president chief executive officer  director thats very true with applications we also have some tough comps in the fraud area where the last two years weve had some pretty large fraud revenue quarters because of the timing of license revenue and so with that being harder to predict  we think you blend it all together and this is a reasonable range to operate from and set our cost structure around manav shiv patnaik  barclays capital inc got it all right thanks guys operator the next question comes from brett huff brett huff  stephens inc good afternoon thanks for taking my question one thing that looked really good in the quarter was the bookings they really turned around is that just a typical seasonality or was there some things in the works that finally came through or is there any color there that you can give us and then may be anything any thoughts as you move into  william j lansing  president chief executive officer  director yeah there was no real seasonality in it it was more some things that have been in the works for a while that finally came through the bright spot embedded within the bookings numbers the  million of bookings is that a larger percentage of those bookings than weve seen in recent quarters relates to transactional volume revenue and so thats part of the recurring revenue stream that once they go live well start seeing that revenue quarterafterquarter theres a less of beginning an end point if you will like there is in license and services so not only was it a larger number i would say from my perspective the quality of those bookings were better than weve seen certainly over the last few quarters brett huff  stephens inc thats helpful and then on the affinity you were talking about i just want to make sure did you â have you signed any of the affinity programs to the new fico scores either directly or through partners or are these the ones that are still in discussion william j lansing  president chief executive officer  director no these are still in discussion brett huff  stephens inc okay and then last question from me is given the success of the experian reseller agreement or partnership how do we feel about the other credit bureaus or even other ways to distribute that that fico score not the open access but through another similar credit bureau or other similar partner william j lansing  president chief executive officer  director you know we continue to look for other ways to take the fico score to market im not in a position to comment on the specifics of our discussions with credit bureaus with the other credit bureaus but were always interested in expanding the use of fico scores brett huff  stephens inc okay thats exactly and thank you for your help operator there are no further questions at this time william j lansing  president chief executive officer  director thank you this concludes todays call thank
