was the bandmaster and taught music privately to supplement his income young sullivan became proficient with many of the instruments in the band and had composed an anthem by the waters of babylon by the age of eight he later recalled i was intensely interested in all that the band did and learned to play every wind instrument with which i formed not merely a passing acquaintance but a real lifelong intimate friendship i gradually learned the peculiarities of each  what it could do and what it was unable to do i learned in the best possible way how to write for an orchestra while recognising the boys obvious musical talent his father knew the insecurity of a musical career and discouraged him from pursuing it while studying at a private school in bayswater sullivan then aged  persuaded his parents and the headmaster to allow him to apply for membership in the choir of the chapel royal despite concerns that sullivan at nearly  years of age was too old to give much service as a treble before his voice broke he was accepted and soon became a soloist and by  was promoted to first boy even at this age sullivans health was delicate and he was easily fatigued sullivan flourished under the training of the reverend thomas helmore master of the choristers and began to compose anthems and songs helmore encouraged the young sullivans composing talent and arranged for one of his pieces o israel to be published in  sullivans first published work helmore also enlisted sullivans assistance in creating harmonisations for a volume of the hymnal noted and arranged for

academy sullivan continued to sing solos with the chapel royal which provided a small amount of spending money sullivans scholarship was extended to a second year and in  in what the biographer arthur jacobs calls an extraordinary gesture of confidence the scholarship committee extended his grant for a third year so that he could study in germany at the leipzig conservatoire while there sullivan studied composition with julius rietz and carl reinecke counterpoint with moritz hauptmann and ernst richter and the piano with louis plaidy and ignaz moscheles he was trained in mendelssohns ideas and techniques but was also exposed to a variety of musical styles including schubert verdi bach and wagner visiting a synagoguen  he was so struck by some of the cadences and progressions of the music that thirty years later he could recall them for use in his serious opera ivanhoe though the scholarship was extended to permit sullivan to spend one year in leipzig he stayed for three years there he became friendly with the impresario carl rosa and the violinist joseph joachim for his last year at leipzig his father scraped together the money for living expenses and the conservatoire

interspersed with hymns parlour songs and other light pieces in a more commercial vein his compositions were not enough to support him financially and from  to  he supplemented his income by working as a church organist which he enjoyed and as a music teacher sometimes at the crystal palace school which he hated and gave up as soon as he couldn  sullivan had an early chance to compose several

travelled with george grove to vienna in search of neglected manuscript scores by schubert they found and copied several and were particularly excited about their final discovery the score to rosamunden  sullivans first attempt at opera the sapphire necklace – to a libretto by henry f chorley was not produced and is now lost except for the overture and two songs from the work which were separately published his first surviving opera cox and box  was written for a private performance it then received charity performances in london and manchester and was later produced at the gallery

of a series of suites of incidental music for west end productions of shakespeare playsn  still in  sullivan composed a dramatic cantata on shore and sea for the opening of the london international exhibition and the hymn onward christian soldiers with words by sabine baringgould the salvation army adopted the latter as its favoured processional and it became sullivans most enduring hymn at the end of  the impresario john hollingshead commissioned sullivan to work with w s gilbert to create the burlesquestyle comic opera thespis for the gaiety theatren  played as a christmas entertainment it ran through to easter  a good run for such a piecen  after thespis gilbert and sullivan went their separate ways until they collaborated on three parlour ballads in late  and early  sullivans largescale works of the early s were the festival te deum crystal palace  and the oratorio the light of the world birmingham festival  he provided suites of incidental music for productions of the merry wives of windsor at the gaiety in  and henry viii at the theatre royal manchester in  he continued to compose hymns throughout the decaden  in  sullivan contributed songs to burnands christmas drawing room extravaganza the miller and his man in  the manager of the royalty theatre richard doyly carte needed a short piece to fill out a bill with offenbachs la périchole carte had conducted sullivans cox and boxn  remembering that gilbert had suggested a libretto to him carte reunited gilbert and sullivan and the result was the oneact comic opera trial by juryn  trial starring sullivans brother fred as the learned judge became a surprise hit earning glowing praise from the critics and playing for  performances over its first few seasons the daily telegraph commented that the piece illustrated the composers great capacity for dramatic writing of the lighter class and other reviews emphasised the felicitous combination of gilberts words and sullivans music one wrote it seems as in the great wagnerian operas as though poem and music had proceeded simultaneously from one and the same brain soon after the opening of trial sullivan wrote the zoo another oneact comic opera with a libretto by b c stephenson but the latter work had only a few short runs and for the next  years sullivans sole operatic collaborator was gilbert the two created an additional  operas together the lost chord  recording of the lost chord  by arthur sullivan and adelaide anne procter sung by reed miller problems playing this file see media help sullivan also turned out more than  popular songs and parlour ballads most of them written before the end of the s his first popular song was orpheus with his lute  and a wellreceived part song was oh hush thee my babie  the best known of his songs is the lost chord  lyrics by adelaide anne procter written in sorrow at the death of his brother frederic the sheet music for his best received songs sold in large numbers and were an important part of his income many of them were adapted as dance pieces in this decade sullivans conducting appointments included the glasgow choral union concerts – and the royal aquarium london  in addition to his appointment as professor of composition at the royal academy of music of which he was a fellow he was appointed as the first principal of the national training school for music in  he accepted the latter post reluctantly fearing that discharging the duties thoroughly would leave too little time for composing in this he was correct as his successor hubert parry also discovered sullivan was not effective in the post and he resigned in n  sullivans next collaboration with gilbert the sorcerer  ran for  performances a success by the standards of the day but hms pinafore  which followed it turned gilbert and sullivan into an international phenomenon the bright and cheerful music of pinafore was composed during a time when sullivan suffered from excruciating pain from a kidney stone pinafore ran for  performances in london the thensecondlongest theatrical run in history and more than  unauthorised productions were quickly mounted in america alonen  among other favourable reviews the times noted that the opera was an early attempt at the establishment of a national musical stage  free from risqué french improprieties and without the aid of italian and german musical models the times and several of the other papers agreed however that while the piece was entertaining sullivan was capable of higher art and frivolous light opera would hold him back this criticism would follow sullivan throughout his career in  sullivan suggested to a reporter from the new york times the secret of his success with gilbert his ideas are as suggestive for music as they are quaint and laughable his numbers  always give me musical ideas pinafore was followed by the pirates of penzance in  another international success which opened in new york and then ran in london for  performances early sedit scenes from the premiere of the golden legend at the leeds music festival  in  sullivan was appointed director of the triennial leeds music festival for his first festival he was commissioned to write a sacred choral work he chose henry hart milmans  dramatic poem based on the life and death of saint margaret the virgin for its basis gilbert adapted the libretto for sullivan the martyr of antioch premiered in october  sullivan was not a showy conductor and some thought him dull and old fashioned on the podiumn  but his composition had an enthusiastic reception and was frequently revived a grateful sullivan presented his collaborator with an engraved silver cup inscribed ws gilbert from his friend arthur sullivann  after the run of the pirates of penzance carte opened the next gilbert and sullivan piece patience in april  at londons opera comique where their past three operas had played in october patience transferred to the new larger stateoftheart savoy theatre built with the profits of the previous gilbert and sullivan works the rest of the partnerships collaborations were produced at the savoy as a result of which they are widely known as the savoy operas iolanthe  gilbert and sullivans fourth hit in a row was the first of the operas to premiere at the new theatre sullivan despite the financial security of writing for the savoy increasingly viewed his work with gilbert as unimportant beneath his skills and also repetitious after iolanthe sullivan had not intended to write a new work with gilbert but he suffered a serious financial loss when his broker went bankrupt in november  therefore he concluded that his financial needs required him to continue writing savoy operas in february  he and gilbert signed a fiveyear agreement with carte requiring them to produce a new comic opera on six months notice on  may  sullivan was knighted by queen victoria for his services  rendered to the promotion of the art of music in britain the musical establishment and many critics believed that this should put an end to his career as a composer of comic opera – that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera having just signed the fiveyear agreement sullivan suddenly felt trapped in middecember he bade farewell to his sisterinlaw charlotte freds widow who emigrated with her young family to america sullivans oldest nephew herbert stayed behind in england as his uncles ward the next opera princess ida  the duos only threeact blank verse work had a noticeably shorter run than its four predecessors although sullivans score was praised with box office receipts lagging in march  carte gave the six months notice under the partnership contract requiring a new opera sullivans close friend the composer frederic clay had suffered a serious stroke in early december  that effectively ended his career at the age of  sullivan reflecting on this on his own longstanding kidney problems and on his desire to devote himself to more serious music replied to carte it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by gilbert and myself programme for the mikado  gilbert had already started work on a new opera involving a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge the composer wrote on  april  that he had come to the end of my tether with the operas i have been continually keeping down the music in order that not one syllable should be lost  i should like to set a story of human interest  probability where the humorous words would come in a humorous not serious situation  where if the situation were a tender or dramatic one the words would be of similar character in a lengthy exchange of correspondence sullivan pronounced gilberts plot sketch particularly the lozenge element unacceptably mechanical and too similar in both its grotesque elements of topsyturveydom and in actual plot to their earlier work especially the sorcerern  and repeatedly requested that gilbert find a new subject the impasse was finally resolved on  may when gilbert proposed a plot that did not depend on any supernatural device the result was gilbert and sullivans most successful work the mikado  the piece ran for  performances which was the secondlongest run for any work of musical theatre and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece up to that timen  later sedit portrait by millais  in the national portrait gallery london it hangs next to frank holls  portrait of gilbert in  sullivan composed his second and last largescale choral work of the decade it was a cantata for the leeds festival the golden legend based on longfellows poem of the same name apart from the comic operas this proved to be sullivans best received fulllength work it was given hundreds of performances during his lifetime and at one point he declared a moratorium on its presentation fearing that it would become overexposed only handels messiah was performed more often in britain in the s and s it remained in the repertory until about the s but since then it has been seldom performed although it received its first professional recording in  the musical scholar and conductor david russell hulme writes that the work influenced elgar and waltonn  ruddigore followed the mikado at the savoy in  it was profitable but its ninemonth run was disappointing compared with most of the earlier savoy operas for their next piece gilbert submitted another version of the magic lozenge plot sullivan immediately rejected it gilbert finally proposed a comparatively serious opera to which sullivan agreed although it was not a grand opera the yeomen of the guard  provided him with the opportunity to compose his most ambitious stage work to date as early as  sullivan had been under pressure from the musical establishment to write a grand opera in  he told an interviewer the opera of the future is a compromise among the french german and italian schools – a sort of eclectic school a selection of the merits of each one i myself will make an attempt to produce a grand opera of this new school  yes it will be an historical work and it is the dream of my life after the yeomen of the guard opened sullivan turned once again to shakespeare composing incidental music for henry irvings production of macbeth  sullivan wished to produce further serious works with gilbert he had collaborated with no other librettist since  but gilbert felt that the reaction to the yeomen of the guard had not been so convincing as to warrant us in assuming that the public want something more earnest still he proposed instead that sullivan should go ahead with his plan to write a grand opera but should continue also to compose comic works for the savoyn  sullivan was not immediately persuaded he replied i have lost the liking for writing comic opera and entertain very grave doubts as to my power of doing itn  nevertheless sullivan soon commissioned a grand opera libretto from julian sturgis who was recommended by gilbert while suggesting to gilbert that he revive an old idea for an opera set in colourful venice the comic opera was completed first the gondoliers  was a piece described by gervase hughes as a pinnacle of sullivans achievement it was the last great gilbert and sullivan success sedit ivanhoe  the relationship between gilbert and sullivan suffered its most serious breach in april  during the run of the gondoliers when gilbert objected to cartes financial accounts for the production including a charge to the partnership for the cost of new carpeting for the savoy theatre lobby gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to carte alone carte was building a new theatre to present sullivans forthcoming grand opera and sullivan sided with carte going so far as to testify erroneously as to certain old debts gilbert took legal action against carte and sullivan and vowed to write no more for the savoy and so the partnership came to an acrimonious end sullivan wrote to gilbert in september  that he was physically and mentally ill over this wretched business i have not yet got over the shock of seeing our names coupled  in hostile antagonism over a few miserable pounds sullivans only grand opera ivanhoe based on walter scotts novel opened at cartes new royal english opera house on  january  sullivan completed the score too late to meet cartes planned production date and costs mounted sullivan was required to pay carte a contractual penalty of £ for his delay the production lasted for  consecutive performances an unprecedented run for a serious opera and earned good notices for its music afterwards carte was unable to fill the new opera house with other opera productions however and ivanhoe was blamed for the failure of the opera house the opera passed into obscurity after a touring revival in – the episode was as the critic herman klein observed the strangest comingling of success and failure ever chronicled in the history of british lyric enterprise sullivan did not seriously consider writing grand opera again later in  sullivan composed music for tennysons the foresters which ran well at dalys theatre in new york in  but failed in london the following yearn  poster for the chieftain  sullivan returned to comic opera but because of the fracture with gilbert he and carte sought other collaborators sullivans next piece was haddon hall  with a libretto by sydney grundy based loosely on the historical elopement of dorothy vernon with john manners although still comic the tone and style of the work was considerably more serious and romantic than most of the operas with gilbert it enjoyed a modest popularity running for  performances and earned critical praise in  sullivan once more provided incidental music for the lyceum this time for j comyns carrs king arthur the partnership with gilbert had been so profitable that carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer eventually succeeding with the help of tom chappell their music publisher their next opera utopia limited  ran for  performances barely covering the expenses of the lavish production although it was the longest run at the savoy in the s sullivan came to disapprove of the leading lady nancy mcintosh and refused to write another piece featuring her while gilbert insisted that she must appear in his next opera instead sullivan teamed up again with his old partner f c burnand the chieftain  a heavily revised version of their earlier twoact opera the contrabandista flopped gilbert and sullivan reunited one more time after mcintosh announced her retirement from the stage for the grand duke  this also failed and sullivan never worked with gilbert again although their operas continued to be revived with success at the savoy in may  sullivans fulllength ballet victoria and merrie england opened at the alhambra theatre to celebrate the queens diamond jubilee the works seven scenes celebrate english history and culture with the victorian period as the grand finale its sixmonth run was considered a great achievement the beauty stone  with a libretto by arthur wing pinero and j comyns carr was based on mediaeval morality plays the collaboration did not go particularly well sullivan wrote that pinero and comyns carr were gifted and brilliant men with no experience in writing for music and when he asked for alterations to improve the structure they refused sullivans score moreover was too serious for the savoy audiences tastes the opera was a critical failure and did not attract a following running for only seven weeks in  to benefit the wives and children of soldiers and sailors on active service in the boer war sullivan composed the music of a jingoistic song the absentminded beggar to a text by rudyard kipling which became an instant sensation and raised an unprecedented £ from performances and the sale of sheet music and related merchandise in the rose of persia  sullivan returned to his comic roots writing to a libretto by basil hood that combined an exotic arabian nights setting with plot elements of the mikado sullivans tuneful score was well received and the opera proved to be his most successful fulllength collaboration apart from those with gilbert another opera with hood the emerald isle quickly went into preparation but sullivan died before it could be completed death honours and legacyedit further information cultural influence of gilbert and sullivan memorial to sullivan victoria embankment gardens london having suffered from longstanding recurrent kidney disease that made it necessary from the s for him to conduct sitting down sullivan died of heart failure

the end of the boer war was performed posthumously a monument in the composers memory featuring a weeping muse was erected in the victoria embankment gardens in london and is inscribed with gilberts words from the yeomen of the guard is life a boon if so it must befall that death wheneer he call must call too soon sullivan wished to be buried in brompton cemetery with his parents and brother but

cambridge  and oxford  chevalier légion dhonneur france  the order of the medjidieh conferred by the sultan of turkey  and appointment as a member of the fourth class of the royal victorian order mvo in  in all sullivans artistic output included  operas  major orchestral works eight choral works and oratorios two ballets one song cycle incidental music to several plays numerous hymns and other church pieces and a large body of songs parlour ballads part songs carols and piano and chamber pieces sullivans operas have often been adapted first in the th century as dance pieces and in foreign adaptations of the operas themselves since then his music has been made into ballets pineapple poll  and pirates of penzance  the ballet  and musicals the swing mikado  the hot mikado  and hot mikado  hollywood pinafore  the black mikado  etc his operas are not only frequently performed but also frequently parodied pastiched quoted and imitated in comedy routines advertising law film television and other popular media his legacy apart from writing the savoy operas and his other works is felt perhaps most strongly today through his influence on the american and british musical theatre the innovations in content and form of the works that he and gilbert developed directly influenced the development of the modern musical throughout the th century in addition biographies and scholarly articles and analyses continue to be written about sullivans life and work personal lifeedit romantic lifeedit fanny ronalds sullivan never married but he had serious love affairs with several womenn  the first was with rachel scott russell – the daughter of the engineer john scott russell sullivan was a frequent visitor at the scott russell home in the mids and by  the affair was in full bloom rachels parents did not approve of a possible union with a young composer with uncertain financial prospects but the two continued to see each other covertly at some point in  sullivan started a simultaneous and secret affair with rachels sister louise – both relationships had ceased by early  sullivans longest love affair was with the american socialite fanny ronalds a woman three years his senior who had two children he met her in paris around  and the affair began in earnest soon after she moved to london permanently in  a contemporary account described fanny ronalds this way her face was perfectly divine in its loveliness her features small and exquisitely regular her hair was a dark shade of brown – châtain foncé deep chestnut – and very abundant  a lovely woman with the most generous smile one could possibly imagine and the most beautiful teeth sullivan called her the best amateur singer in london she often performed sullivans songs at her famous sunday soirees she became particularly associated with the lost chord singing it both in private and in public often with sullivan accompanying her when sullivan died he left her the autograph manuscript of that song along with other bequests ronalds was separated from her american husband but they never divorced social conventions of the time compelled sullivan and ronalds to keep their relationship private in his diary he would refer to her as mrs ronalds when he saw her in a public setting but l w for little woman or d h possibly dear heart when they were alone together often with a number in parentheses indicating the number of sexual acts completed ronalds was apparently pregnant on at least two occasions and procured abortions in  and  sullivan had a roving eye and his diary records the occasional quarrel when ronalds discovered his other liaisons but he always returned to hern  she was a constant companion up to the time of sullivans death but around  or  the sexual relationship seems to have ended he started to refer to her in the diary as auntie and the tick marks indicating sexual activity were no longer there although similar notation continued to be used for his relationships with other women who have not been identified and who were always referred to by their initials in  the yearold sullivan proposed marriage to the yearold violet beddington – but she refused him leisure and family lifeedit sullivan and his nephew herbert bertie sullivan loved to spend time in france both in paris and the south of france where his acquaintances included european royalty and where the casinos enabled him to indulge his passion for gambling he enjoyed hosting private dinners and entertainments at his home often featuring famous singers and wellknown actors in  he was initiated into freemasonry and was grand organist of the united grand lodge of england in  during queen victorias golden jubilee sullivans talent and native charm gained him the friendship of many not only in the musical establishment such as grove chorley and herman klein but also in society circles such as alfred duke of edinburgh sullivan enjoyed playing tennis although according to george grossmith i have seen some bad lawntennis players in my time but i never saw anyone so bad as arthur sullivan sullivan was devoted to his parents particularly his mother with whom he corresponded regularly when away from london until her death in  henry lytton wrote i believe there was never a more affectionate tie than that which existed between sullivan and his mother a very witty old lady and one who took an exceptional pride in her sons accomplishments sullivan was also very fond of his brother fred whose acting career he assisted whenever possiblen  and of freds children when fred died at the age of  he left his pregnant wife charlotte with seven children under the age of  after freds death arthur visited the family often and became guardian to all of the children in late  charlotte and six of her children emigrated to los angeles california leaving the oldest boy bertie in sullivans sole care despite his reservations about the move to america sullivan paid all the costs and gave substantial financial support to the family only a year later in january  charlotte died leaving the six children to be raised mostly by her brother and the older girls from june to august  after the mikado premiered sullivan visited the family in los angeles and took them on a sightseeing trip of the american west throughout the rest of his life and in his will he contributed financially to freds children continuing to correspond with them and to be concerned with their education marriages and financial affairs bertie stayed with his uncle arthur for the rest of the composers life three of sullivans cousins the daughters of his uncle john thomas sullivan performed with doyly carte rose jane jennie and kate sullivan the first two of whom used the stage surname hervey kate was a chorister who defected to the comedy opera companys rival production of hms pinafore where she had the opportunity to play josephine in  jennie was a doyly carte chorister for fourteen years rose took principal roles in many of the companion pieces that played with the savoy operas musicedit main article list of musical compositions by arthur sullivan method of composition and text settingedit sullivan by the cartoonist ape sullivan told an interviewer arthur lawrence i dont use the piano in composition – that would limit me terribly sullivan explained that his process was not to wait for inspiration but to dig for it  i decide on the rhythm before i come to the question of melody  i mark out the metre in dots and dashes and not until i have quite settled on the rhythm do i proceed to actual notation sullivans text setting compared with that of his th century english predecessors or his european contemporaries was vastly more sensitive  sullivans operatic style attempts to create for itself a uniquely english textmusic synthesis and in addition by adopting a conservative musical style he was able to achieve the clarity to match gilberts finely honed wit with musical wit of his own in composing the savoy operas sullivan wrote the vocal lines of the musical numbers first and these were given to the actors he or an assistant improvised a piano accompaniment at the early rehearsals he wrote the orchestrations later after he had seen what gilberts stage business would be he left the overtures until last and often delegated their composition based on his outlines to his assistants often adding his suggestions or corrections those sullivan wrote himself include thespis iolanthe princess ida the yeomen of the guard the gondoliers the grand duke and probably utopia limited most of the overtures are structured as a potpourri of tunes from the operas in three sections fast slow and fast those for iolanthe and the yeomen of the guard are written in a modified sonata form the overtures from the gilbert and sullivan operas remain popular and there are many recordings of them sullivan invariably conducted the operas on their opening nights in  a review in the times gave this rationale for the continued vitality of the savoy operas they were never really contemporary in their idiom  gilbert and sullivans world was an artificial world with a neatly controlled and shapely precision  for this each partner has his share of credit the neat articulation of incredibilities in gilberts plots is perfectly matched by his language  of equal importance  gilberts lyrics almost invariably take on extra point and sparkle when set to sullivans music  sullivans tunes in these operas also exist in a makebelieve world of their own  he is a delicate wit whose airs have a precision a neatness a grace and a flowing melody melody and rhythmedit the musical times noted that sullivans tunes at least in the comic operas appeal to the professional as much as to the layman his continental contemporaries such as saintsaëns and the viennese critic eduard hanslick held the savoy operas in high regard hughes writes when sullivan wrote what we call a good tune it was nearly always good music as well outside the ranks of the giants there are few other composers of whom the same could be said although his melodies sprang from rhythm some of his themes may have been prompted by his chosen instrumentation or his harmonic techniques favorite airs from the mikado a  edison records recording of selections from the mikado includes parts of the overture a wandring minstrel three little maids titwillow and the act ii finale problems playing this file see media help in the comic operas where many numbers were in verseplusrefrain form sullivan frequently produced two climaxes in the melodic line hughes instances if you go in iolanthe as a good example in hughess view though most of the tunes in the savoy operas are good ones sullivan rarely reached the same class of excellence elsewhere when he had no librettist to feed his imagination even so on those occasions when gilbert wrote in unvaried metre sullivan often followed suit and produced phrases of simple repetition such as love is a plaintive song patience and a man who would woo a fair maid the yeomen of the guard sullivans deliberate echoes of other composers are covered below under musical quotations but other echoes may not have been conscious hughes cites the concluding bars of tell a tale of cock and bull from the yeomen of the guard as an example of handels influence and another critic edward greenfield found a theme in the slow movement of the irish symphony an outrageous crib from schuberts unfinished symphony harmony and counterpointedit sullivans manuscript for act  finale the yeomen of the guard harmonyedit sullivan was trained in the classical style and contemporary music did not greatly attract him harmonically his early works used the conventional formulae of auber donizetti balfe and schubert later he drew on gounod and bizet mendelssohns influence conspicuous in early works appears intermittently in later ones as a contemporary writer observed sullivan draws on these various influences while remaining recognisably himself yet in the field of harmony hughes writes sullivan remained an eclectic he had easily recognisable habits but his style never achieved individuality in general sullivan preferred to write in major keys in the savoy operas there are only eleven substantial numbers wholly in a minor key less than  of the musical numbers and even in his serious works the major prevails examples of sullivans rare excursions into minor keys include the long e minor melody in the first movement of the irish symphony go away madam in the act i finale of iolanthe echoing verdi and beethoven and the funeral march in the act i finale of the yeomen of the guard sullivan was happy on occasion to use chords traditionally considered technically incorrect when reproached for using consecutive fifths in cox and box he replied if ths turn up it doesnt matter so long as there is no offence to the ear hughes comments that harmonic contrast in the savoy works is enhanced by sullivans characteristic modulation between keys as in expressive glances princess ida where he smoothly negotiates e major c sharp minor and c major or then one of us will be a queen the gondoliers where he writes in f major d flat major and d minor both hughes and jacobs in groves dictionary of music and musicians comment adversely on sullivans overuse of tonic pedals usually in the bass which hughes attributes to lack of enterprise or even downright laziness another sullivan trademark criticised by hughes is the repeated use of the chord of the augmented fourth at moments of pathos in his serious works sullivan attempted to avoid harmonic devices associated with the savoy operas with the result according to hughes that the golden legend is a hotchpotch of harmonic styles counterpointedit sullivan as a conductor c  despite his thorough contrapuntal training in london and leipzig as well as his experience as a church organist sullivan rarely composed fugues hughes cites examples from the epilogue to the golden legend and victoria and merrie england in the savoy operas fugal style is reserved for making fun of legal solemnity in trial by jury and iolanthe eg the lord chancellors leitmotif in the latter less formal counterpoint is employed in numbers such as brightly dawns our wedding day the mikado and when the buds are blossoming ruddigore sullivans best known contrapuntal device was the simultaneous presentation of two or more distinct melodies previously heard independently he was not the first composer to combine themes in this way but it became a characteristic feature of the gilbert and sullivan operas sometimes the melodies were for solo voices as in once more the face i loved so well the zoo and i am so proud the mikado which combines three melodic lines other examples are in choruses where typically a graceful tune for the ladies is combined with a robust one for the men examples include when the foeman bares his steel the pirates of penzance in a doleful train patience and welcome gentry ruddigore at other times notably in how beautifully blue the sky the pirates of penzance one theme is given to the chorus and the other to solo voices orchestrationedit gervase hughes concludes his chapter on sullivans orchestration in this vitally important sector of the composers art he deserves to rank as a master sullivan was a competent player of at least four orchestral instruments flute clarinet trumpet and trombone and a technically highly skilled orchestratorn  though sometimes inclined to indulge in grandiosity when writing for a full symphony orchestra he was adept in using smaller forces to the maximum effect percy young writes that orchestral players generally like playing sullivans music sullivan never asked his players to do what was either uncongenial or impracticable overture di ballo the overture di ballo  is regarded as sullivans most successful orchestral work this military band arrangement is performed by the us marine band problems playing this file see media help sullivans orchestra for the savoy operas was typical of any other pit orchestra of his era  flutes  piccolo oboe  clarinets bassoon  horns  cornets  trombones timpani percussion and strings according to geoffrey toye the number of players in sullivans savoy theatre orchestras was a minimum of  sullivan argued hard for an increase in the pit orchestras size and starting with the yeomen of the guard the orchestra was augmented with a second bassoon and a second tenor trombone sullivan generally orchestrated each score at almost the last moment noting that the accompaniment for an opera had to wait until he saw the staging so that he could judge how heavily or lightly to orchestrate each part of the music for his largescale orchestral pieces sullivan added a second oboe part sometimes double bassoon and bass clarinet more horns trumpets tuba and sometimes an organ andor a harp many of these pieces used very large orchestras one of the most recognisable features in sullivans orchestration is his woodwind scoring hughes especially notes sullivans clarinet writing exploiting all registers and colours of the instrument and his particular fondness for oboe solos for instance the irish symphony contains two long solo oboe passages in succession and in the savoy operas there are many shorter examples in the operas and also in concert works another characteristic sullivan touch is his fondness for pizzicato passages for all the string sections most of the operas have at least one number that hughes calls virtually a pizzicato ostinato he instances kind sir you cannot have the heart the gondoliers free from his fetters grim the yeomen of the guard and in vain to us you plead iolanthe musical quotations and parodiesedit sullivan in about  sullivan often quoted or imitated famous themes and passages from wellknown tunes or parodied the styles of famous composers he also liked to evoke familiar musical styles such as his madrigals in the mikado ruddigore and the yeomen of the guard glees in hms pinafore and the mikado and gavottes in ruddigore and the gondoliers in the sorcerer there is a country dance in if youll marry me in ruddigore the sailor character dances a hornpipe while in the mikado sullivan quotes a japanese war song in miya sama sullivans  trip to egypt inspired musical styles in his later opera the rose of persia of the sextette i hear the soft note in patience sullivan said to the singers i think you will like this it is dr arne and purcell at their best in early pieces he imitated mendelssohn for example in his incidental music for the tempest auber in his henry viii music and gounod in the light of the world in his comic operas sullivan followed offenbachs lead in parodying the idioms of french and italian opera such as those of donizetti bellini and verdi his music also shows the influence of handel schubert and conspicuously in the fairy music in iolanthe mendelssohn the thenpopular composer michael balfe is parodied in the sorcerer and the pirates of penzance and twenty love sick maidens imitates william vincent wallaces alas those chimes from maritana the sextet a nice dilemma in trial by jury parodies dun pensiero in bellinis la sonnambula sullivan depicted in  teasing the leading academic alexander mackenzie whose operetta his majesty failed at the savoy other examples of opera parody include mabels aria poor wandring one in the pirates of penzance and the duet who are you sir from cox and box in hms pinafore the whispered plans for elopement in this very night parody the conspirators choruses in verdis il trovatore and rigoletto and the octet farewell my own evokes the ensemble mag der

beethoven the clarinet and bassoon quote the fugue subject of bachs fantasia and fugue in g minor the golden legend shows the influence of liszt and wagner sullivan frequently gives groups or locations their own characters and motifs hughes points to the striking difference between the male chorus of rustics in the sorcerer and the eponymous gondoliers and between the fairies in iolanthe and the undergraduates in princess ida hms pinafore retains a nautical tang throughout and in the yeomen of the guard the tower of london is evoked continually by its own motif a distinctive fournote

receptionedit sullivans critical reputation has undergone extreme changes since he first came to prominence in the s at first critics were struck by his potential and he was hailed as the longawaited great english composer his incidental music to the tempest received an acclaimed premiere at the crystal palace just before sullivans th birthday in april  the athenaeum wrote it  may mark an epoch in english music or we shall be greatly disappointed years on years have elapsed since we have heard a work by so young an artist so full of promise so full of fancy showing so much conscientiousness so much skill and so few references to any model elect his irish symphony of  won similarly enthusiastic praise but as arthur jacobs notes the first rapturous outburst of enthusiasm for sullivan as an orchestral composer did not last a comment typical of those that followed him throughout his career was that sullivans unquestionable talent should make him doubly careful not to mistake popular applause for artistic appreciation when sullivan turned to comic opera with gilbert the serious critics began to express disapproval peter gammond writes of misapprehensions and prejudices delivered to our door by the victorian firm musical snobs ltd  frivolity and high spirits were sincerely seen as elements that could not be exhibited by anyone who was to be admitted to the sanctified society of art as early as  the figaro wrote that sullivan has all the ability to make him a great composer but he wilfully throws his opportunity away  he possesses all the natural ability to have given us an english opera and instead he affords us a little moreorless excellent fooling few critics denied the excellence of sullivans theatre scores the theatre wrote that iolanthe sustains dr sullivans reputation as the most spontaneous fertile and scholarly composer of comic opera this country has ever produced however comic opera no matter how skilfully crafted was viewed as an intrinsically lower form of art than oratorio the athenaeums review of the martyr of antioch declared it is an advantage to have the composer of hms pinafore occupying himself with a worthier form of art knighthood and later yearsedit sullivans knighthood in  gave the serious music critics further ammunition the musical review of that year wrote some things that mr arthur sullivan may do sir arthur ought not to do in other words it will look rather more than odd to see announced in the papers that a new comic opera is in preparation the book by mr w s gilbert and the music by sir arthur sullivan a musical knight can hardly write shop ballads either he must not dare to soil his hands with anything less than an anthem or a madrigal oratorio in which he has so conspicuously shone and symphony must now be his line here is not only an opportunity but a positive obligation for him to return to the sphere from which he has too long descended and do battle for the honour of english art  against all foreign rivals and arouse us thoroughly from our present halftorpid condition even sullivans friend george grove wrote surely the time has come when so able and experienced a master of voice orchestra and stage effect – master too of so much genuine sentiment – may apply his gifts to a serious opera on some subject of abiding human or natural interest sullivan finally redeemed himself in critical eyes with the golden legend in  the observer hailed it as a triumph of english art the world called it one of the greatest creations we have had for many years original bold inspired grand in conception in execution in treatment it is a composition which will make an epoch and which will carry the name of its composer higher on the wings of fame and glory  the effect of the public performance was unprecedented hopes for a new departure were evident in the daily telegraphs review of the yeomen of the guard  sullivans most serious opera to that point the music follows the book to a higher plane and we have a genuine english opera forerunner of many others let us hope and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage sullivans only wholly serious opera ivanhoe  received generally favourable reviews although j a fuller maitland in the times expressed reservations writing that the operas best portions rise so far above anything else that sir arthur sullivan has given to the world and have such force and dignity that it is not difficult to forget the drawbacks which may be found in the want of interest in much of the choral writing and the brevity of the concerted solo parts sullivans  ballet victoria and merrie england was one of several late pieces that won praise from most critics sir arthur sullivans music is music for the people there is no attempt made to force on the public the dullness of academic experience the melodies are all as fresh as last years wine and as exhilarating as sparkling champagne there is not one tune which tires the hearing and in the matter of orchestration our only humorist has let himself run riot not being handicapped with libretto and the gain is enormous  all through we have orchestration of infinite delicacy tunes of alarming simplicity but never a tinge of vulgarity although the more solemn members of the musical establishment could not forgive sullivan for writing music that was both comic and accessible he was nevertheless the nations de facto composer laureaten  posthumous reputationedit in the decade after his death sullivans reputation sank considerably in  fuller maitland took issue with the generally laudatory tone of most of the obituaries is there anywhere a case quite parallel to that of sir arthur sullivan who began his career with a work which at once stamped him as a genius and to the height of which he only rarely attained throughout life  it is because such great natural gifts – gifts greater perhaps than fell to any english musician since  purcell – were so very seldom employed in work worthy of them edward elgar to whom sullivan had been particularly kind rose to sullivans defence branding fuller maitlands obituary the shady side of musical criticism  that foul unforgettable episoden  fuller maitlands followers including ernest walker also dismissed sullivan as merely the idle singer of an empty evening as late as  frank howes music critic of the times condemned sullivan for a lack of sustained effort  a fundamental lack of seriousness towards his art and inability to perceive the smugness the sentimentality and banality of the mendelssohnian detritus  to remain content with the flattest and most obvious rhythms this yielding to a fatal facility that excludes sullivan from the ranks of the good composers th century audiences thomas f dunhill wrote in  that sullivans music has suffered in an extraordinary degree from the vigorous attacks which have been made upon it in professional circles these attacks have succeeded in surrounding the composer with a kind of barricade of prejudice which must be swept away before justice can be done to his genius sir henry wood continued to perform sullivans serious music in  wood presented a sullivan centenary concert at the royal albert hall but it was not until the s that sullivans music other than the savoy operas began to be widely revived and reassessed in  hughes published the first fulllength book about sullivans music which while taking note of his weaknesses which are many and not hesitating to castigate his lapses from good taste which were comparatively rare attempted to view them in perspective against the wider background of his sound musicianship the work of the sir arthur sullivan society founded in  books about sullivan by musicians such as young  and jacobs  and a growing number of recordings have contributed to the reevaluation of sullivans serious music the symphony in e had its first professional recording in  and a considerable number of sullivans nongilbert works have since been recorded scholarly critical editions of a growing number of sullivans works have been published in a  article in the musical times nigel burton wrote sullivan spoke naturally to all people for all time of the passions sorrows and joys which are forever rooted in the human consciousness he believed  that the human beings prime duty in life is to serve humanity it is his artistic consistency in this respect which obliges us to pronounce him our greatest victorian composer time has now sufficiently dispersed the mists of criticism for us to be able to see the truth to enjoy all his music and to rejoice in the rich diversity of its panoply  let us resolve to set aside the oneandahalfhurrahs syndrome once and for all and in its place raise three loud cheers recordingsedit on

critical censure of sullivan for his accessibility the applause which it received was general and spontaneous but it may be a question whether if mr sullivan could not be requested to furnish a higher

hanslick wrote of sullivans conducting of a mozart symphony sullivan presides on the podium from the comfortable recesses of a commodious armchair his left arm lazily extended on the armrest his right

most certainly never occurred to me to look for any other reward than the honour of being associated however remotely and unworthily in a success which i suppose will endure until music itself shall die pray believe that of the many substantial advantages that have resulted to me from our association this last is and always will be the most highly prized  even after gilbert made changes but retained a magic lozenge that changed people into what they pretended to be sullivan could not accept it  the longestrunning piece of musical theatre was robert planquettes  opéracomique les cloches de corneville which held the record until alfred celliers operetta dorothy ran for  performances beginning in   king olaf caractacus and gerontius owe much to the golden legend – as via them does waltons belshazzars feast  gilbert wrote we have a name jointly for humorous work tempered with occasional glimpses of earnest drama i think we should do unwisely if we left altogether the path which we have trodden together so long and so successfully i can quite understand your desire to write a big work well why not write one but why abandon the savoy business cannot the two things be done concurrently if you can write an oratorio like the martyr of antioch while you are occupied by pieces like patience and iolanthe cant you write a grand opera without giving up pieces like the yeomen of the guard  sullivan continued i have lost the necessary nerve for it and it is not too much to say that it is distasteful to me the types used over and over again unavoidable in such a company as ours the grossmith part the middleaged woman with fading charms cannot again be clothed in music by me nor can i again write to any wildly improbable plot in which there is not some human interest  you say that in serious opera you must more or less sacrifice yourself i say that this is just what i have been doing in all our joint pieces and what is more must continue to do in comic opera to make it successful business and syllabic setting assume an importance which however much they fetter me cannot be overlooked i am bound in the interests of the piece to give way hence the reason of my wishing to do a work where the music is to be the first consideration – where words are to suggest music not govern it and where music will intensify and emphasize the emotional effects of the words  sullivans biographers and scholars of his work have censured tennysons text gervase hughes called it puerile rubbish percy young found it devoid of any kind of merit whatsoever sullivans music was initially wellreceived but sullivans biographers were not impressed one of sullivans lamest  resourceless in magic young not even one memorable number jacobs recent critics however have praised sullivans contribution  caryl brahms speculates that sullivans relationship with his friend the duke of edinburgh who was married included sex but the only evidence cited is unspecified victorian cartoonists  one such flirtation was with anna whom he met in paris in   in  fred appeared as cox in his brothers cox and box at the alhambra theatre and he toured as cox in his own production that summer later that year he played apollo in gilbert and sullivans thespis at the gaiety theatre remaining at the gaiety thereafter he took his own company on tour in the summer of  appearing in his brothers cox and box and the contrabandista and later that year he again played cox this time at the gaiety the next year he created the role of the learned judge in gilbert and sullivans trial by jury a role that he would play in london and on tour for the rest of his career  sullivan could also play the oboe and bassoon but less proficiently  gian andrea mazzucato wrote this glowing summary of sullivans career in the musical standard of  december  the english history of the th century could not record the name of a man whose life work is more worthy of honour study and admiration than the name of sir arthur sullivan  it is a debatable point whether the universal history of music can point to any musical personality since the days of haydn mozart and beethoven whose influence is likely to be more lasting than the influence the great englishman is slowly but surely exerting  i make no doubt that when in proper course of time sir arthur sullivans life and works have become known on the continent he will by unanimous consent be classed among the epochmaking composers the select few whose genius and strength of will empowered them to find and found a national school of music that is to endow their countrymen with the undefinable yet positive means of evoking in a mans soul by the magic of sound those delicate nuances of feeling which are characteristic of the emotional power of each different race  fuller maitland was later discredited when it was shown that he had invented a banal lyric passing it off as genuine and condemning sullivan for supposedly setting such inanity in  fuller maitland admitted that he had been wrong in earlier years to dismiss sullivans comic operas as ephemeral  the first was take a pair of sparkling eyes from the

coghlan – english born of irish and italian descent thomas sullivan was based from  to  at the royal military college sandhurst where he was the bandmaster and taught music privately to supplement his income young sullivan became proficient with many of the instruments in the band and had composed an anthem by the waters of babylon by the age of eight he later recalled i was intensely interested in all that the band did and learned to play every wind instrument with which i formed not merely a passing acquaintance but a real lifelong intimate friendship i gradually learned the peculiarities of each  what it could do and what it was unable to do i learned in the best possible way how to write for an orchestra while recognising the boys obvious musical talent his father knew the insecurity of a musical career and discouraged him from pursuing it while studying at a private school in bayswater sullivan then aged  persuaded his parents and the headmaster to allow him to apply for membership in the choir of the chapel royal despite concerns that sullivan at nearly  years of age was too old to give much service as a treble before his voice broke he was accepted and soon became a soloist and by  was promoted to first boy even at this age sullivans health was delicate and he was easily fatigued sullivan flourished under the training of the reverend thomas helmore master of the choristers and began to compose anthems and songs helmore encouraged the young sullivans composing talent and arranged for one of his pieces o israel to be published in  sullivans first published work helmore also enlisted sullivans assistance in creating harmonisations for a volume of the hymnal noted and arranged for sullivans compositions to be performed one of the boys anthems was given at the chapel royal in st jamess palace under the direction of sir george smart mendelssohn scholaredit sullivan at age  in his academy of music uniform in  the royal academy of music awarded the first

studied piano with the head of the academy william sterndale bennett and with arthur oleary during this year at the royal academy sullivan continued to sing solos with the chapel royal which provided a small amount of spending money sullivans scholarship was extended to a second year and in  in what the biographer arthur jacobs calls an extraordinary gesture of confidence the scholarship committee extended his grant for a third year so that he could study in germany at the leipzig conservatoire while there sullivan studied composition with julius rietz and carl reinecke counterpoint with moritz hauptmann and ernst richter and the piano with louis plaidy and ignaz moscheles he was trained in mendelssohns ideas and techniques but was also exposed to a variety of musical styles including schubert verdi bach and wagner visiting a synagoguen  he was so struck by some of the cadences and progressions of the music that thirty years later he could recall them for use in his serious opera ivanhoe though the scholarship was extended to permit sullivan to spend one year in leipzig he stayed for three years there he became friendly with the impresario carl rosa and the violinist joseph joachim for his last year at leipzig his father scraped together the money for living expenses and the conservatoire assisted by waiving its fees sullivan credited his leipzig period with tremendous musical growth his graduation piece completed in  was a set of incidental music to shakespeares the tempest revised and expanded it was performed at the crystal palace in  a year after his return to london and was an immediate sensation he began building a reputation as englands most promising young composer rising composeredit colleagues and collaborators clockwise from top left george grove f c burnand richard doyly carte w s gilbert sullivan embarked on his composing career with a series of ambitious works interspersed with hymns parlour songs and other light pieces in a more commercial vein his compositions were not enough to support him financially and from  to  he supplemented his income by working as a church organist which he enjoyed and as a music teacher sometimes at the crystal palace school which he hated and gave up as soon as he couldn  sullivan had an early chance to compose several pieces for royalty in connection with the wedding of the prince of wales in  sullivans association with works for voice and orchestra began with the masque at kenilworth birmingham festival  during a spell as organist at covent garden he composed his first ballet lîle enchantée  in  he premiered his irish symphony and cello concerto his only works in each such genre in the same year his overture in c in memoriam commemorating the recent death of his father was a commission from the norwich festival during his lifetime it achieved considerable popularity in  his overture marmion was premiered by the philharmonic society the times called it another step in advance on the part of the only composer of any remarkable promise that just at present we can boast in the autumn of  sullivan travelled with george grove to vienna in search of neglected manuscript scores by schubert they found and copied several and were particularly excited about their final discovery the score to rosamunden  sullivans first attempt at opera the sapphire necklace – to a libretto by henry f chorley was not produced and is now lost except for the overture and two songs from the work which were separately published his first surviving opera cox and box  was written for a private performance it then received charity performances in london and manchester and was later produced at the gallery of illustration where it ran for an extraordinary  performances w s gilbert writing in fun magazine pronounced the score superior to f c burnands libretto sullivan and burnand were soon commissioned by thomas german reed for a twoact opera the contrabandista  revised and expanded as the chieftain in  but it did not do as well sullivan wrote a group of seven part songs in  the bestknown of which is the long day closes sullivans last major work of the s was a short oratorio the prodigal son premiered in worcester cathedral as part of the  three choirs festival to much praise s first collaborations with gilbertedit early poster showing scenes from the sorcerer hms pinafore and trial by jury sullivans most enduring orchestral work the overture di ballo was composed for the birmingham festival in n  also in  sullivan met gilbert  was a busy year for sullivan he published his only song cycle the window or the songs of the wrens to words by tennyson and he wrote the first of a series of suites of incidental music for west end productions of shakespeare playsn  still in  sullivan composed a dramatic cantata on shore and sea for the opening of the london international exhibition and the hymn onward christian soldiers with words by sabine baringgould the salvation army adopted the latter as its favoured processional and it became sullivans most enduring hymn at the end of  the impresario john hollingshead commissioned sullivan to work with w s gilbert to create the burlesquestyle comic opera thespis for the gaiety theatren  played as a christmas entertainment it ran through to easter  a good run for such a piecen  after thespis gilbert and sullivan went their separate ways until they collaborated on three parlour ballads in late  and early  sullivans largescale works of the early s were the festival te deum crystal palace  and the oratorio the light of the world birmingham festival  he provided suites of incidental music for productions of the merry wives of windsor at the gaiety in  and henry viii at the theatre royal manchester in  he continued to compose hymns throughout the decaden  in  sullivan contributed songs to burnands christmas drawing room extravaganza the miller and his man in  the manager of the royalty theatre richard doyly carte needed a short piece to fill out a bill with offenbachs la périchole carte had conducted sullivans cox and boxn  remembering that gilbert had suggested a libretto to him carte reunited gilbert and sullivan and the result was the oneact comic opera trial by juryn  trial starring sullivans brother fred as the learned judge became a surprise hit earning glowing praise from the critics and playing for  performances over its first few seasons the daily telegraph commented that the piece illustrated the composers great capacity for dramatic writing of the lighter class and other reviews emphasised the felicitous combination of gilberts words and sullivans music one wrote it seems as in the great wagnerian operas as though poem and music had proceeded simultaneously from one and the same brain soon after the opening of trial sullivan wrote the zoo another oneact comic opera with a libretto by b c stephenson but the latter work had only a few short runs and for the next  years sullivans sole operatic collaborator was gilbert the two created an additional  operas together the lost chord  recording of the lost chord  by arthur sullivan and adelaide anne procter sung by reed miller problems playing this file see media help sullivan also turned out more than  popular songs and parlour ballads most of them written before the end of the s his first popular song was orpheus with his lute  and a wellreceived part song was oh hush thee my babie  the best known of his songs is the lost chord  lyrics by adelaide anne procter written in sorrow at the death of his brother frederic the sheet music for his best received songs sold in large numbers and were an important part of his income many of them were adapted as dance pieces in this decade sullivans conducting appointments included the glasgow choral union concerts – and the royal aquarium london  in addition to his appointment as professor of composition at the royal academy of music of which he was a fellow he was appointed as the first principal of the national training school for music in  he accepted the latter post reluctantly fearing that discharging the duties thoroughly would leave too little time for composing in this he was correct as his successor hubert parry also discovered sullivan was not effective in the post and he resigned in n  sullivans next collaboration with gilbert the sorcerer  ran for  performances a success by the standards of the day but hms pinafore  which followed it turned gilbert and sullivan into an international phenomenon the bright and cheerful music of pinafore was composed during a time when sullivan suffered from excruciating pain from a kidney stone pinafore ran for  performances in london the thensecondlongest theatrical run in history and more than  unauthorised productions were quickly mounted in america alonen  among other favourable reviews the times noted that the opera was an early attempt at the establishment of a national musical stage  free from risqué french improprieties and without the aid of italian and german musical models the times and several of the other papers agreed however that while the piece was entertaining sullivan was capable of higher art and frivolous light opera would hold him back this criticism would follow sullivan throughout his career in  sullivan suggested to a reporter from the new york times the secret of his success with gilbert his ideas are as suggestive for music as they are quaint and laughable his numbers  always give me musical ideas pinafore was followed by the pirates of penzance in  another international success which opened in new york and then ran in london for  performances early sedit scenes from the premiere of the golden legend at the leeds music festival  in  sullivan was appointed director of the triennial leeds music festival for his first festival he was commissioned to write a sacred choral work he chose henry hart milmans  dramatic poem based on the life and death of saint margaret the virgin for its basis gilbert adapted the libretto for sullivan the martyr of antioch premiered in october  sullivan was not a showy

of the operas to premiere at the new theatre sullivan despite the financial security of writing for the savoy increasingly viewed his work with gilbert as unimportant beneath his skills and also repetitious after iolanthe sullivan had not intended to write a new work with gilbert but he suffered a serious financial loss when his broker went bankrupt in november  therefore he concluded that his financial needs required him to continue writing savoy operas in february  he and gilbert signed a fiveyear agreement with carte requiring them to produce a new comic opera on six months notice on  may  sullivan was knighted by queen victoria for his services  rendered to the promotion of the art of music in britain the musical establishment and many critics believed that this should put an end to his career as a composer of comic opera – that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera having just signed the fiveyear agreement sullivan suddenly felt trapped in

effectively ended his career at the age of  sullivan reflecting on this on his own longstanding kidney problems and on his desire to devote himself to more serious music replied to carte it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by gilbert and myself programme for the mikado  gilbert had already started work on a new opera involving a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge the composer wrote on  april  that he had come to the end of my tether with the operas i have been continually keeping down the music in order that not one syllable should be lost  i should like to set a story of human interest  probability where the humorous words would come in a humorous not serious situation  where if the situation were a tender or dramatic one the words would be of similar character in a lengthy exchange of correspondence sullivan pronounced gilberts plot sketch particularly the lozenge element unacceptably mechanical and too similar in both its grotesque elements of topsyturveydom and in actual plot to their earlier work especially the sorcerern  and repeatedly requested that gilbert find a new subject the impasse was finally resolved on  may when gilbert proposed a plot that did not depend on any supernatural device the result was gilbert and sullivans most successful work the mikado  the piece ran for  performances which was the secondlongest run for any work of musical theatre and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece up to that timen  later sedit portrait by millais  in the national portrait gallery london it hangs next to frank holls  portrait of gilbert in  sullivan composed his second and last largescale choral work of the decade it was a cantata for the leeds festival the golden legend based on longfellows poem of the same name apart from the comic operas this proved to be sullivans best received fulllength work it was given hundreds of performances during his lifetime and at one point he declared a moratorium on its presentation fearing that it would become overexposed only handels messiah was performed more often in britain in the s and s it remained in the repertory until about the s but since then it has been seldom performed although it received its first professional recording in  the musical scholar and conductor david russell hulme writes that the work influenced elgar and waltonn  ruddigore followed the mikado at the savoy in  it was profitable but its ninemonth run was disappointing compared with most of the earlier savoy operas for their next piece gilbert submitted another version of the magic lozenge plot sullivan immediately rejected it gilbert finally proposed a comparatively serious opera to which sullivan agreed although it was not a grand opera the yeomen of the guard  provided him with the opportunity to compose his most ambitious stage work to date as early as  sullivan had been under pressure from the musical establishment to write a grand opera in  he told an interviewer the opera of the future is a compromise among the french german and italian schools – a sort of eclectic school a selection of the merits of each one i myself will make an attempt to produce a grand opera of this new school  yes it will be an historical work and it is the dream of my life after the yeomen of the guard opened sullivan turned once again to shakespeare composing incidental music for henry irvings production of macbeth  sullivan wished to produce further serious works with gilbert he had collaborated with no other librettist since  but gilbert felt that the reaction to the yeomen of the guard had not been so convincing as to warrant us in assuming that the public want something more earnest still he proposed instead that sullivan should go ahead with his plan to write a grand opera but should continue also to compose comic works for the savoyn  sullivan was not immediately persuaded he replied i have lost the liking for writing comic opera and entertain very grave doubts as to my power of doing itn  nevertheless sullivan soon commissioned a grand opera libretto from julian sturgis who was recommended by gilbert while suggesting to gilbert that he revive an old idea for an opera set in colourful venice the comic opera was completed first the gondoliers  was a piece described by gervase hughes as a pinnacle of sullivans achievement it was the last great gilbert and sullivan success sedit ivanhoe  the relationship between gilbert and sullivan suffered its most serious breach in april  during the run of the gondoliers when gilbert objected to cartes financial accounts for the production including a charge to the partnership for the cost of new carpeting for the savoy theatre lobby gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to carte alone carte was building a new theatre to present sullivans forthcoming grand opera and sullivan sided with carte going so far as to testify erroneously as to certain old debts gilbert took legal action against carte and sullivan and vowed to write no more for the savoy and so the partnership came to an acrimonious end sullivan wrote to gilbert in september  that he was physically and mentally ill over this wretched business i have not yet got over the shock of seeing our names coupled  in hostile antagonism over a few miserable pounds sullivans only grand opera ivanhoe based on walter scotts novel opened at cartes new royal english opera house on  january  sullivan completed the score too late to meet cartes planned production date and costs mounted sullivan was required to pay carte a contractual penalty of £ for his delay the production lasted for  consecutive performances an unprecedented run for a serious opera and earned good notices for its music afterwards carte was unable to fill the new opera house with other opera productions however and ivanhoe was blamed for the failure of the opera house the opera passed into obscurity after a touring revival in – the episode was as the critic herman klein observed the strangest comingling of success and failure ever chronicled in the history of british lyric enterprise sullivan did not seriously consider writing grand opera again later in  sullivan composed music for tennysons the foresters which ran well at dalys theatre in new york in  but failed in london the following yearn  poster for the chieftain  sullivan returned to comic opera but because of the fracture with gilbert he and carte sought other collaborators sullivans next piece was haddon hall  with a libretto by sydney grundy based loosely on the historical elopement of dorothy vernon with john manners although still comic the tone and style of the work was considerably more serious and romantic than most of the operas with gilbert it enjoyed a modest popularity running for  performances and earned critical praise in  sullivan once more provided incidental music for the lyceum this time for j comyns carrs king arthur the partnership with gilbert had been so profitable that carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer eventually succeeding with the help of tom chappell their music publisher their next opera utopia limited  ran for  performances barely covering the expenses of the lavish production although it was the longest run at the savoy in the s sullivan came to disapprove of the leading lady nancy mcintosh and refused to write another piece featuring her while gilbert insisted that she must appear in his next opera instead sullivan teamed up again with his old partner f c burnand the chieftain  a heavily revised version of their earlier twoact opera the contrabandista flopped gilbert and sullivan reunited one more time after mcintosh announced her retirement from the stage for the grand duke  this also failed and sullivan never worked with gilbert again although their operas continued to be revived with success at the savoy in may  sullivans fulllength ballet victoria and merrie england opened at the alhambra theatre to celebrate the queens diamond jubilee the works seven scenes celebrate english history and culture with the victorian period as the grand finale its sixmonth run was considered a great achievement the beauty stone  with a libretto by arthur wing pinero and j comyns carr was based on mediaeval morality plays the collaboration did not go particularly well sullivan wrote that pinero and comyns carr were gifted and brilliant men with no experience in writing for music and when he asked for alterations to improve the structure they refused sullivans score moreover was too serious for the savoy audiences tastes the opera was a critical failure and did not attract a following running for only seven weeks in  to benefit the wives and children of soldiers and sailors on active service in the boer war sullivan composed the music of a jingoistic song the absentminded beggar to a text by rudyard kipling which became an instant sensation and raised an unprecedented £ from performances and the sale of sheet music and related merchandise in the rose of persia  sullivan returned to his comic roots writing to a libretto by basil hood that combined an exotic arabian nights setting with plot elements of the mikado sullivans tuneful score was well received and the opera proved to be his most successful fulllength collaboration apart from those with gilbert another opera with hood the emerald isle quickly went into preparation but sullivan died

operas are not only frequently performed but also frequently parodied pastiched quoted and imitated in comedy routines advertising law film television and other popular media his legacy apart from writing the savoy operas and his other works is felt perhaps most strongly today through his influence on the american and british musical theatre the innovations in content and form of the works that

features small and exquisitely regular her hair was a dark shade of brown – châtain foncé deep chestnut – and very abundant  a lovely woman with the most generous smile one could possibly imagine and the most beautiful teeth sullivan called her the best amateur singer in london she often performed sullivans songs at her famous sunday soirees she became particularly associated with the lost chord singing it both in private and in public often with sullivan accompanying her when sullivan died he left her the autograph manuscript of that song along with other bequests ronalds was separated from her american husband but they never divorced social conventions of the time compelled sullivan and ronalds to keep their relationship private in his diary he would refer to her as mrs ronalds when he

interviewer arthur lawrence i dont use the piano in composition – that would limit me terribly sullivan explained that his process was not to wait for inspiration but to dig for it  i decide on the rhythm before i come to the question of melody  i mark out the metre in dots and dashes and not until i have quite settled on the rhythm do i proceed to actual notation sullivans text setting compared with that of his th century english predecessors or his european contemporaries was vastly more sensitive  sullivans operatic style attempts to create for itself a uniquely english textmusic synthesis and in addition by adopting a conservative musical style he was able to achieve the clarity to match gilberts finely honed wit with musical wit of his own in composing the savoy operas sullivan wrote the vocal lines of the musical numbers first and these were given to the actors he or an assistant improvised a piano accompaniment at the early rehearsals he wrote the orchestrations later after he had seen what gilberts stage business would be he left the overtures until last and often delegated their composition based on his outlines to his assistants often adding his suggestions or corrections those sullivan wrote himself include thespis iolanthe princess ida the yeomen of the guard the gondoliers the grand duke and probably utopia limited most of the overtures are structured as a potpourri of tunes from the operas in three sections fast slow and fast those for iolanthe and the yeomen of the guard are written in a modified sonata form the overtures from the gilbert and sullivan operas remain popular and there are many recordings of them sullivan invariably conducted the operas on their opening nights in  a review in the times gave this rationale for the continued vitality of the savoy operas they were never really contemporary in their idiom  gilbert and sullivans world was an artificial world with a neatly controlled and shapely precision  for this each partner has his share of credit the neat articulation of incredibilities in gilberts plots is perfectly matched by his language  of equal importance  gilberts lyrics almost invariably take on extra point and sparkle when set to sullivans music  sullivans tunes in these operas also exist in a makebelieve world of their own  he is a delicate wit whose airs have a precision a neatness a grace and a flowing melody melody and rhythmedit the musical times noted that sullivans tunes at least in the comic operas appeal to the professional as much as to the layman his continental contemporaries such as saintsaëns and the viennese critic eduard hanslick held the savoy operas in high regard hughes writes when sullivan wrote what we call a good tune it was nearly always good music as well outside the ranks of the giants there are few other composers of whom the same could be said although his melodies sprang from rhythm some of his themes may have been prompted by his chosen instrumentation or his harmonic techniques favorite airs from the mikado a  edison records recording of selections from the mikado includes parts of the overture a wandring minstrel three little maids titwillow and the act ii finale problems playing this file see media help in the comic operas where many numbers were in verseplusrefrain form sullivan frequently produced two climaxes in the melodic line hughes instances if you go in iolanthe as a good example in hughess view though most of the tunes in the savoy operas are good ones sullivan rarely reached the same class of excellence elsewhere when he had no librettist to feed his imagination even so on those occasions when gilbert wrote in unvaried metre sullivan often followed suit and produced phrases of simple repetition such as love is a plaintive song patience and a man who would woo a fair maid the yeomen of the guard sullivans deliberate echoes of other composers are covered below under musical quotations but other echoes may not have been conscious hughes cites the concluding bars of tell a tale of cock and bull from the yeomen of the guard as an example of handels influence and another critic edward greenfield found a theme in the slow movement of the irish symphony an outrageous crib from schuberts unfinished symphony harmony and counterpointedit sullivans manuscript for act  finale the yeomen of the guard harmonyedit sullivan was trained in the classical style and contemporary music did not greatly attract him harmonically his early works used the conventional formulae of auber donizetti balfe and schubert later he drew on gounod and bizet mendelssohns influence conspicuous in early works appears intermittently in later ones as a contemporary writer observed sullivan draws on these various influences while remaining recognisably himself yet in the field of harmony hughes writes sullivan remained an eclectic he had easily recognisable habits but his style never achieved individuality in general sullivan preferred to write in major keys in the savoy operas there are only eleven substantial numbers wholly in a minor key less than  of the musical numbers and even in his serious works the major prevails examples of sullivans rare excursions into minor keys include the long e minor melody in the first movement of the irish symphony go away madam in the act i finale of iolanthe echoing verdi and beethoven and the funeral march in the act i finale of the yeomen of the guard sullivan was happy on occasion to use chords traditionally considered technically incorrect when reproached for using consecutive fifths in cox and box he replied if ths turn up it doesnt matter so long as there is no offence to the ear hughes comments that harmonic contrast in the savoy works is enhanced by sullivans characteristic modulation between keys as in expressive glances princess ida where he smoothly negotiates e major c sharp minor and c major or then one of us will be a queen the gondoliers where he writes in f major d flat major and d minor both hughes and jacobs in groves dictionary of music and musicians comment adversely on sullivans overuse of tonic pedals usually in the bass which hughes attributes to lack of enterprise or even downright laziness another sullivan trademark criticised by hughes is the repeated use of the chord of the augmented fourth at moments of pathos in his serious works sullivan attempted to avoid harmonic devices associated with the savoy operas with the result according to hughes that the golden legend is a hotchpotch of harmonic styles counterpointedit sullivan as a conductor c  despite his thorough contrapuntal training in london and leipzig as well as his experience as a church organist sullivan rarely composed fugues hughes cites examples from the epilogue to the golden legend and victoria and merrie england in the savoy operas fugal style is reserved for making fun of legal solemnity in trial by jury and iolanthe eg the lord chancellors leitmotif in the latter less formal counterpoint is employed in numbers such as brightly dawns our wedding day the mikado and when the buds are blossoming ruddigore sullivans best known contrapuntal device was the simultaneous presentation of two or more distinct melodies previously heard independently he was not the first composer to combine themes in this way but it became a characteristic feature of the gilbert and sullivan operas sometimes the melodies were for solo voices as in once more the face i loved so well the zoo and i am so proud the mikado which combines three melodic lines other examples are in choruses where typically a graceful tune for the ladies is combined with a robust one for the men examples include when the foeman bares his steel the pirates of penzance in a doleful train patience and welcome gentry ruddigore at other times notably in how beautifully blue the sky the pirates of penzance one theme is given to the chorus and the other to solo voices orchestrationedit gervase hughes concludes his chapter on sullivans orchestration in this vitally important sector of the composers art he deserves to rank as a master sullivan was a competent player of at least four orchestral instruments flute clarinet trumpet and trombone and a technically highly skilled orchestratorn  though sometimes inclined to indulge in grandiosity when writing for a full symphony orchestra he was adept in using smaller forces to the maximum effect percy young writes that orchestral players generally like playing sullivans music sullivan never asked his players to do what was either uncongenial or impracticable overture di ballo the overture di ballo  is regarded as sullivans most successful orchestral work this military band arrangement is performed by the us

cornets  trombones timpani percussion and strings according to geoffrey toye the number of players in sullivans savoy theatre orchestras was a minimum of  sullivan argued hard for an increase in the pit orchestras size and starting with the yeomen of the guard the orchestra was augmented with a second bassoon and a second tenor trombone sullivan generally orchestrated each score at almost the last moment noting that the accompaniment for an opera had to wait until he saw the staging so that he could judge how heavily or lightly to orchestrate each part of the music for his largescale orchestral pieces sullivan added a second oboe part sometimes double bassoon and bass clarinet more horns trumpets tuba and sometimes an organ andor a harp many of these pieces used very large orchestras one of the most recognisable features in sullivans orchestration is his woodwind scoring hughes especially notes sullivans clarinet writing exploiting all registers and colours of the instrument and his particular fondness for oboe solos for instance the irish symphony contains two long solo oboe passages in succession and in the savoy operas there are many shorter examples in the operas and also in concert works another characteristic sullivan touch is his fondness for pizzicato passages for all the string sections most of the operas have at least one number that hughes calls virtually a pizzicato ostinato he instances kind sir you cannot have the heart the gondoliers free from his fetters grim the yeomen of the guard and in vain to us you plead iolanthe musical quotations

imitated mendelssohn for example in his incidental music for the tempest auber in his henry viii music and gounod in the light of the world in his comic operas sullivan followed offenbachs lead in parodying the idioms of french and italian opera such as those of donizetti bellini and verdi his music also shows the influence of handel schubert and conspicuously in the fairy music in iolanthe

reputation has undergone extreme changes since he first came to prominence in the s at first critics were struck by his potential and he was hailed as the longawaited great english composer his incidental music to the tempest received an acclaimed premiere at the crystal palace just before sullivans th birthday in april  the athenaeum wrote it  may mark an epoch in english music or we shall be greatly disappointed years on years have elapsed since we have heard a work by so young an artist so full of promise so full of fancy showing so much conscientiousness so much skill and so few references to any model elect his irish symphony of  won similarly enthusiastic praise but as arthur jacobs notes the first rapturous outburst of enthusiasm for sullivan as an orchestral composer did not last a comment typical of those that followed him throughout his career was that sullivans unquestionable talent should make him doubly careful not to mistake popular applause for artistic appreciation when sullivan turned to comic opera with gilbert the serious critics began to express disapproval peter gammond writes of misapprehensions and prejudices delivered to our door by the victorian firm musical snobs ltd  frivolity and high spirits were sincerely seen as elements that could not be exhibited by anyone who was to be admitted to the sanctified society of art as early as  the figaro wrote that sullivan has all the ability to make him a great composer but he wilfully throws his opportunity away  he possesses all the natural ability to have given us an english opera and instead he affords us a little moreorless excellent fooling few critics denied the excellence of sullivans theatre scores the theatre wrote that iolanthe sustains dr sullivans reputation as the most spontaneous fertile and scholarly composer of comic opera this country has ever produced however comic opera no matter how skilfully crafted was viewed as an intrinsically lower form of art than oratorio the athenaeums review of the martyr of antioch declared it is an advantage to have the composer of hms pinafore occupying himself with a worthier form of art knighthood and later yearsedit sullivans knighthood in  gave the serious music critics further ammunition the musical review of that year wrote some things that mr arthur sullivan may do sir arthur ought not to do in other words it

shop ballads either he must not dare to soil his hands with anything less than an anthem or a madrigal oratorio in which he has so conspicuously shone and symphony must now be his line here is not only an opportunity but a positive obligation for him to return to the sphere from which he has too long descended and do battle for the honour of english art  against all foreign rivals and arouse us thoroughly from our present halftorpid condition even sullivans friend george grove wrote surely the time has come when so able and experienced a master of voice orchestra and stage effect – master too of so much genuine sentiment – may apply his gifts to a serious opera on some subject of abiding human or natural interest sullivan finally redeemed himself in critical eyes with the golden legend in  the observer hailed it as a triumph of english art the world called it one of the greatest creations we have had for many years original bold inspired grand in conception in execution in treatment

departure were evident in the daily telegraphs review of the yeomen of the guard  sullivans most serious opera to that point the music follows the book to a higher plane and we have a genuine english opera forerunner of many others let us hope and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage sullivans only wholly serious opera ivanhoe  received generally favourable reviews although j a fuller maitland in the times expressed reservations writing that the operas best portions rise so far above anything else that sir arthur sullivan has given to the world and have such force and dignity that it is not difficult to forget the drawbacks which may be found in the want of interest in much of the choral writing and the brevity of the concerted solo parts sullivans  ballet victoria and merrie england was one of several late pieces that won praise from most critics sir arthur sullivans music is music for the people there is no attempt made to force on the public the dullness of academic experience the melodies are all as fresh as last years wine and as exhilarating as sparkling champagne there is not one tune which tires the hearing and in the matter of orchestration our only humorist has let himself run riot not being handicapped with libretto and the gain is enormous  all through we have orchestration of infinite delicacy tunes of alarming simplicity but never a tinge of vulgarity although the more solemn members of the musical establishment could not forgive sullivan for writing music that was both comic and accessible he was nevertheless the nations de facto composer laureaten  posthumous reputationedit in the decade after his death sullivans reputation sank considerably in  fuller maitland took issue with the generally laudatory tone of most of the obituaries is there anywhere a case quite parallel to that of sir arthur sullivan who began his career with a work which at once stamped him as a genius and to the height of which he only rarely attained throughout life  it is because such great natural gifts – gifts greater perhaps than fell to any english musician since  purcell – were so very seldom employed in work worthy of them edward elgar to whom sullivan had been particularly kind rose to sullivans defence branding fuller maitlands obituary the shady side of musical criticism  that foul unforgettable episoden  fuller maitlands followers including ernest walker also dismissed sullivan as merely the idle singer of an empty evening as late as  frank howes music critic of the times condemned sullivan for a lack of sustained effort  a fundamental lack of seriousness towards his art and inability to perceive the smugness the sentimentality and banality of the mendelssohnian detritus  to remain content with the flattest and most obvious rhythms this yielding to a fatal facility that excludes sullivan from the ranks of the good composers th century audiences thomas f dunhill wrote in  that sullivans music has suffered in an extraordinary degree from the vigorous attacks which have been made upon it in professional circles these attacks have succeeded in surrounding the composer with a kind of barricade of prejudice which must be swept away before justice can be done to his genius sir henry wood continued to perform sullivans serious music in  wood presented a sullivan centenary concert at the royal albert hall but it was not until the s that sullivans music other than the savoy operas began to be widely revived and reassessed in  hughes published the first fulllength book about sullivans music which while taking note of his weaknesses which are many and not hesitating to castigate his lapses from good taste which were comparatively rare attempted to view them in perspective against the wider background of his sound musicianship the work of the sir arthur sullivan society founded in  books about sullivan by musicians such as young  and jacobs  and a growing number of recordings have contributed to the reevaluation of sullivans serious music the symphony in e had its first professional recording in  and a considerable number of sullivans nongilbert works have since been recorded scholarly critical editions of a growing number of sullivans works have been published in a  article in the musical times nigel burton wrote sullivan spoke naturally to all people for all time of the passions sorrows and joys which are forever rooted in the human consciousness he believed  that the human beings prime duty in life is to serve humanity it is his artistic consistency in this respect which obliges us to pronounce him our greatest victorian composer time has now sufficiently dispersed the mists of criticism for us to be able to see the truth to enjoy all his music and to rejoice in the rich diversity of its panoply  let us resolve to set aside the oneandahalfhurrahs syndrome once and for all and in its place raise three loud cheers recordingsedit on  august  george gouraud introduced thomas edisons phonograph to london in a press conference including the playing of a piano and cornet recording of sullivans the lost chord one of the first recordings of music ever made sullivan was invited to a party on  october  given to demonstrate the technology after dinner he recorded a speech to be sent to edison saying in part i can only say that i am astonished and somewhat terrified at the result of this evenings experiments astonished at the wonderful power you have developed and terrified at the thought that so much hideous and bad music may be put on record forever but all the same i think it is the most wonderful thing that i have ever experienced and i congratulate you with all my heart on this wonderful discovery these recordings were discovered in the edison library in new jersey in the s the lost chord one of the recordings played at the  august  press conference afterdinner speech at the little menlo sullivans phonographic letter to thomas edison  october  problems listening to the files see media help advertisement for the first recording of the mikado  the first commercial recordings of sullivans music beginning in  were of individual numbers from the savoy operasn  in  the gramophone company also known as hmv produced the first album of a complete musical score of a gilbert and sullivan opera the mikado followed by recordings of eight more of the operas electrical recordings of the complete musical scores of most of the operas were then issued by the gramophone company and victor talking machine company beginning in the late s these recordings were supervised by rupert doyly carte the doyly carte opera company continued to produce recordings until  between  and  after the company was revived it recorded seven of the operas other recordings have been made by opera companies such as gilbert and sullivan for all and australian opera among many others ad hoc companies of operatic singers conducted by sir malcolm sargent in the s and s and sir charles mackerras in the s have made audio sets of several savoy operas and in the s alexander faris conducted video recordings of most of the operas with casts including showbusiness stars as well as professional singers the longrunning broadway production of the pirates of penzance presented by joseph papp reorchestrated with synthesisers replacing the strings was put on record in  since  the international gilbert and sullivan festival has released numerous professional and amateur cds and videos of its productions and other sullivan recordings sullivans nonsavoy works were infrequently recorded until the s a few of his songs were put on disc in the early years of the th century including versions of the lost chord by enrico caruso and clara butt the first of many recordings of the overture di ballo was made in the s sullivans irish symphony was first recorded in  under sir charles groves since then much of sullivans serious music and his operas without gilbert have been recorded some highlights include the cello concerto by julian lloyd webber  the golden legend under ronald corp  and ivanhoe under the conductor david lloydjones  mackerrass sullivan ballet score pineapple poll has received many recordings since its premiere in  four of them conducted by mackerras in  chandos records released an album songs

mendelssohn in  waited a year to sing the soprano part in his oratorio elijah which he had written for her she finally did so at a concert in  raising £ to fund a scholarship in his name after sullivan became the first recipient of the scholarship lind encouraged him in his career  a few sources stated that sullivan had some jewish ancestry but jacobs concludes that there is no evidence of any jewish antecedents  between  and  sullivan worked as an organist at two fashionable london churches st michaels chester square pimlico and st peters cranley gardens kensington  grove described the discovery thus i found at the bottom of the cupboard and in its farthest corner a bundle of music books two feet high carefully tied round and black with the undisturbed dust of nearly halfacentury  there were the part books of the whole of the music in rosamunde tied up after the second performance in december  and probably never disturbed since dr schneider curator must have been amused at our excitement  at any rate he kindly overlooked it and gave us permission to  copy what we wanted  the work received an enthusiastic public reception but the musical times printed an early example of critical censure of sullivan for his accessibility the applause which it received was general and spontaneous but it may be a question whether if mr sullivan could not be requested to furnish a higher class of work he should not have been passed over altogether until a more fitting opportunity presented itself  this was for the merchant of venice at the princes theatre manchester sullivans earlier tempest music had been composed for the concert hall rather than theatrical performance although it was later used for at least one stage production  with a classical story and a mixture of political satire and grand opera parody thespis was reminiscent of orpheus in the underworld and la belle hélène by offenbach whose operettas were extremely popular on the english stage in both french and english la belle hélène entered the gaietys repertory eight weeks before the premiere of thespis sullivan may have been encouraged to write the music for thespis by hollingsheads offer of the role of apollo to the composers elder brother the comic actor and singer fred sullivan  the musical score of thespis was never published and is now lost except for one song that was published separately a chorus that was reused in the pirates of penzance and the act ii ballet  sullivan composed  hymns including two settings of nearer my god to thee of which the propior deo is the better known young gives a complete list of sullivans hymns  carte conducted cox and box and some operettas on a tour in  managed by the composers brother fred who played cox cox and box again with fred as cox had been revived in  and arthur sullivan may have been considering a return to comic opera  the title page of the libretto describes trial as a dramatic cantata gilbert and sullivan insisted on calling the rest of their joint works operas often with a descriptive adjective such as a nautical comic opera jacobs p  an aesthetic opera or a japanese opera jacobs preface  in a study of the school and its successor the royal college of music david wright comments on sullivan he lacked any fresh perspective on musical training and any vision of what the ntsm needed to achieve if it was to make a mark  neither did sullivan have real sympathy with the society of arts progressive social ideals of scholarship education regardless of social origin despite having himself gained his education through scholarship support  gilbert sullivan and carte tried for many years to control the american performance copyrights over their operas but they were unable to do so  the viennese music critic eduard hanslick wrote of sullivans conducting of a mozart symphony sullivan presides on the podium from the comfortable recesses of a commodious armchair his left arm lazily extended on the armrest his right giving the beat in a mechanical way his eyes fastened on the score  sullivan never looked up from the notes it was as though he was reading at sight the heavenly piece plodded along for better or for worse listlessly insensibly bernard shaw who praised sullivan as a composer they trained him to make europe yawn and he took advantage of their teaching to make london and new york laugh and whistle commented under his bâton orchestras are never deficient in refinement coarseness exaggeration and carelessness are unacquainted with him so unfortunately are vigor and earnestness  gilbert replied it most certainly never occurred to me to look for any other reward than the honour of being associated however remotely and unworthily in a success which i suppose will endure until music itself shall die pray believe that of the many substantial advantages that have resulted to me from our association this last is and always will be the most highly prized  even after gilbert made changes but retained a magic lozenge that changed people into what they pretended to be sullivan could not accept it  the longestrunning piece of musical theatre was robert planquettes  opéracomique les cloches de corneville which held the record until alfred celliers operetta dorothy ran for  performances beginning in   king olaf caractacus and gerontius owe much to the golden legend – as via them does waltons belshazzars feast  gilbert wrote we have a name jointly for humorous work tempered with occasional glimpses of earnest drama i think we should do unwisely if we left altogether the path which we have trodden together so long and so successfully i can quite understand your desire to write a big work well why not write one but why abandon the savoy business cannot the two things be done concurrently if you can write an oratorio like the martyr of antioch while you are occupied by pieces like patience and iolanthe cant you write a grand opera without giving up pieces like the yeomen of the guard  sullivan continued i have lost the necessary nerve for it and it is not too much to say that it is distasteful to me the types used over and over again unavoidable in such a company as ours the grossmith part the middleaged woman with fading charms cannot again be clothed in music by me nor can i again write to any wildly improbable plot in which there is not some human interest  you say that in serious opera you must more or less sacrifice yourself i say that this is just what i have been doing in all our joint pieces and what is more must continue to do in comic opera to make it successful business and syllabic setting assume an importance which however much they fetter me cannot be overlooked i am bound in the interests of the piece to give way hence the reason of my wishing to do a work where the music is to be the first consideration – where words are to suggest music not govern it and where music will intensify and emphasize the emotional effects of the words  sullivans biographers and scholars of his work have censured tennysons text gervase hughes called it puerile rubbish percy young found it devoid of any kind of merit whatsoever sullivans music was initially wellreceived but sullivans biographers were not impressed one of sullivans lamest  resourceless in magic young not even one memorable number jacobs recent critics however have praised sullivans contribution  caryl brahms speculates that sullivans relationship with his friend the duke of edinburgh who was married included sex but the only evidence cited is unspecified victorian cartoonists  one such flirtation was with anna whom he met in paris in   in  fred appeared as cox in his brothers cox and box at the alhambra theatre and he toured as cox in his own production that summer later that year he played apollo in gilbert and sullivans thespis at the gaiety theatre remaining at the gaiety thereafter he took his own company on tour in the summer of  appearing in his brothers cox and box and the contrabandista and later that year he again played cox this time at the gaiety the next year he created the role of the learned judge in gilbert and sullivans trial by jury a role that he would play in london and on tour for the rest of his career  sullivan could also play the oboe and bassoon but less proficiently  gian andrea mazzucato wrote this glowing summary of sullivans career in the musical standard of  december  the english history of the th century could not record the name of a man whose life work is more worthy of honour study and admiration than the name of sir arthur sullivan  it is a debatable point whether the universal history of music can point to any musical personality since the days of haydn mozart and beethoven whose influence is likely to be more lasting than the influence the great englishman is slowly but surely exerting  i make no doubt that when in proper course of time sir arthur sullivans life and works have become known on the continent he will by unanimous consent be classed among the epochmaking composers the select few whose genius and strength of will empowered them to find and found a national school of music that is to endow their countrymen with the undefinable yet positive means of evoking in a mans soul by the magic of sound those delicate nuances of feeling which are characteristic of the emotional power of each different race  fuller maitland was later discredited when it was shown that he had invented a banal lyric passing it off as genuine and condemning sullivan for supposedly setting such inanity in  fuller maitland admitted that he had been wrong in earlier years to dismiss sullivans comic operas as ephemeral  the first was take a pair of sparkling eyes from the

coghlan – english born of irish and italian descent thomas sullivan was based from  to  at the royal military college sandhurst where he was the bandmaster and taught music privately to supplement his income young sullivan became proficient with many of the instruments in the band and had composed an anthem by the waters of babylon by the age of eight he later recalled i was intensely interested in all that the band did and learned to play every wind instrument with which i formed not merely a passing acquaintance but a real lifelong intimate friendship i gradually learned the peculiarities of each  what it could do and what it was unable to do i learned in the best possible way how to write for an orchestra while recognising the boys obvious musical talent his father knew the insecurity of a musical career and discouraged him from pursuing it while studying at a private school in bayswater sullivan then aged  persuaded his parents and the headmaster to allow him to apply for membership in the choir of the chapel royal despite concerns that sullivan at nearly  years of age was too old to give much service as a treble before his voice broke he was accepted and soon became a soloist and by  was promoted to first boy even at this age sullivans health was delicate and he was easily fatigued sullivan flourished under the training of the reverend thomas helmore master of the choristers and began to compose anthems and songs helmore encouraged the young sullivans composing talent and arranged for one of his pieces o israel to be published in  sullivans first published work helmore also enlisted sullivans assistance in creating harmonisations for a volume of the hymnal noted and arranged for sullivans compositions to be performed one of the boys anthems was given at the chapel royal in st jamess palace under the direction of sir george smart mendelssohn scholaredit sullivan at age  in his academy of music uniform in  the royal academy of music awarded the first

studied piano with the head of the academy william sterndale bennett and with arthur oleary during this year at the royal academy sullivan continued to sing solos with the chapel royal which provided a small amount of spending money sullivans scholarship was extended to a second year and in  in what the biographer arthur jacobs calls an extraordinary gesture of confidence the scholarship committee extended his grant for a third year so that he could study in germany at the leipzig conservatoire while there sullivan studied composition with julius rietz and carl reinecke counterpoint with moritz hauptmann and ernst richter and the piano with louis plaidy and ignaz moscheles he was trained in mendelssohns ideas and techniques but was also exposed to a variety of musical styles including schubert verdi bach and wagner visiting a synagoguen  he was so struck by some of the cadences and progressions of the music that thirty years later he could recall them for use in his serious opera ivanhoe though the scholarship was extended to permit sullivan to spend one year in leipzig he stayed for three years there he became friendly with the impresario carl rosa and the violinist joseph joachim for his last year at leipzig his father scraped together the money for living expenses and the conservatoire assisted by waiving its fees sullivan credited his leipzig period with tremendous musical growth his graduation piece completed in  was a set of incidental music to shakespeares the tempest revised and expanded it was performed at the crystal palace in  a year after his return to

burnand richard doyly carte w s gilbert sullivan embarked on his composing career with a series of ambitious works interspersed with hymns parlour songs and other light pieces in a more commercial vein his compositions were not enough to support him financially and from  to  he supplemented his income by working as a church organist which he enjoyed and as a music teacher sometimes at the crystal palace school which he hated and gave up as soon as he couldn  sullivan had an early chance to compose several pieces for royalty in connection with the wedding of the prince of wales in  sullivans association with works for voice and orchestra began with the masque at kenilworth birmingham festival  during a spell as organist at covent garden he composed his first ballet lîle enchantée  in  he premiered his irish symphony and cello concerto his only works in each such genre in the same year his overture in c in memoriam commemorating the recent death of his father was a commission from the norwich festival during his lifetime it achieved considerable popularity in  his overture marmion was premiered by the philharmonic society the times called it another step in advance on the part of the only composer of any remarkable promise that just at present we can boast in the autumn of  sullivan travelled with george grove to vienna in search of neglected manuscript scores by schubert they found and copied several and were particularly excited about their final discovery the score to rosamunden  sullivans first attempt at opera the sapphire necklace – to a libretto by henry f chorley was not produced and is now lost except for the overture and two songs from the work which were separately published his first surviving opera cox and box  was written for a private performance it then received charity performances in london and manchester and was later produced at the gallery of illustration where it ran for an extraordinary  performances w s gilbert writing in fun magazine pronounced the score superior to f c burnands libretto sullivan and burnand were soon commissioned by thomas german reed for a twoact opera the contrabandista  revised and expanded as the chieftain in  but it did not do as well sullivan wrote a group of seven part songs in  the bestknown of which is the long day closes sullivans last major work of the s was a short oratorio the prodigal son premiered in worcester cathedral as part of the  three choirs festival to much praise s first collaborations with gilbertedit early poster showing scenes from the sorcerer hms pinafore and trial by jury sullivans most enduring orchestral work the overture di ballo was composed for the birmingham festival in n  also in  sullivan met gilbert  was a busy year for sullivan he published his only song cycle the window or the songs of the wrens to words by tennyson and he wrote the first of a series of suites of incidental music for west end productions of shakespeare playsn  still in  sullivan composed a dramatic cantata on shore and sea for the opening of the london international exhibition and the hymn onward christian soldiers with words by sabine baringgould the salvation army adopted the latter as its favoured processional and it became sullivans most enduring hymn at the end of  the impresario john hollingshead commissioned sullivan to work with w s gilbert to create the burlesquestyle comic opera thespis for the gaiety theatren  played as a christmas entertainment it ran through to easter  a good run for such a piecen  after thespis gilbert and sullivan went their separate ways until they collaborated on three parlour ballads in late  and early  sullivans largescale works of the early s were the festival te deum crystal palace  and the oratorio the light of the world birmingham festival  he provided suites of incidental music for productions of the merry wives of windsor at the gaiety in  and henry viii at the theatre royal manchester in  he continued to compose hymns throughout the decaden  in  sullivan contributed songs to burnands christmas drawing room extravaganza the miller and his man in  the manager of the royalty theatre richard doyly carte needed a short piece to fill out a bill with offenbachs la périchole carte had conducted sullivans cox and boxn  remembering that gilbert had suggested a libretto to him carte reunited gilbert and sullivan and the result was the oneact comic opera trial by juryn  trial starring sullivans brother fred as the learned judge became a surprise hit earning glowing praise from the critics and playing for  performances over its first few seasons the daily telegraph commented that the piece illustrated the composers great capacity for dramatic writing of the lighter class and other reviews emphasised the felicitous combination of gilberts words and sullivans music one wrote it seems as in the great wagnerian operas as though poem and music had proceeded simultaneously from one and the same brain soon after the opening of trial sullivan wrote the zoo another oneact comic opera with a libretto by b c stephenson but the latter work had only a few short runs and for the next  years sullivans sole operatic collaborator was gilbert the two created an additional  operas together the lost chord  recording of the lost chord  by arthur sullivan and adelaide anne procter sung by reed miller problems playing this file see media help sullivan also turned out more than  popular songs and parlour ballads most of them written before the end of the s his first popular song was orpheus with his lute  and a wellreceived part song was oh hush thee my babie  the best known of his songs is the lost chord  lyrics by adelaide anne procter written in sorrow at the death of his brother frederic the sheet music for his best received songs sold in large numbers and were an important part of his income many of them were adapted as dance pieces in this decade sullivans conducting appointments included the glasgow choral union concerts – and the royal aquarium london  in addition to his appointment as professor of composition at the royal academy of music of which he was a fellow he was appointed as the first principal of the national training school for music in  he accepted the latter post reluctantly fearing that discharging the duties thoroughly would leave too little time for composing in this he was correct as his successor hubert parry also discovered sullivan was not effective in the post and he resigned in n  sullivans next collaboration with gilbert the sorcerer  ran for  performances a success by the standards of the day but hms pinafore  which followed it turned gilbert and sullivan into an international phenomenon the bright and cheerful music of pinafore was composed during a time when sullivan suffered from excruciating pain from a kidney stone pinafore ran for  performances in london the thensecondlongest theatrical run in history and more than  unauthorised productions were quickly mounted in america alonen  among other favourable reviews the times noted that the opera was an early attempt at the establishment of a national musical stage  free from risqué french improprieties and without the aid of italian and german musical models the times and several of the other papers agreed however that while the piece was entertaining sullivan was capable of higher art and frivolous light opera would hold him back this criticism would follow sullivan throughout his career in  sullivan suggested to a reporter from the new york times the secret of his success with gilbert his ideas are as suggestive for music as they are quaint and laughable his numbers  always give me musical ideas pinafore was followed by the pirates of penzance in  another international success which opened in new york and then ran in london for  performances early sedit scenes from the premiere of the golden legend at the leeds music festival  in  sullivan was appointed director of the triennial leeds music festival for his first festival he was commissioned to write a sacred choral work he chose henry hart milmans  dramatic poem based on the life and death of saint margaret the virgin for its basis gilbert adapted the libretto for sullivan the martyr of antioch premiered in october  sullivan was not a showy conductor and some thought him dull and old fashioned on the podiumn  but his composition had an enthusiastic reception and was frequently revived a grateful sullivan presented his collaborator with an engraved silver cup inscribed ws gilbert from his friend arthur sullivann  after the run of the pirates of penzance carte opened the next gilbert and sullivan piece patience in april  at londons opera comique where their past three operas had played in october patience transferred to the new larger stateoftheart savoy theatre built with the profits of the previous gilbert and sullivan works the rest of the partnerships collaborations were produced at the savoy as a result of which they are widely known as the savoy operas iolanthe  gilbert and sullivans fourth hit in a row was the first of the operas to premiere at the new theatre sullivan despite the financial security of writing for the savoy increasingly viewed his work with gilbert as unimportant beneath his skills and also repetitious after iolanthe sullivan had not intended to write a new work with gilbert but he suffered a serious financial loss when his broker went bankrupt in november  therefore he concluded that his financial needs required him to continue writing savoy operas in february  he and gilbert signed a fiveyear agreement with carte requiring them to produce a new comic opera on six months notice on  may  sullivan was knighted by queen victoria for his services  rendered to the promotion of the art of music in britain the musical establishment and many critics believed that this should put an end to his career as a composer of comic opera – that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera having just signed the fiveyear agreement sullivan suddenly felt trapped in middecember he bade farewell to his sisterinlaw charlotte freds widow who emigrated with her young family to america sullivans oldest nephew herbert stayed behind in england as his uncles ward the next opera princess ida  the duos only threeact blank verse work had a noticeably shorter run than its four predecessors although sullivans score was praised with box office receipts lagging in march  carte gave the six months notice under the partnership contract requiring a new opera sullivans close friend the composer frederic clay had suffered a serious stroke in early december  that effectively ended his career at the age of  sullivan reflecting on this on his own longstanding kidney problems and on his desire to devote himself to more serious music replied to carte it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by gilbert and myself programme for the mikado  gilbert had already started work on a new opera involving a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge the composer wrote on  april  that he had come to the end of my tether with the operas i have been continually keeping down the music in order that not one syllable should be lost  i should like to set a story of human interest  probability where the humorous words would come in a humorous not serious situation  where if the situation were a tender or dramatic one the words would be of similar character in a lengthy exchange of correspondence sullivan pronounced gilberts plot sketch particularly the lozenge element unacceptably mechanical and too similar in both its grotesque elements of topsyturveydom and in actual plot to their earlier work especially the sorcerern  and repeatedly requested that gilbert find a new subject the impasse was finally resolved on  may when gilbert proposed a plot that did not depend on any supernatural device the result was gilbert and sullivans most successful work the mikado  the piece ran for  performances which was the secondlongest run for any work of musical theatre and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece up to that timen  later sedit portrait by millais  in the national portrait gallery london it hangs next to frank holls  portrait of gilbert in  sullivan composed his second and last largescale choral work of the decade it was a cantata for the leeds festival the golden legend based on longfellows poem of the same name apart from the comic operas this proved to be sullivans best received fulllength work it was given hundreds of performances during his lifetime and at one point he declared a moratorium on its presentation fearing that it would become overexposed only handels messiah was performed more often in britain in the s and s it remained in the repertory until about the s but since then it has been seldom performed although it received its first professional recording in  the musical scholar and conductor david russell hulme writes that the work influenced elgar and waltonn  ruddigore followed the mikado at the savoy in  it was profitable but its ninemonth run was disappointing compared with most of the earlier savoy operas for their next piece gilbert submitted another version of the magic lozenge plot sullivan immediately rejected it gilbert finally proposed a comparatively serious opera to which sullivan agreed although it was not a grand opera the yeomen of the guard  provided him with the opportunity to compose his most ambitious stage work to date as early as  sullivan had been under pressure from the musical establishment to write a grand opera in  he told an interviewer the opera of the future is a compromise among the french german and italian schools – a sort of eclectic school a selection of the merits of each one i myself will make an attempt to produce a grand opera of this new school  yes it will be an historical work and it is the dream of my life after the yeomen of the guard opened sullivan turned once again to shakespeare composing incidental music for henry irvings production of macbeth  sullivan wished to produce further serious works with gilbert he had collaborated with no other librettist since  but gilbert felt that the reaction to the yeomen of the guard had not been so convincing as to warrant us in assuming that the public want something more earnest still he proposed instead that sullivan should go ahead with his plan to write a grand opera but should continue also to compose comic works for the savoyn  sullivan was not immediately persuaded he replied i have lost the liking for writing comic opera and entertain very grave doubts as to my power of doing itn  nevertheless sullivan soon commissioned a grand opera libretto from julian sturgis who was recommended by gilbert while suggesting to gilbert that he revive an old idea for an opera set in colourful venice the comic opera was completed first the gondoliers  was a piece described by gervase hughes as a pinnacle of sullivans achievement it was the last great gilbert and sullivan success sedit ivanhoe  the relationship between gilbert and sullivan suffered its most serious breach in april  during the run of the gondoliers when gilbert objected to cartes financial accounts for the production including a charge to the partnership for the cost of new carpeting for the savoy theatre lobby gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to carte alone carte was building a new theatre to present sullivans forthcoming grand opera and sullivan sided with carte going so far as to testify erroneously as to certain old debts gilbert took legal action against carte and sullivan and vowed to write no more for the savoy and so the partnership came to an acrimonious end sullivan wrote to gilbert in september  that he was physically and mentally ill over this wretched business i have not yet got over the shock of seeing our names coupled  in hostile antagonism over a few miserable pounds sullivans only grand opera ivanhoe based on walter scotts novel opened at cartes new royal english opera house on  january  sullivan completed the score too late to meet cartes planned production date and costs mounted sullivan was required to pay carte a contractual penalty of £ for his delay the production lasted for  consecutive performances an unprecedented run for a serious opera and earned good notices for its music afterwards carte was unable to fill the new opera house with other opera productions however and ivanhoe was blamed for the failure of the opera house the opera passed into obscurity after a touring revival in – the episode was as the critic herman klein observed the strangest comingling of success and failure ever chronicled in the history of british lyric enterprise sullivan did not seriously consider writing grand opera again later in  sullivan composed music for tennysons the foresters which ran well at dalys theatre in new york in  but failed in london the following yearn  poster for the chieftain  sullivan returned to comic opera but because of the fracture with gilbert he and carte sought other collaborators sullivans next piece was haddon hall  with a libretto by sydney grundy based loosely on the historical elopement of dorothy vernon with john manners although still comic the tone and style of the work was considerably more serious and romantic than most of the operas with gilbert it enjoyed a modest popularity running for  performances and earned critical praise in  sullivan once more provided incidental music for the lyceum this time for j comyns carrs king arthur the partnership with gilbert had been so profitable that carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer eventually succeeding with the help of tom chappell their music publisher their next opera utopia limited  ran for  performances barely covering the expenses of the lavish production although it was the longest run at the savoy in the s sullivan came to disapprove of the leading lady nancy mcintosh and refused to write another piece featuring her while gilbert insisted that she must appear in his next opera instead sullivan teamed up again with his old partner f c burnand the chieftain  a heavily revised version of their earlier twoact opera the contrabandista flopped gilbert and sullivan reunited one more time after mcintosh announced her retirement from the stage for the grand duke  this also failed and sullivan never worked with gilbert again although their operas continued to be revived with success at the savoy in may  sullivans fulllength ballet victoria and merrie england opened at the alhambra theatre to celebrate the queens diamond jubilee the works seven scenes celebrate english history and culture with the victorian period as the grand finale its sixmonth run was considered a great achievement the beauty stone  with a libretto by arthur wing pinero and j comyns carr was based on mediaeval morality plays the collaboration did not go particularly well sullivan wrote that pinero and comyns carr were gifted and brilliant men with no experience in writing for music and when he asked for alterations to improve the structure they refused sullivans score moreover was too serious for the savoy audiences tastes the opera was a critical failure and did not attract a following running for only seven weeks in  to benefit the wives and children of soldiers and sailors on active service in the boer war sullivan composed the music of a jingoistic song the absentminded beggar to a text by rudyard kipling which became an instant sensation and raised an unprecedented £ from performances and the sale of sheet music and related merchandise in the rose of persia  sullivan returned to his comic roots writing to a libretto by basil hood that combined an exotic arabian nights setting with plot elements of the mikado sullivans tuneful score was well received and the opera proved to be his most successful fulllength collaboration apart from those with gilbert another opera with hood the emerald isle quickly went into preparation but sullivan died before it could be completed death honours and legacyedit further information cultural influence of gilbert and sullivan memorial to sullivan victoria embankment gardens london having suffered from longstanding recurrent kidney disease that made it necessary from the s for him to conduct sitting down sullivan died of heart failure following an attack of bronchitis at his flat in london on  november  his unfinished opera the emerald isle was completed by edward german and produced in  his te deum laudamus written to commemorate the end of the boer war was performed posthumously a monument in the composers memory featuring a weeping muse was erected in the victoria embankment gardens in london and is inscribed with gilberts words from the yeomen of the guard is life a boon if so it must befall that death wheneer he call must call too soon sullivan wished to be buried in brompton cemetery with his parents and brother but by order of the queen he was buried in st pauls cathedral in addition to his knighthood honours awarded to sullivan in his lifetime included doctor in music honoris causa by the universities of cambridge  and oxford  chevalier légion dhonneur france  the order of the medjidieh conferred by the sultan of turkey  and appointment as a member of the fourth class of the royal victorian order mvo in  in all sullivans artistic output included  operas  major orchestral works eight choral works and oratorios two ballets one song cycle incidental music to several plays numerous hymns and other church pieces and a large body of songs parlour ballads part songs carols and piano and chamber pieces sullivans operas have often been adapted first in the th century as dance pieces and in foreign adaptations of the operas themselves since then his music has been made into ballets pineapple poll  and pirates of penzance  the ballet  and musicals the swing mikado  the hot mikado  and hot mikado  hollywood pinafore  the black mikado  etc his operas are not only frequently performed but also frequently parodied pastiched quoted and imitated in comedy routines advertising law film television and other popular media his legacy apart from writing the savoy operas and his other works is felt perhaps most strongly today through his influence on the american and british musical theatre the innovations in content and form of the works that he and gilbert developed directly influenced the development of the modern musical throughout the th century in addition biographies and scholarly articles and analyses continue to be written about sullivans life and work personal lifeedit romantic lifeedit fanny ronalds sullivan never married but he had serious love affairs with several womenn  the first was with rachel scott russell – the daughter of the engineer john scott russell sullivan was a frequent visitor at the scott russell home in the mids and by  the affair was in full bloom rachels parents did not approve of a possible union with a young composer with uncertain financial prospects but the two continued to see each other covertly at some point in  sullivan started a simultaneous and secret affair with rachels sister louise – both relationships had ceased by early  sullivans longest love affair was with the american socialite fanny ronalds a woman three years his senior who had two children he met her in paris around  and the affair began in earnest soon after she moved to london permanently in  a contemporary account described fanny ronalds this way her face was perfectly divine in its loveliness her features small and exquisitely regular her hair was a dark shade of brown – châtain foncé deep chestnut – and very abundant  a lovely woman with the most generous smile one could possibly imagine and the most beautiful teeth sullivan called her the best amateur singer in london she often performed sullivans songs at her famous sunday soirees she became particularly associated with the lost chord singing it both in private and in public often with sullivan accompanying her when sullivan died he left her the autograph manuscript of that song along with other bequests ronalds was separated from her american husband but they never divorced social conventions of the time compelled sullivan and ronalds to keep their relationship private in his diary he would refer to her as mrs ronalds when he saw her in a public setting but l w for little woman or d h possibly dear heart when they were alone together often with a number in parentheses indicating the number of sexual acts completed ronalds was apparently pregnant on at least two occasions and procured abortions in  and  sullivan had a roving eye and his diary records the occasional quarrel when ronalds discovered his other liaisons but he always returned to hern  she was a constant companion up to the time of sullivans death but around  or  the sexual relationship seems to have ended he started to refer to her in the diary as auntie and the tick marks indicating sexual activity were no longer there although similar notation continued to be used for his relationships with other women who have not been identified and who were always referred to by their initials in  the yearold sullivan proposed marriage to the yearold violet beddington – but she refused him leisure and family lifeedit sullivan and his nephew herbert bertie sullivan loved to spend time in france both in paris and the south of france where his acquaintances included european royalty and where the casinos enabled him to indulge his passion for

but i never saw anyone so bad as arthur sullivan sullivan was devoted to his parents particularly his mother with whom he corresponded regularly when away from london until her death in  henry lytton wrote i believe there was never a more affectionate tie than that which existed between sullivan and his mother a very witty old lady and one who took an exceptional pride in her sons accomplishments

interviewer arthur lawrence i dont use the piano in composition – that would limit me terribly sullivan explained that his process was not to wait for inspiration but to dig for it  i decide on the rhythm before i come to the question of melody  i mark out the metre in dots and dashes and not until i have quite settled on the rhythm do i proceed to actual notation sullivans text setting compared with that of his th century english predecessors or his european contemporaries was vastly more sensitive  sullivans operatic style attempts to create for itself a uniquely english textmusic synthesis and in addition by adopting a conservative musical style he was able to achieve the clarity to match gilberts finely honed wit with musical wit of his own in composing the savoy operas sullivan wrote the vocal lines of the musical numbers first and these were given to the actors he or an assistant improvised a piano accompaniment at the early rehearsals he wrote the orchestrations later after he had seen what gilberts stage business would be he left the overtures until last and often delegated their composition based on his outlines to his assistants often adding his suggestions or corrections those sullivan wrote himself include thespis iolanthe princess ida the yeomen of the guard the gondoliers the grand duke and probably utopia limited most of the overtures are structured as a potpourri of tunes from the operas in three sections fast slow and fast those for iolanthe and the yeomen of the guard are written in a modified sonata form the overtures from the gilbert and sullivan operas remain popular and there are many recordings of them sullivan invariably conducted the operas on their opening nights in  a review in the times gave this rationale for the continued vitality of the savoy operas they were never really contemporary in their idiom  gilbert and sullivans world was an artificial world with a neatly controlled and shapely precision  for this each partner has his share of credit the neat articulation of incredibilities in gilberts plots is perfectly matched by his language  of equal importance  gilberts lyrics almost invariably take on extra point and sparkle when set to sullivans music  sullivans tunes in these operas also exist in a makebelieve world of their own  he is a delicate wit whose airs have a precision a neatness a grace and a flowing melody melody and rhythmedit the musical times noted that sullivans tunes at least in the comic operas appeal to the professional as much as to the layman his continental contemporaries such as saintsaëns and the viennese critic eduard hanslick held the savoy operas in high regard hughes writes when sullivan wrote what we call a good tune it was nearly always good music as well outside the ranks of the giants there are few other composers of whom the same could be said although his melodies sprang from rhythm some of his themes may have been prompted by his chosen instrumentation or his harmonic techniques favorite airs from the mikado a  edison records recording of selections from the mikado includes parts of the overture a wandring minstrel three little maids titwillow and the act ii finale problems playing this file see media help in the comic operas where many numbers were in verseplusrefrain form sullivan frequently produced two climaxes in the melodic line hughes instances if you go in iolanthe as a good example in hughess view though most of the tunes in the savoy operas are good ones sullivan rarely reached the same class of excellence elsewhere when he had no librettist to feed his imagination even so on those occasions when gilbert wrote in unvaried metre sullivan often followed suit and produced phrases of simple repetition such as love is a plaintive song patience and a man who would woo a fair maid the yeomen of the guard sullivans deliberate echoes of other composers are covered below under musical quotations but other echoes may not have been conscious hughes cites the concluding bars of tell a tale of cock and bull from the yeomen of the guard as an example of handels influence and another critic edward greenfield found a theme in the slow movement of the irish symphony an outrageous crib from schuberts unfinished symphony harmony and counterpointedit sullivans manuscript for act  finale the yeomen of the guard harmonyedit sullivan was trained in the classical style and contemporary music did not greatly attract him harmonically his early works used the conventional formulae of auber donizetti balfe and schubert later he drew on gounod and bizet mendelssohns influence conspicuous in early works appears intermittently in later ones as a contemporary writer observed sullivan draws on these various influences while remaining recognisably himself yet in the field of harmony hughes writes sullivan remained an eclectic he had easily recognisable habits but his style never achieved individuality in general sullivan preferred to write in major keys in the savoy operas there are only eleven substantial numbers wholly in a minor key less than  of the musical numbers and even in his serious works the major prevails examples of sullivans rare excursions into minor keys include the long e minor melody in the first movement of the irish symphony go away madam in the act i finale of iolanthe echoing verdi and beethoven and the funeral march in the act i finale of the yeomen of the guard sullivan was happy on occasion to use chords traditionally considered technically incorrect when reproached for using consecutive fifths in cox and box he replied if ths turn up it doesnt matter so long as there is no offence to the ear hughes comments that harmonic contrast in the savoy works is enhanced by sullivans characteristic modulation between keys as in expressive glances princess ida where he smoothly negotiates e major c sharp minor and c major or then one of us will be a queen the gondoliers where he writes in f major d flat major and d minor both hughes and jacobs in groves dictionary of music and musicians comment adversely on sullivans overuse of tonic pedals usually in the bass which hughes attributes to lack of enterprise or even downright laziness another sullivan trademark criticised by hughes is the repeated use of the chord of the augmented fourth at moments of pathos in his serious works sullivan attempted to avoid harmonic devices associated with the savoy operas with the result according to hughes that the golden legend is a hotchpotch of harmonic styles counterpointedit sullivan as a conductor c  despite his thorough contrapuntal training in london and leipzig as well as his experience as a church organist sullivan rarely composed fugues hughes cites examples from the epilogue to the golden legend and victoria and merrie england in the savoy operas fugal style is reserved for making fun of legal solemnity in trial by jury and iolanthe eg the lord chancellors leitmotif in the latter less formal counterpoint is employed in numbers such as brightly dawns our wedding day the mikado and when the buds are blossoming ruddigore sullivans best known contrapuntal device was the simultaneous presentation of two or more distinct melodies previously heard independently he was not the first composer to combine themes in this way but it became a characteristic feature of the gilbert and sullivan operas sometimes the melodies were for solo voices as in once more the face i loved so well the zoo and i am so proud the mikado which combines three melodic lines other examples are in choruses where typically a graceful tune for the ladies is combined with a robust one for the men examples include when the foeman bares his steel the pirates of penzance in a doleful train patience and welcome gentry ruddigore at other times notably in how beautifully blue the sky the pirates of penzance one theme is given to the chorus and the other to solo voices orchestrationedit gervase hughes concludes his chapter on sullivans orchestration in this vitally important sector of the composers art he deserves to rank as a master sullivan was a competent player of at least four orchestral instruments flute clarinet trumpet and trombone and a technically highly skilled orchestratorn  though sometimes inclined to indulge in grandiosity when writing for a full symphony orchestra he was adept in using smaller forces to the maximum effect percy young writes that orchestral players generally like playing sullivans music sullivan never asked his players to do

cornets  trombones timpani percussion and strings according to geoffrey toye the number of players in sullivans savoy theatre orchestras was a minimum of  sullivan argued hard for an increase in the pit orchestras size and starting with the yeomen of the guard the orchestra was augmented with a second bassoon and a second tenor trombone sullivan generally orchestrated each score at almost the last moment noting that the accompaniment for an opera had to wait until he saw the staging so that he could judge how heavily or lightly to orchestrate each part of the music for his largescale orchestral pieces sullivan added a second oboe part sometimes double bassoon and bass clarinet more horns trumpets tuba and sometimes an organ andor a harp many of these pieces used very large orchestras one of the most recognisable features in sullivans orchestration is his woodwind scoring hughes especially notes sullivans clarinet writing exploiting all registers and colours of the instrument and his particular fondness for oboe solos for instance the irish symphony contains two long solo oboe passages in succession and in the savoy operas there are many shorter examples in the operas and also in concert works another characteristic sullivan touch is his fondness for pizzicato passages for all the string sections most of the operas have at least one number that hughes calls virtually a pizzicato ostinato he instances kind sir you cannot have the heart the gondoliers free from his fetters grim the yeomen of the guard and in vain to us you plead iolanthe musical quotations

imitated mendelssohn for example in his incidental music for the tempest auber in his henry viii music and gounod in the light of the world in his comic operas sullivan followed offenbachs lead in parodying the idioms of french and italian opera such as those of donizetti bellini and verdi his music also shows the influence of handel schubert and conspicuously in the fairy music in iolanthe

reputation has undergone extreme changes since he first came to prominence in the s at first critics were struck by his potential and he was hailed as the longawaited great english composer his incidental music to the tempest received an acclaimed premiere at the crystal palace just before sullivans th birthday in april  the athenaeum wrote it  may mark an epoch in english music or we shall be greatly disappointed years on years have elapsed since we have heard a work by so young an artist so full of promise so full of fancy showing so much conscientiousness so much skill and so few references to any model elect his irish symphony of  won similarly enthusiastic praise but as arthur jacobs notes the first rapturous outburst of enthusiasm for sullivan as an orchestral composer did not last a comment typical of those that followed him throughout his career was that sullivans unquestionable talent should make him doubly careful not to mistake popular applause for artistic appreciation when sullivan turned to comic opera with gilbert the serious critics began to express disapproval peter gammond writes of misapprehensions and prejudices delivered to our door by the victorian firm musical snobs ltd  frivolity and high spirits were sincerely seen as elements that could not be exhibited by anyone who was to be admitted to the sanctified society of art as early as  the figaro wrote that sullivan has all the ability to make him a great composer but he wilfully throws his opportunity away  he possesses all the natural ability to have given us an english opera and instead he affords us a little moreorless excellent fooling few critics denied the excellence of sullivans theatre scores the theatre wrote that iolanthe sustains dr sullivans reputation as the most spontaneous fertile and scholarly composer of comic opera this country has ever produced however comic opera no matter how skilfully crafted was viewed as an intrinsically lower form of art than oratorio the athenaeums review of the martyr of antioch declared it is an advantage to have the composer of hms pinafore occupying himself with a worthier form of art knighthood and later yearsedit sullivans knighthood in  gave the serious music critics further ammunition the musical review of that year wrote some things that mr arthur sullivan may do sir arthur ought not to do in other words it will look rather more than odd to see announced in the papers that a new comic opera is in preparation the book by mr w s gilbert and the music by sir arthur sullivan a musical knight can hardly write shop ballads either he must not dare to soil his hands with anything less than an anthem or a madrigal oratorio in which he has so conspicuously shone and symphony must now be his line here is not only an opportunity but a positive obligation for him to return to the sphere from which he has too long descended and do battle for the honour of english art  against all foreign rivals and arouse us thoroughly from our present halftorpid condition even sullivans friend george grove wrote surely the time has come when so able and experienced a master of voice orchestra and stage effect – master too of so much genuine sentiment – may apply his gifts to a serious opera on some subject of abiding human or natural interest sullivan finally redeemed himself in critical eyes with the golden legend in  the observer hailed it as a triumph of english art the world called it one of the greatest creations we have had for many years original bold inspired grand in conception in execution in treatment it is a composition which will make an epoch and which will carry the name of its composer higher on the wings of fame and glory  the effect of the public performance was unprecedented hopes for a new departure were evident in the daily telegraphs review of the yeomen of the guard  sullivans most serious opera to that point the music follows the book to a higher plane and we have a genuine english opera forerunner of many others let us hope and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage sullivans only wholly serious opera ivanhoe  received generally favourable reviews although j a fuller maitland in the times expressed reservations writing that the operas best portions rise so far above anything else that sir arthur sullivan has given to the world and have such force and dignity that it is not difficult to forget the drawbacks which may be found in the want of interest in much of the choral writing and the brevity of the concerted solo parts sullivans  ballet victoria and merrie england was one of several late pieces that won praise from most critics sir arthur sullivans music is music for the people there is no attempt made to force on the public the dullness of academic experience the melodies are all as fresh as last years wine and as exhilarating as sparkling champagne there is not one tune which tires the hearing and in the matter of orchestration our only humorist has let himself run riot not being handicapped with libretto and the gain is enormous  all through we have orchestration of infinite delicacy tunes of alarming simplicity but never a tinge of vulgarity although the more solemn members of the musical establishment could not forgive sullivan for writing music that was both comic and accessible he was nevertheless the nations de facto composer laureaten  posthumous reputationedit in the decade after his death sullivans reputation sank considerably in  fuller maitland took issue with the generally laudatory tone of most of the obituaries is there anywhere a case quite parallel to that of sir arthur sullivan who began his career with a work which at once stamped him as a genius and to the height of which he only rarely attained throughout life  it is because such great natural gifts – gifts greater perhaps than fell to any english musician since  purcell – were so very seldom employed in work worthy of them edward elgar to whom sullivan had been particularly kind rose to sullivans defence branding fuller maitlands obituary the shady side of musical criticism  that foul unforgettable episoden  fuller maitlands followers including ernest walker also dismissed sullivan as merely the idle singer of an empty evening as late as  frank howes music critic of the times condemned sullivan for a lack of sustained effort  a fundamental lack of seriousness towards his art and inability to perceive the smugness the sentimentality and banality of the mendelssohnian detritus  to remain content with the flattest and most obvious rhythms this yielding to a fatal facility that excludes sullivan from the ranks of the good composers th century audiences thomas f dunhill wrote in  that sullivans music has suffered in an extraordinary degree from the vigorous attacks which have been made upon it in professional circles these attacks have succeeded in surrounding the composer with a kind of barricade of prejudice which must be swept away before justice can be done to his genius sir henry wood continued to perform sullivans serious music in  wood presented a sullivan centenary concert at the royal albert hall but it was not until the s that sullivans music other than the savoy operas began to be widely revived and reassessed in  hughes published the first fulllength book about sullivans music which while taking note of his weaknesses which are many and not hesitating to castigate his lapses from good taste which were comparatively rare attempted to view them in perspective against the wider background of his sound musicianship the work of the sir arthur sullivan society founded in  books about sullivan by musicians such as young  and jacobs  and a growing number of recordings have contributed to the reevaluation of sullivans serious music the symphony in e had its first professional recording in  and a considerable number of sullivans nongilbert works have since been recorded scholarly critical editions of a growing number of sullivans works have been published in a  article in the musical times nigel burton wrote sullivan spoke naturally to all people for all time of the passions sorrows and joys which are forever rooted in the human consciousness he believed  that the human beings prime duty in life is to serve humanity it is his artistic consistency in this respect which obliges us to pronounce him our greatest victorian composer time has now sufficiently dispersed the mists of criticism for us to be able to see the truth to enjoy all

most certainly never occurred to me to look for any other reward than the honour of being associated however remotely and unworthily in a success which i suppose will endure until music itself shall die pray believe that of the many substantial advantages that have resulted to me from our association this last is and always will be the most highly prized  even after gilbert made changes but

we have trodden together so long and so successfully i can quite understand your desire to write a big work well why not write one but why abandon the savoy business cannot the two things be done concurrently if you can write an oratorio like the martyr of antioch while you are occupied by pieces like patience and iolanthe cant you write a grand opera without giving up pieces like the yeomen of the guard  sullivan continued i have lost the necessary nerve for it and it is not too much to say that it is distasteful to me the types used over and over again unavoidable in such a company as ours the grossmith part the middleaged woman with fading charms cannot again be clothed in music by me nor can i again write to any wildly improbable plot in which there is not some human interest  you say that in serious opera you must more or less sacrifice yourself i say that this is just what i have been doing in all our joint pieces and what is more must continue to do in comic opera to make it successful business and syllabic setting assume an importance which however much they fetter me cannot be overlooked i am bound in the interests of the piece to give way hence the reason of my

coghlan – english born of irish and italian descent thomas sullivan was based from  to  at the royal military college sandhurst where he was the bandmaster and taught music privately to supplement his income young sullivan became proficient with many of the instruments in the band and had composed an anthem by the waters of babylon by the age of eight he later recalled i was intensely interested in all that the band did and learned to play every wind instrument with which i formed not merely a passing acquaintance but a real lifelong intimate friendship i gradually learned the peculiarities of each  what it could do and what it was unable to do i learned in the best possible way how to write for an orchestra while recognising the boys obvious musical talent his father knew the insecurity of a musical career and discouraged him from pursuing it while studying at a private school in bayswater sullivan then aged  persuaded his parents and the headmaster to allow him to apply for membership in the choir of the chapel royal despite concerns that sullivan at nearly  years of age was too old to give much service as a treble before his voice broke he was accepted and soon became a soloist and by  was promoted to first boy even at this age sullivans health was delicate and he was easily fatigued sullivan flourished under the training of the reverend thomas helmore master of the choristers and began to compose anthems and songs helmore encouraged the young sullivans composing talent and arranged for one of his pieces o israel to be published in  sullivans first published work helmore also enlisted sullivans assistance in creating harmonisations for a volume of the hymnal noted and arranged for sullivans compositions to be performed one of the boys anthems was given at the

a small amount of spending money sullivans scholarship was extended to a second year and in  in what the biographer arthur jacobs calls an extraordinary gesture of confidence the scholarship committee extended his grant for a third year so that he could study in germany at the leipzig conservatoire while there sullivan studied composition with julius rietz and carl reinecke counterpoint with moritz hauptmann and ernst richter and the piano with louis plaidy and ignaz moscheles he was trained in mendelssohns ideas and techniques but was also exposed to a variety of musical styles including schubert verdi bach and wagner visiting a synagoguen  he was so struck by some of the cadences and progressions of the music that thirty years later he could recall them for use in his serious opera ivanhoe though the scholarship was extended to permit sullivan to spend one year in leipzig he stayed for three years there he became friendly with the impresario carl rosa and the violinist joseph joachim for his last year at leipzig his father scraped together the money for living expenses and the conservatoire assisted by waiving its fees sullivan credited his leipzig period with tremendous

praise from the critics and playing for  performances over its first few seasons the daily telegraph commented that the piece illustrated the composers great capacity for dramatic writing of the lighter class and other reviews emphasised the felicitous combination of gilberts words and sullivans music one wrote it seems as in the great wagnerian operas as though poem and music had proceeded simultaneously from one and the same brain soon after the opening of trial sullivan wrote the zoo another oneact comic opera with a libretto by b c stephenson but the latter work had only a few short

sorrow at the death of his brother frederic the sheet music for his best received songs sold in large numbers and were an important part of his income many of them were adapted as dance pieces in this decade sullivans conducting appointments included the glasgow choral union concerts – and the royal aquarium london  in addition to his appointment as professor of composition at the royal academy of music of which he was a fellow he was appointed as the first principal of the national training school for music in  he accepted the latter post reluctantly fearing that discharging the duties thoroughly would leave too little time for composing in this he was correct as his successor hubert parry also discovered sullivan was not effective in the post and he resigned in n  sullivans next collaboration with gilbert the sorcerer  ran for  performances a success by the standards of the day but hms pinafore  which followed it turned gilbert and sullivan into an international phenomenon the bright and cheerful music of pinafore was composed during a time when sullivan suffered from excruciating pain from a kidney stone pinafore ran for  performances in london the thensecondlongest theatrical run in history and more than  unauthorised productions were quickly mounted in america alonen  among other favourable reviews the times noted that the opera was an early attempt at the establishment of a national musical stage  free from risqué french improprieties and without the aid of italian and german musical models the times and several of the other papers agreed however that while the piece was entertaining sullivan was capable of higher art and frivolous light opera would hold him back this criticism would follow sullivan throughout his career in  sullivan suggested to a reporter from the new york times the secret of his success with gilbert his ideas are as suggestive for music as they are quaint and laughable his numbers  always give me musical ideas pinafore was

leeds music festival  in  sullivan was appointed director of the triennial leeds music festival for his first festival he was commissioned to write a sacred choral work he chose henry hart milmans  dramatic poem based on the life and death of saint margaret the virgin for its basis gilbert adapted the libretto for sullivan the martyr of antioch premiered in october  sullivan was not a showy conductor and some thought him dull and old fashioned on the podiumn  but his composition had an enthusiastic reception and was frequently revived a grateful sullivan presented his collaborator with

the rest of the partnerships collaborations were produced at the savoy as a result of which they are widely known as the savoy operas iolanthe  gilbert and sullivans fourth hit in a row was the first of the operas to premiere at the new theatre sullivan despite the financial security of writing for the savoy increasingly viewed his work with gilbert as unimportant beneath his skills and also repetitious after iolanthe sullivan had not intended to write a new work with gilbert but he suffered a serious financial loss when his broker went bankrupt in november  therefore he concluded that his financial needs required him to continue writing savoy operas in february  he and gilbert signed a fiveyear agreement with carte requiring them to produce a new comic opera on six months notice on  may  sullivan was knighted by queen victoria for his services  rendered to the promotion of the art of music in britain the musical establishment and many critics believed that this should put an end to his career as a composer of comic opera – that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera having just signed the fiveyear agreement sullivan suddenly felt trapped in middecember he bade farewell to his sisterinlaw charlotte freds widow who emigrated with her young family to america sullivans oldest nephew herbert stayed behind in england as his uncles ward the

effectively ended his career at the age of  sullivan reflecting on this on his own longstanding kidney problems and on his desire to devote himself to more serious music replied to carte it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by gilbert and myself programme for the mikado  gilbert had already started work on a new opera involving a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge the composer wrote on  april  that he had come to the end of my tether with the operas i have been continually keeping down the music in order that not one syllable should be lost  i should like to set a story of human interest  probability where the humorous words would come in a humorous not serious situation  where if the situation were a tender or dramatic one the words would be of similar character in a lengthy exchange of correspondence sullivan pronounced gilberts plot sketch particularly the lozenge element unacceptably mechanical and too similar in both its grotesque elements of topsyturveydom and in actual plot to their earlier work especially the sorcerern  and repeatedly requested that gilbert find a new subject the impasse was finally resolved on  may when gilbert proposed a plot that did not depend on any supernatural device the result was gilbert and sullivans most successful work the mikado  the piece ran for  performances which was the secondlongest run for any work of musical theatre and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece up to that timen  later sedit portrait by millais  in the national portrait gallery london it hangs next to frank holls  portrait of gilbert in  sullivan composed his second and last largescale choral work of the decade it was a cantata for the leeds festival the golden legend based on longfellows poem of the same name apart from the comic operas this proved to be sullivans best received fulllength work it was given hundreds of performances during his lifetime and at one point he declared a moratorium on its presentation fearing that it would become overexposed only handels messiah was performed more often in britain in the s and s it remained in the repertory until about the s but since then it has been seldom performed although it received its first professional recording in  the musical scholar and conductor david russell hulme writes that the work influenced elgar and waltonn  ruddigore followed the mikado at the savoy in  it was profitable but its ninemonth run was disappointing compared with most of the earlier savoy operas for their next piece gilbert submitted another version of the magic lozenge plot sullivan immediately rejected it gilbert finally proposed a comparatively serious opera to which sullivan agreed although it was not a grand opera the yeomen of the guard  provided him with the opportunity to compose his most ambitious stage work to date as early as  sullivan had been under pressure from the musical establishment to write a grand opera in  he told an interviewer the opera of the future is a compromise among the french german and italian schools – a sort of eclectic school a selection of the merits of each one i myself will make an attempt to produce a grand opera of this new school  yes it will be an historical work and it is the dream of my life after the yeomen of the guard opened sullivan turned once again to shakespeare composing incidental music for henry irvings production of macbeth  sullivan wished to produce further serious works with gilbert he had collaborated with no other librettist since  but gilbert felt that the reaction to the yeomen of the guard had not been so convincing as to warrant us in assuming that the public want something more earnest still he proposed instead that sullivan should go ahead with his plan to write a grand opera but should continue also to compose comic works for the savoyn  sullivan was not immediately persuaded he replied i have lost the liking for writing comic opera and entertain very grave doubts as to my power of doing itn  nevertheless sullivan soon commissioned a grand opera libretto from julian sturgis who was recommended by gilbert while suggesting to gilbert that he revive an old idea for an opera set in colourful venice the comic opera was completed first the gondoliers  was a piece described by gervase hughes as a pinnacle of sullivans achievement it was the last great gilbert and sullivan success sedit ivanhoe  the relationship between gilbert and sullivan suffered its most serious breach in april  during the run of the gondoliers when gilbert objected to cartes financial accounts for the production including a charge to the partnership for the cost of new carpeting for the savoy theatre lobby gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to carte alone carte was building a new theatre to present sullivans forthcoming grand opera and sullivan sided with carte going so far as to testify erroneously as to certain old debts gilbert took legal action against carte and sullivan and vowed to write no more for the savoy and so the partnership came to an acrimonious end sullivan wrote to gilbert in september  that he was physically and mentally ill over this wretched business i have not yet got over the shock of seeing our names coupled  in hostile antagonism over a few miserable pounds sullivans only grand opera ivanhoe based on walter scotts novel opened at cartes new royal english opera house on  january  sullivan completed the score too late to meet cartes planned production date and costs mounted sullivan was required to pay carte a contractual penalty of £ for his delay the production lasted for  consecutive performances an unprecedented run for a serious opera and earned good notices for its music afterwards carte was unable to fill the new opera house with other opera productions however and ivanhoe was blamed for the failure of the opera house the opera passed into obscurity after a touring revival in – the episode was as the critic herman klein observed the strangest comingling of success and failure ever chronicled in the history of british lyric enterprise sullivan did not seriously consider writing grand opera again later in  sullivan composed music for tennysons the foresters which ran well at dalys theatre in new york in  but failed in london the following yearn  poster for the chieftain  sullivan returned to comic opera but because of the fracture with gilbert he and carte sought other collaborators sullivans next piece was haddon hall  with a libretto by sydney grundy based loosely on the historical elopement of dorothy vernon with john manners although still comic the tone and style of the work was considerably more serious and romantic than most of the operas with gilbert it enjoyed a modest popularity running for  performances and earned critical praise in  sullivan once more provided incidental music for the lyceum this time for j comyns carrs king arthur the partnership with gilbert had been so profitable that carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer eventually succeeding with the help of tom chappell their music publisher their next opera utopia limited  ran for  performances barely covering the expenses of the lavish production although it was the longest run at the savoy in the s sullivan came to disapprove of the leading lady nancy mcintosh and refused to write another piece featuring her while gilbert insisted that she must appear in his next opera instead sullivan teamed up again with his old partner f c burnand the chieftain  a heavily revised version of their earlier twoact opera the contrabandista flopped gilbert and sullivan reunited one more time after mcintosh announced her retirement from the stage for the grand duke  this also failed and sullivan never worked with gilbert again although their operas continued to be revived with success at the savoy in may  sullivans fulllength ballet victoria and merrie england opened at the alhambra theatre to celebrate the queens diamond jubilee the works seven scenes celebrate english history and culture with the victorian period as the grand finale its sixmonth run was considered a great achievement the beauty stone  with a libretto by arthur wing pinero and j comyns carr was based on mediaeval morality plays the collaboration did not go particularly well sullivan wrote that pinero and comyns carr were gifted and brilliant men with no experience in writing for music and when he asked for alterations to improve the structure they refused sullivans score moreover was too serious for the savoy audiences tastes the opera was a critical failure and did not attract a following running for only seven weeks in  to benefit the wives and children of soldiers and sailors on active service in the boer war sullivan composed the music of a jingoistic song the absentminded beggar to a text by rudyard kipling which became an instant sensation and raised an unprecedented £ from performances and the sale of sheet music and related merchandise in the rose of persia  sullivan returned to his comic roots writing to a libretto by basil hood that combined an exotic arabian nights setting with plot elements of the mikado sullivans tuneful score was well received and the opera proved to be his most successful fulllength collaboration apart from those with gilbert another opera with hood the emerald isle quickly went into preparation but sullivan died

operas are not only frequently performed but also frequently parodied pastiched quoted and imitated in comedy routines advertising law film television and other popular media his legacy apart from writing the savoy operas and his other works is felt perhaps most strongly today through his influence on the american and british musical theatre the innovations in content and form of the works that

the most beautiful teeth sullivan called her the best amateur singer in london she often performed sullivans songs at her famous sunday soirees she became particularly associated with the lost chord singing it both in private and in public often with sullivan accompanying her when sullivan died he left her the autograph manuscript of that song along with other bequests ronalds was separated from

interviewer arthur lawrence i dont use the piano in composition – that would limit me terribly sullivan explained that his process was not to wait for inspiration but to dig for it  i decide on the rhythm before i come to the question of melody  i mark out the metre in dots and dashes and not until i have quite settled on the rhythm do i proceed to actual notation sullivans text setting compared with that of his th century english predecessors or his european contemporaries was vastly more sensitive  sullivans operatic style attempts to create for itself a uniquely english textmusic synthesis and in addition by adopting a conservative musical style he was able to achieve the clarity to match gilberts finely honed wit with musical wit of his own in composing the savoy operas sullivan wrote the vocal lines of the musical numbers first and these were given to the actors he or an assistant improvised a piano accompaniment at the early rehearsals he wrote the orchestrations later after he had seen what gilberts stage business would be he left the overtures until last and often delegated their composition based on his outlines to his assistants often adding his suggestions or corrections those sullivan wrote himself include thespis iolanthe princess ida the yeomen of the guard the gondoliers the grand duke and probably utopia limited most of the overtures are structured as a potpourri of tunes from the operas in three sections fast slow and fast those for iolanthe and the yeomen of the guard are written in a modified sonata form the overtures from the gilbert and sullivan operas remain popular and there are many recordings of them sullivan invariably conducted the operas on their opening nights in  a review in the times gave this rationale for the continued vitality of the savoy operas they were never really contemporary in their idiom  gilbert and sullivans world was an artificial world with a neatly controlled and shapely precision  for this each partner has his share of credit the neat articulation of incredibilities in gilberts plots is perfectly matched by his language  of equal importance  gilberts lyrics almost invariably take on extra point and sparkle when set to sullivans music  sullivans tunes in these operas also exist in a makebelieve world of their own  he is a delicate wit whose airs have a precision a neatness a grace and a flowing melody melody and rhythmedit the musical times noted that sullivans tunes at least in the comic operas appeal to the professional as much as to the layman his continental contemporaries such as saintsaëns and the viennese critic eduard hanslick held the savoy operas in high regard hughes writes when sullivan wrote what we call a good tune it was nearly always good music as well outside the ranks of the giants there are few other composers of whom the same could be said although his melodies sprang from rhythm some of his themes may have been prompted by his chosen instrumentation or his harmonic techniques favorite airs from the mikado a  edison records recording of selections from the mikado includes parts of the overture a wandring minstrel three little maids titwillow and the act ii finale problems playing this file see media help in the comic operas where many numbers were in verseplusrefrain form sullivan frequently produced two climaxes in the melodic line hughes instances if you go in iolanthe as a good example in hughess view though most of the tunes in the savoy operas are good ones sullivan rarely reached the same class of excellence elsewhere when he had no librettist to feed his imagination even so on those occasions when gilbert wrote in unvaried metre sullivan often followed suit and produced phrases of simple repetition such as love is a plaintive song patience and a man who would woo a fair maid the yeomen of the guard sullivans deliberate echoes of other composers are covered below under musical quotations but other echoes may not have been conscious hughes cites the concluding bars of tell a tale of cock and bull from the yeomen of the guard as an example of handels influence and another critic edward greenfield found a theme in the slow movement of the irish symphony an outrageous crib from schuberts unfinished symphony harmony and counterpointedit sullivans manuscript for act  finale the yeomen of the guard harmonyedit sullivan was trained in the classical style and contemporary music did not greatly attract him harmonically his early works used the conventional formulae of auber donizetti balfe and schubert later he drew on gounod and bizet mendelssohns influence conspicuous in early works appears intermittently in later ones as a contemporary writer observed sullivan draws on these various influences while remaining recognisably himself yet in the field of harmony hughes writes sullivan remained an eclectic he had easily recognisable habits but his style never achieved individuality in general sullivan preferred to write in major keys in the savoy operas there are only eleven substantial numbers wholly in a minor key less than  of the musical numbers and even in his serious works the major prevails examples of sullivans rare excursions into minor keys include the long e minor melody in the first movement of the irish symphony go away madam in the act i finale of iolanthe echoing verdi and beethoven and the funeral march in the act i finale of the yeomen of the guard sullivan was happy on occasion to use chords traditionally considered technically incorrect when reproached for using consecutive fifths in cox and box he replied if ths turn up it doesnt matter so long as there is no offence to the ear hughes comments that harmonic contrast in the savoy works is enhanced by sullivans characteristic modulation between keys as in expressive glances princess ida where he smoothly negotiates e major c sharp minor and c major or then one of us will be a queen the gondoliers where he writes in f major d flat major and d minor both hughes and jacobs in groves dictionary of music and musicians comment adversely on sullivans overuse of tonic pedals usually in the bass which hughes attributes to lack of enterprise or even downright laziness another sullivan trademark criticised by hughes is the repeated use of the chord of the augmented fourth at moments of pathos in his serious works sullivan attempted to avoid harmonic devices associated with the savoy operas with the result according to hughes that the golden legend is a hotchpotch of harmonic styles counterpointedit sullivan as a conductor c  despite his thorough contrapuntal training in london and leipzig as well as his experience as a church organist sullivan rarely composed fugues hughes cites examples from the epilogue to the golden legend and victoria and merrie england in the savoy operas fugal style is reserved for making fun of legal solemnity in trial by jury and iolanthe eg the lord chancellors leitmotif in the latter less formal counterpoint is employed in numbers such as brightly dawns our wedding day the mikado and when the buds are blossoming ruddigore sullivans best known contrapuntal device was the simultaneous presentation of two or more distinct melodies previously heard independently he was not the first composer to combine themes in this way but it became a characteristic feature of the gilbert and sullivan operas sometimes the melodies were for solo voices as in once more the face i loved so well the zoo and i am so proud the mikado which combines three melodic lines other examples are in choruses where typically a graceful tune for the ladies is combined with a robust one for the men examples include when the foeman bares his steel the pirates of penzance in a doleful train patience and welcome gentry ruddigore at other times notably in how beautifully blue the sky the pirates of penzance one theme is given to the chorus and the other to solo voices orchestrationedit gervase hughes concludes his chapter on sullivans orchestration in this vitally important sector of the composers art he deserves to rank as a master sullivan was a competent player of at least four orchestral instruments flute clarinet trumpet and trombone and a technically highly skilled orchestratorn  though sometimes inclined to indulge in grandiosity when writing for a full symphony orchestra he was adept in using smaller forces to the maximum effect percy young writes that orchestral players generally like playing sullivans music sullivan never asked his players to do

cornets  trombones timpani percussion and strings according to geoffrey toye the number of players in sullivans savoy theatre orchestras was a minimum of  sullivan argued hard for an increase in the pit orchestras size and starting with the yeomen of the guard the orchestra was augmented with a second bassoon and a second tenor trombone sullivan generally orchestrated each score at almost the last moment noting that the accompaniment for an opera had to wait until he saw the staging so that he could judge how heavily or lightly to orchestrate each part of the music for his largescale orchestral pieces sullivan added a second oboe part sometimes double bassoon and bass clarinet more horns trumpets tuba and sometimes an organ andor a harp many of these pieces used very large orchestras one of the most recognisable features in sullivans orchestration is his woodwind scoring hughes especially notes sullivans clarinet writing exploiting all registers and colours of the instrument and his particular fondness for oboe solos for instance the irish symphony contains two long solo oboe passages in succession and in the savoy operas there are many shorter examples in the operas and also in concert works another characteristic sullivan touch is his fondness for pizzicato passages for all the string sections most of the operas have at least one number that hughes calls virtually a pizzicato ostinato he instances kind sir you cannot have the heart the gondoliers free from his fetters grim the yeomen of the guard and in vain to us you plead iolanthe musical quotations

friends from trial by jury that summarised sullivans career to that date   a humorous knight it is reported that after the leeds festival dr sullivan will be knighted having read this in a column of gossip a benighted contributor who has the judges song on the brain suggests the following verse adapted to probabilities as a boy i had such a musical bump     and its size so struck mr helmore that he said though you sing those songs like a trump     you shall write some yourself that will sell more so i packed off to leipsic without looking back     and returned in such classical fury that i

next first night and the opéra c     lets hope if youre able to find him youll cry from the pit theres w s g     in the stalls—with a knight behind him early receptionedit sullivans critical reputation has undergone extreme changes since he first came to prominence in the s at first critics were struck by his potential and he was hailed as the longawaited great english composer his incidental music to the tempest received an acclaimed premiere at the crystal palace just before sullivans th birthday in april  the athenaeum wrote it  may mark an epoch in english music or we shall be greatly disappointed years on years have elapsed since we have heard a work by so young an artist so full of promise so full of fancy showing so much conscientiousness so much skill and so few references to any model elect his irish symphony of  won similarly enthusiastic praise but as arthur jacobs notes the first rapturous outburst of enthusiasm for sullivan as an orchestral composer did not last a comment typical of those that followed him throughout his career was that sullivans unquestionable talent should make him doubly careful not to mistake popular applause for artistic appreciation when sullivan turned to comic opera with gilbert the serious critics began to express disapproval peter gammond writes of misapprehensions and prejudices delivered to our door by the victorian firm musical snobs ltd  frivolity and high spirits were sincerely seen as elements that could not be exhibited by anyone who was to be admitted to the sanctified society of art as early as  the figaro wrote that sullivan has all the ability to make him a great composer but he wilfully throws his opportunity away  he possesses all the natural ability to have given us an english opera and instead he affords us a little moreorless excellent fooling few critics denied the excellence of sullivans theatre scores the theatre wrote that iolanthe sustains dr sullivans reputation as the most spontaneous fertile and scholarly composer of comic opera this country has ever produced however comic opera no matter how skilfully crafted was viewed as an intrinsically lower form of art than oratorio the athenaeums review of the martyr of antioch declared it is an advantage to have the composer of hms pinafore occupying himself with a worthier form of art knighthood and later yearsedit sullivans knighthood in  gave the serious music critics further ammunition the musical review of that year wrote some things that mr arthur sullivan may do sir arthur ought not to do in other words it will look rather more than odd to see announced in the papers that a new comic opera is in preparation the book by mr w s gilbert and the music by sir arthur sullivan a musical knight can hardly write shop ballads either he must not dare to soil his hands with anything less than an anthem or a madrigal oratorio in which he has so conspicuously shone and symphony must now be his line here is not only an opportunity but a positive obligation for him to return to the sphere from which he has too long descended and do battle for the honour of english art  against all foreign rivals and arouse us thoroughly from our present halftorpid condition even sullivans friend george grove wrote surely the time has come when so able and experienced a master of voice orchestra and stage effect – master too of so much genuine sentiment – may apply his gifts to a serious opera on some subject of abiding human or natural interest sullivan finally redeemed himself in critical eyes with the golden legend in  the observer hailed it as a triumph of english art the world called it one of the greatest creations we have had for many years original bold inspired grand in conception in execution in treatment it is a composition which will make an epoch and which will carry the name of its composer higher on the wings of fame and glory  the effect of the public performance was unprecedented hopes for a new departure were evident in the daily telegraphs review of the yeomen of the guard  sullivans most serious opera to that point the music follows the book to a higher plane and we have a genuine english opera forerunner of many others let us hope and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage sullivans only wholly serious opera ivanhoe  received generally favourable reviews although j a fuller maitland in the times expressed reservations writing that the operas best portions rise so far above anything else that sir arthur sullivan has given to the world and have such force and dignity that it is not difficult to forget the drawbacks which may be found in the want of interest in much of the choral writing and the brevity of the concerted solo parts sullivans  ballet victoria and merrie england was one of several late pieces that won praise from most critics sir arthur sullivans music is music for the people there is no attempt made to force on the public the dullness of academic experience the melodies are all as fresh as last years wine and as exhilarating as sparkling champagne there is not one tune which tires the hearing and in the matter of orchestration our only humorist has let himself run riot not being handicapped with libretto and the gain is enormous  all through we have orchestration of infinite delicacy tunes of alarming simplicity but never a tinge of vulgarity although the more solemn members of the musical establishment could not forgive sullivan for writing music that was both comic and accessible he was nevertheless the nations de facto composer laureaten  posthumous reputationedit in the decade after his death sullivans reputation sank considerably in  fuller maitland took issue with the generally laudatory tone of most of the obituaries is there anywhere a case quite parallel to that of sir arthur sullivan who began his career with a work which at once stamped him as a genius and to the height of which he only rarely attained throughout life  it is because such great natural gifts – gifts greater perhaps than fell to any english musician since  purcell – were so very seldom employed in work worthy of them edward elgar to whom sullivan had been particularly kind rose to sullivans defence branding fuller maitlands obituary the shady side of musical criticism  that foul unforgettable episoden  fuller maitlands followers including ernest walker also dismissed sullivan as merely the idle singer of an empty evening as late as  frank howes music critic of the times condemned sullivan for a lack of sustained effort  a fundamental lack of seriousness towards his art and inability to perceive the smugness the sentimentality and banality of the mendelssohnian detritus  to remain content with the flattest and most obvious rhythms this yielding to a fatal facility that excludes sullivan from the ranks of the good composers th century audiences thomas f dunhill wrote in  that sullivans music has suffered in an extraordinary degree from the vigorous attacks which have been made upon it in professional circles these attacks have succeeded in surrounding the composer with a kind of barricade of prejudice which must be swept away before justice can be done to his genius sir henry wood continued to perform sullivans serious music in  wood presented a sullivan centenary concert at the royal albert hall but it was not until the s that sullivans music other than the savoy operas began to be widely revived and reassessed in  hughes published the first fulllength book about sullivans music which while taking note of his weaknesses which are many and not hesitating to castigate his lapses from good taste which were comparatively rare attempted to view them in perspective against the wider background of his sound musicianship the work of the sir arthur sullivan society founded in  books about sullivan by musicians such as young  and jacobs  and a growing number of recordings have contributed to the reevaluation of sullivans serious music the symphony in e had its first professional recording in  and a considerable number of sullivans nongilbert works have since been recorded scholarly critical editions of a growing number of sullivans works have been published in a  article in the musical times nigel burton wrote sullivan spoke naturally to all people for all time of the passions sorrows and joys which are forever rooted in the human consciousness he believed  that the human beings prime duty in life is to serve humanity it is his artistic consistency in this respect which obliges us to pronounce him our greatest victorian composer time has now sufficiently dispersed the mists of criticism for us to be able to see the truth to enjoy all his music and to rejoice in the rich diversity of its panoply  let us resolve to set aside the oneandahalfhurrahs syndrome once and for all and in its place raise three loud cheers recordingsedit on  august  george gouraud introduced thomas edisons phonograph to london in a press conference including the playing of a piano and cornet recording of sullivans the lost chord one of the first recordings of music ever made sullivan was invited to a party on  october  given to demonstrate the technology after dinner he recorded a speech to be sent to edison saying in part i can only say that i am astonished and somewhat terrified at the result of this evenings experiments astonished at the wonderful power you have developed and terrified at the thought that so much hideous and bad music may be put on record forever but all the same i think it is the most wonderful thing that i have ever experienced and i congratulate you with all my heart on this wonderful discovery these recordings were discovered in the edison library in new jersey in the s the lost chord one of the recordings played at the  august  press conference afterdinner speech at the little menlo sullivans phonographic letter to thomas edison  october  problems listening to the files see media help advertisement for the first recording of the mikado  the first commercial recordings of sullivans music beginning in

by recordings of eight more of the operas electrical recordings of the complete musical scores of most of the operas were then issued by the gramophone company and victor talking machine company beginning in the late s these recordings were supervised by rupert doyly carte the doyly carte opera company continued to produce recordings until  between  and  after the company was revived it recorded seven of the operas other recordings have been made by opera companies such as gilbert and sullivan for all and australian opera among many others ad hoc companies of operatic singers conducted by sir malcolm sargent in the s and s and sir charles mackerras in the s have made audio sets of several savoy operas and in the s alexander faris conducted video recordings of most of the

replacing the strings was put on record in  since  the international gilbert and sullivan festival has released numerous professional and amateur cds and videos of its productions and other sullivan recordings sullivans nonsavoy works were infrequently recorded until the s a few of his songs were put on disc in the early years of the th century including versions of the lost chord by enrico caruso and clara butt the first of many recordings of the overture di ballo was made in the s sullivans irish symphony was first recorded in  under sir charles groves since then much of sullivans

mendelssohn in  waited a year to sing the soprano part in his oratorio elijah which he had written for her she finally did so at a concert in  raising £ to fund a scholarship in his name after sullivan became the first recipient of the scholarship lind encouraged him in his career  a few sources stated that sullivan had some jewish ancestry but jacobs concludes that there is no evidence of any jewish antecedents  between  and  sullivan worked as an organist at two fashionable london churches st michaels chester square pimlico and st peters cranley gardens kensington  grove described the discovery thus i found at the bottom of the cupboard and in its farthest corner a bundle of music books two feet high carefully tied round and black with the undisturbed dust of nearly halfacentury  there were the part books of the whole of the music in rosamunde tied up after the second performance in december  and probably never disturbed since dr schneider curator must have been amused at our excitement  at any rate he kindly overlooked it and gave us permission to  copy what we wanted  the work received an enthusiastic public reception but the musical times printed an early example of critical censure of sullivan for his accessibility the applause which it received was general and spontaneous but it may be a question whether if mr sullivan could not be requested to furnish a higher class of work he should not have been passed over altogether until a more fitting opportunity presented itself  this was for the merchant of venice at the princes theatre manchester sullivans earlier tempest music had been composed for the concert hall rather than theatrical performance although it was later used for at least one stage production  with a classical story and a mixture of political satire and grand opera parody thespis was reminiscent of orpheus in the underworld and la belle hélène by offenbach whose operettas were extremely popular on the english stage in both french and english la belle hélène entered the gaietys repertory eight weeks before the premiere of thespis sullivan may have been encouraged to write the music for thespis by hollingsheads offer of the role of apollo to the composers elder brother the comic actor and singer fred sullivan  the musical score of thespis was never published and is now lost except for one song that was published separately a chorus that was reused in the pirates of penzance and the act ii ballet  sullivan composed  hymns including two settings of nearer my god to thee of which the propior deo is the better known young gives a complete list of sullivans hymns  carte conducted cox and box and some operettas on a tour in  managed by the composers brother fred who played cox cox and box again with fred as cox had been revived in  and arthur sullivan may have been considering a return to comic opera  the title page of the libretto describes trial as a dramatic cantata gilbert and sullivan insisted on calling the rest of their joint works operas often with a descriptive adjective such as a nautical comic opera jacobs p  an aesthetic opera or a japanese opera jacobs preface  in a study of the school and its successor the royal college of music david wright comments on sullivan he lacked any fresh perspective on musical training and any vision of what the ntsm needed to achieve if it was to make a mark  neither did sullivan have real sympathy with the society of arts progressive social ideals of scholarship education regardless of social origin despite having himself gained his education through scholarship support  gilbert sullivan and carte tried for many years to control the american performance copyrights over their operas but they were unable to do so  the viennese music critic eduard hanslick wrote of sullivans conducting of a mozart symphony sullivan presides on the podium from the comfortable recesses of a commodious armchair his left arm lazily extended on the armrest his right giving the beat in a mechanical way his eyes fastened on the score  sullivan never looked up from the notes it was as though he was reading at sight the heavenly piece plodded along for better or for worse listlessly insensibly bernard shaw who praised sullivan as a composer they trained him to make europe yawn and he took advantage of their teaching to make london and new york laugh and whistle commented under his bâton orchestras are never deficient in refinement coarseness exaggeration and carelessness are unacquainted with him so unfortunately are vigor and earnestness  gilbert replied it most certainly never occurred to me to look for any other reward than the honour of being associated however remotely and unworthily in a success which i suppose will endure until music itself shall die pray believe that of the many substantial advantages that have resulted to me from our association this last is and always will be the most highly prized  even after gilbert made changes but retained a magic lozenge that changed people into what they pretended to be sullivan could not accept it  the longestrunning piece of musical theatre was robert planquettes  opéracomique les cloches de corneville which held the record until alfred celliers operetta dorothy ran for  performances beginning in   king olaf caractacus and gerontius owe much to the golden legend – as via them does waltons belshazzars feast  gilbert wrote we have a name jointly for humorous work tempered with occasional glimpses of earnest drama i think we should do unwisely if we left altogether the path which we have trodden together so long and so successfully i can quite understand your desire to write a big work well why not write one but why abandon the savoy business cannot the two things be done concurrently if you can write an oratorio like the martyr of antioch while you are occupied by pieces like patience and iolanthe cant you write a grand opera without giving up pieces like the yeomen of the guard  sullivan continued i have lost the necessary nerve for it and it is not too much to say that it is distasteful to me the types used over and over again unavoidable in such a company as ours the grossmith part the middleaged woman with fading charms cannot again be clothed in music by me nor can i again write to any wildly improbable plot in which there is not some human interest  you say that in serious opera you must more or less sacrifice yourself i say that this is just what i have been doing in all our joint pieces and what is more must continue to do in comic opera to make it successful business and syllabic setting assume an importance which however much they fetter me cannot be overlooked i am bound in the interests of the piece to give way hence the reason of my wishing to do a work where the music is to be the first consideration – where words are to suggest music not govern it and where music will intensify and emphasize the emotional effects of the words  sullivans biographers and scholars of his work have censured tennysons text gervase hughes called it puerile rubbish percy young found it devoid of any kind of merit whatsoever sullivans music was initially wellreceived but sullivans biographers were not impressed one of sullivans lamest  resourceless in magic young not even one memorable number jacobs recent critics however have praised sullivans contribution  caryl brahms speculates that sullivans relationship with his friend the duke of edinburgh who was married included sex but the only evidence cited is unspecified victorian cartoonists  one such flirtation was with anna whom he met in paris in   in  fred appeared as cox in his brothers cox and box at the alhambra theatre and he toured as cox in his own production that summer later that year he played apollo in gilbert and sullivans thespis at the gaiety theatre remaining at the gaiety thereafter he took his own company on tour in the summer of  appearing in his brothers cox and box and the contrabandista and later that year he again played cox this time at the gaiety the next year he created the role of the learned judge in gilbert and sullivans trial by jury a role that he would play in london and on tour for the rest of his career  sullivan could also play the oboe and bassoon but less proficiently  gian andrea mazzucato wrote this glowing summary of sullivans career in the musical standard of  december  the english history of the th century could not record the name of a man whose life work is more worthy of honour study and admiration than the name of sir arthur sullivan  it is a debatable point whether the universal history of music can point to any musical personality since the days of haydn mozart and beethoven whose influence is likely to be more lasting than the influence the great englishman is slowly but surely exerting  i make no doubt that when in proper course of time sir arthur sullivans life and works have become known on the continent he will by unanimous consent be classed among the epochmaking composers the select few whose genius and strength of will empowered them to find and found a national school of music that is to endow their countrymen with the undefinable yet positive means of evoking in a mans soul by the magic of sound those delicate nuances of feeling which are characteristic of the emotional power of each different race  fuller maitland was later discredited when it was shown that he had invented a banal lyric passing it off as genuine and condemning sullivan for supposedly setting such inanity in  fuller maitland admitted that he had been wrong in earlier years to dismiss sullivans comic operas as ephemeral  the first was take a pair of sparkling eyes from the

coghlan – english born of irish and italian descent thomas sullivan was based from  to  at the royal military college sandhurst where he was the bandmaster and taught music privately to supplement his income young sullivan became proficient with many of the instruments in the band and had composed an anthem by the waters of babylon by the age of eight he later recalled i was intensely interested in all that the band did and learned to play every wind instrument with which i formed not merely a passing acquaintance but a real lifelong intimate friendship i gradually learned the peculiarities of each  what it could do and what it was unable to do i learned in the best possible way how to write for an orchestra while recognising the boys obvious musical talent his father knew the insecurity of a musical career and discouraged him from pursuing it while studying at a private school in bayswater sullivan then aged  persuaded his parents and the headmaster to allow him to apply for membership in the choir of the chapel royal despite concerns that sullivan at nearly  years of age was too old to give much service as a treble before his voice broke he was accepted and soon became a soloist and by  was promoted to first boy even at this age sullivans health was delicate and he was easily fatigued sullivan flourished under the training of the reverend thomas helmore master of the choristers and began to compose anthems and songs helmore encouraged the young sullivans composing talent and arranged for one of his pieces o israel to be published in  sullivans first published work helmore also enlisted sullivans assistance in creating harmonisations for a volume of the hymnal noted and arranged for sullivans compositions to be performed one of the boys anthems was given at the chapel royal in st jamess palace under the direction of sir george smart mendelssohn scholaredit sullivan at age  in his academy of music uniform in  the royal academy of music awarded the first mendelssohn scholarship to the yearold sullivan granting him a years training at the academyn  his principal teacher there was john goss whose own teacher thomas attwood had been a pupil of mozart he studied piano with the head of the academy william sterndale bennett and with arthur oleary during this year at the royal academy sullivan continued to sing solos with the chapel royal which provided a small amount of spending money sullivans scholarship was extended to a second year and in  in what the biographer arthur jacobs calls an extraordinary gesture of confidence the scholarship committee extended his grant for a third year so that he could study in germany at the leipzig conservatoire while there sullivan studied composition with julius rietz and carl reinecke counterpoint with moritz hauptmann and ernst richter and the piano with louis plaidy and ignaz moscheles he was trained in mendelssohns ideas and techniques but was also exposed to a variety of musical styles including schubert verdi bach and wagner visiting a synagoguen  he was so struck by some of the cadences and progressions of the music that thirty years later he could recall them for use in his serious opera ivanhoe though the scholarship was extended to permit sullivan to spend one year in leipzig he stayed for three years there he became friendly with the impresario carl rosa and the violinist joseph joachim for his last year at leipzig his father scraped together the money for living expenses and the conservatoire assisted by waiving its fees sullivan credited his leipzig period with tremendous musical growth his graduation piece completed in  was a set of incidental music to shakespeares the tempest revised and expanded it was performed at the crystal palace in  a year after his return to london and was an immediate sensation he began building a reputation as englands most promising young composer rising composeredit colleagues and collaborators clockwise from top left george grove f c burnand richard doyly carte w s gilbert sullivan embarked on his composing career with a series of ambitious works interspersed with hymns parlour songs and other light pieces in a more commercial vein his compositions were not enough to support him financially and from  to  he supplemented his income by working as a church organist which he enjoyed and as a music teacher sometimes at the crystal palace school which he hated and gave up as soon as he couldn  sullivan had an early chance to compose several pieces for royalty in connection with the wedding of the prince of wales in  sullivans association with works for voice and orchestra began with the masque at kenilworth birmingham festival  during a spell as organist at covent garden he composed his first ballet lîle enchantée  in  he premiered his irish symphony and cello concerto his only works in each such genre in the same year his overture in c in memoriam commemorating the recent death of his father was a commission from the norwich festival during his lifetime it achieved considerable popularity in  his overture marmion was premiered by the philharmonic society the times called it another step in advance on the part of the only composer of any remarkable promise that just at present we can boast in the autumn of  sullivan travelled with george grove to vienna in search of neglected manuscript scores by schubert they found and copied several and were particularly excited about their final discovery the score to rosamunden  sullivans first attempt at opera the sapphire necklace – to a libretto by henry f chorley was not produced and is now lost except for the overture and two songs from the work which were separately published his first surviving opera cox and box  was written for a private performance it then received charity performances in london and manchester and was later produced at the gallery of illustration where it ran for an extraordinary  performances w s gilbert writing in fun magazine pronounced the score superior to f c burnands libretto sullivan and burnand were soon commissioned by thomas german reed for a twoact opera the contrabandista  revised and expanded as the chieftain in  but it did not do as well sullivan wrote a group of seven part songs in  the bestknown of which is the long day closes sullivans last major work of the s was a short oratorio the prodigal son premiered in worcester cathedral as part of the  three choirs festival to much praise s first collaborations with gilbertedit early poster showing scenes from the sorcerer hms pinafore and trial by jury sullivans most enduring orchestral work the overture di ballo was composed for the birmingham festival in n  also in  sullivan met gilbert  was a busy year for sullivan he published his only song cycle the window or the songs of the wrens to words by tennyson and he wrote the first of a series of suites of incidental music for west end productions of shakespeare playsn  still in  sullivan composed a dramatic cantata on shore and sea for the opening of the london international exhibition and the hymn onward christian soldiers with words by sabine baringgould the salvation army adopted the latter as its favoured processional and it became sullivans most enduring hymn at the end of  the impresario john hollingshead commissioned sullivan to work with w s gilbert to create the burlesquestyle comic opera thespis for the gaiety theatren  played as a christmas entertainment it ran through to easter  a good run for such a piecen  after thespis gilbert and sullivan went their separate ways until they collaborated on three parlour ballads in late  and early  sullivans largescale works of the early s were the festival te deum crystal palace  and the oratorio the light of the world birmingham festival  he provided suites of incidental music for productions of the merry wives of windsor at the gaiety in  and henry viii at the theatre royal manchester in  he continued to compose hymns throughout the decaden  in  sullivan contributed songs to burnands christmas drawing room extravaganza the miller and his man in  the manager of the royalty theatre richard doyly carte needed a short piece to fill out a bill with offenbachs la périchole carte had conducted sullivans cox and boxn  remembering that gilbert had suggested a libretto to him carte reunited gilbert and sullivan and the result was the oneact comic opera trial by juryn  trial starring sullivans brother fred as the learned judge became a surprise hit earning glowing praise from the critics and playing for  performances over its first few seasons the daily telegraph commented that the piece illustrated the composers great capacity for dramatic writing of the lighter class and other reviews emphasised the felicitous combination of gilberts words and sullivans music one wrote it seems as in the great wagnerian operas as though poem and music had proceeded simultaneously from one and the same brain soon after the opening of trial sullivan wrote the zoo another oneact comic opera with a libretto by b c stephenson but the latter work had only a few short runs and for the next  years sullivans sole operatic collaborator was gilbert the two created an additional  operas together the lost chord  recording of the lost chord  by arthur sullivan and adelaide anne procter sung by reed miller problems playing this file see media help sullivan also turned out more than  popular songs and parlour ballads most of them written before the end of the s his first popular song was orpheus with his lute  and a wellreceived part song was oh hush thee my babie  the best known of his songs is the lost chord  lyrics by adelaide anne procter written in sorrow at the death of his brother frederic the sheet music for his best received songs sold in large numbers and were an important part of his income many of them were adapted as dance pieces in this decade sullivans conducting appointments included the glasgow choral union concerts – and the royal aquarium london  in addition to his appointment as professor of composition at the royal academy of music of which he was a fellow he was appointed as the first principal of the national training school for music in  he accepted the latter post reluctantly fearing that discharging the duties thoroughly would leave too little time for composing in this he was correct as his successor hubert parry also discovered sullivan was not effective in the post and he resigned in n  sullivans next collaboration with gilbert the sorcerer  ran for  performances a success by the standards of the day but hms pinafore  which followed it turned gilbert and sullivan into an international phenomenon the bright and cheerful music of pinafore was composed during a time when sullivan suffered from excruciating pain from a kidney stone pinafore ran for  performances in london the thensecondlongest theatrical run in history and more than  unauthorised productions were quickly mounted in america alonen  among other favourable reviews the times noted that the opera was an early attempt at the establishment of a national musical stage  free from risqué french improprieties and without the aid of italian and german musical models the times and several of the other papers agreed however that while the piece was entertaining sullivan was capable of higher art and frivolous light opera would hold him back this criticism would follow sullivan throughout his career in  sullivan suggested to a reporter from the new york times the secret of his success with gilbert his ideas are as suggestive for music as they are quaint and laughable his numbers  always give me musical ideas pinafore was followed by the pirates of penzance in  another international success which opened in new york and then ran in london for  performances early sedit scenes from the premiere of the golden legend at the leeds music festival  in  sullivan was appointed director of the triennial leeds music festival for his first festival he was commissioned to write a sacred choral work he chose henry hart milmans  dramatic poem based on the life and death of saint margaret the virgin for its basis gilbert adapted the libretto for sullivan the martyr of antioch premiered in october  sullivan was not a showy conductor and some thought him dull and old fashioned on the podiumn  but his composition had an enthusiastic reception and was frequently revived a grateful sullivan presented his collaborator with an engraved silver cup inscribed ws gilbert from his friend arthur sullivann  after the run of the pirates of penzance carte opened the next gilbert and sullivan piece patience in april  at londons opera comique where their past three operas had played in october patience transferred to the new larger stateoftheart savoy theatre built with the profits of the previous gilbert and sullivan works the rest of the partnerships collaborations were produced at the savoy as a result of which they are widely known as the savoy operas iolanthe  gilbert and sullivans fourth hit in a row was the first of the operas to premiere at the new theatre sullivan despite the financial security of writing for the savoy increasingly viewed his work with gilbert as unimportant beneath his skills and also repetitious after iolanthe sullivan had not intended to write a new work with gilbert but he suffered a serious financial loss when his broker went bankrupt in november  therefore he concluded that his financial needs required him to continue writing savoy operas in february  he and gilbert signed a fiveyear agreement with carte requiring them to produce a new comic opera on six months notice on  may  sullivan was knighted by queen victoria for his services  rendered to the promotion of the art of music in britain the musical establishment and many critics believed that this should put an end to his career as a composer of comic opera – that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera having just signed the fiveyear agreement sullivan suddenly felt trapped in middecember he bade farewell to his sisterinlaw charlotte freds widow who emigrated with her young family to america sullivans oldest nephew herbert stayed behind in england as his uncles ward the next opera princess ida  the duos only threeact blank verse work had a noticeably shorter run than its four predecessors although sullivans score was praised with box office receipts lagging in march  carte gave the six months notice under the partnership contract requiring a new opera sullivans close friend the composer frederic clay had suffered a serious stroke in early december  that effectively ended his career at the age of  sullivan reflecting on this on his own longstanding kidney problems and on his desire to devote himself to more serious music replied to carte it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by gilbert and myself programme for the mikado  gilbert had already started work on a new opera involving a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge the composer wrote on  april  that he had come to the end of my tether with the operas i have been continually keeping down the music in order that not one syllable should be lost  i should like to set a story of human interest  probability where the humorous words would come in a humorous not serious situation  where if the situation were a tender or dramatic one the words would be of similar character in a lengthy exchange of correspondence sullivan pronounced gilberts plot sketch particularly the lozenge element unacceptably mechanical and too similar in both its grotesque elements of topsyturveydom and in actual plot to their earlier work especially the sorcerern  and repeatedly requested that gilbert find a new subject the impasse was finally resolved on  may when gilbert proposed a plot that did not depend on any supernatural device the result was gilbert and sullivans most successful work the mikado  the piece ran for  performances which was the secondlongest run for any work of musical theatre and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece up to that timen  later sedit portrait by millais  in the national portrait gallery london it hangs next to frank holls  portrait of gilbert in  sullivan composed his second and last largescale choral work of the decade it was a cantata for the leeds festival the golden legend based on longfellows poem of the same name apart from the comic operas this proved to be sullivans best received fulllength work it was given hundreds of performances during his lifetime and at one point he declared a moratorium on its presentation fearing that it would become overexposed only handels messiah was performed more often in britain in the s and s it remained in the repertory until about the s but since then it has been seldom performed although it received its first professional recording in  the musical scholar and conductor david russell hulme writes that the work influenced elgar and waltonn  ruddigore followed the mikado at the savoy in  it was profitable but its ninemonth run was disappointing compared with most of the earlier savoy operas for their next piece gilbert submitted another version of the magic lozenge plot sullivan immediately rejected it gilbert finally proposed a comparatively serious opera to which sullivan agreed although it was not a grand opera the yeomen of the guard  provided him with the opportunity to compose his most ambitious stage work to date as early as  sullivan had been under pressure from the musical establishment to write a grand opera in  he told an interviewer the opera of the future is a compromise among the french german and italian schools – a sort of eclectic school a selection of the merits of each one i myself will make an attempt to produce a grand opera of this new school  yes it will be an historical work and it is the dream of my life after the yeomen of the guard opened sullivan turned once again to shakespeare composing incidental music for henry irvings production of macbeth  sullivan wished to produce further serious works with gilbert he had collaborated with no other librettist since  but gilbert felt that the reaction to the yeomen of the guard had not been so convincing as to warrant us in assuming that the public want something more earnest still he proposed instead that sullivan should go ahead with his plan to write a grand opera but should continue also to compose comic works for the savoyn  sullivan was not immediately persuaded he replied i have lost the liking for writing comic opera and entertain very grave doubts as to my power of doing itn  nevertheless sullivan soon commissioned a grand opera libretto from julian sturgis who was recommended by gilbert while suggesting to gilbert that he revive an old idea for an opera set in colourful venice the comic opera was completed first the gondoliers  was a piece described by gervase hughes as a pinnacle of sullivans achievement it was the last great gilbert and sullivan success sedit ivanhoe  the relationship between gilbert and sullivan suffered its most serious breach in april  during the run of the gondoliers when gilbert objected to cartes financial accounts for the production including a charge to the partnership for the cost of new carpeting for the savoy theatre lobby gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to carte alone carte was building a new theatre to present sullivans forthcoming grand opera and sullivan sided with carte going so far as to testify erroneously as to certain old debts gilbert took legal action against carte and sullivan and vowed to write no more for the savoy and so the partnership came to an acrimonious end sullivan wrote to gilbert in september  that he was physically and mentally ill over this wretched business i have not yet got over the shock of seeing our names coupled  in hostile antagonism over a few miserable pounds sullivans only grand opera ivanhoe based on walter scotts novel opened at cartes new royal english opera house on  january  sullivan completed the score too late to meet cartes planned production date and costs mounted sullivan was required to pay carte a contractual penalty of £ for his delay the production lasted for  consecutive performances an unprecedented run for a serious opera and earned good notices for its music afterwards carte was unable to fill the new opera house with other opera productions however and ivanhoe was blamed for the failure of the opera house the opera passed into obscurity after a touring revival in – the episode was as the critic herman klein observed the strangest comingling of success and failure ever chronicled in the history of british lyric enterprise sullivan did not seriously consider writing grand opera again later in  sullivan composed music for tennysons the foresters which ran well at dalys theatre in new york in  but failed in london the following yearn  poster for the chieftain  sullivan returned to comic opera but because of the fracture with gilbert he and carte sought other collaborators sullivans next piece was haddon hall  with a libretto by sydney grundy based loosely on the historical elopement of dorothy vernon with john manners although still comic the tone and style of the work was considerably more serious and romantic than most of the operas with gilbert it enjoyed a modest popularity running for  performances and earned critical praise in  sullivan once more provided incidental music for the lyceum this time for j comyns carrs king arthur the partnership with gilbert had been so profitable that carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer eventually succeeding with the help of tom chappell their music publisher their next opera utopia limited  ran for  performances barely covering the expenses of the lavish production although it was the longest run at the savoy in the s sullivan came to disapprove of the leading lady nancy mcintosh and refused to write another piece featuring her while gilbert insisted that she must appear in his next opera instead sullivan teamed up again with his old partner f c burnand the chieftain  a heavily revised version of their earlier twoact opera the contrabandista flopped gilbert and sullivan reunited one more time after mcintosh announced her retirement from the stage for the grand duke  this also failed and sullivan never worked with gilbert again although their operas continued to be revived with success at the savoy in may  sullivans fulllength ballet victoria and merrie england opened at the alhambra theatre to celebrate the queens diamond jubilee the works seven scenes celebrate english history and culture with the victorian period as the grand finale its sixmonth run was considered a great achievement the beauty stone  with a libretto by arthur wing pinero and j comyns carr was based on mediaeval morality plays the collaboration did not go particularly well sullivan wrote that pinero and comyns carr were gifted and brilliant men with no experience in writing for music and when he asked for alterations to improve the structure they refused sullivans score moreover was too serious for the savoy audiences tastes the opera was a critical failure and did not attract a following running for only seven weeks in  to benefit the wives and children of soldiers and sailors on active service in the boer war sullivan composed the music of a jingoistic song the absentminded beggar to a text by rudyard kipling which became an instant sensation and raised an unprecedented £ from performances and the sale of sheet music and related merchandise in the rose of persia  sullivan returned to his comic roots writing to a libretto by basil hood that combined an exotic arabian nights setting with plot elements of the mikado sullivans tuneful score was well received and the opera proved to be his most successful fulllength collaboration apart from those with gilbert another opera with hood the emerald isle quickly went into preparation but sullivan died before it could be completed death honours and legacyedit further information cultural influence of gilbert and sullivan memorial to sullivan victoria embankment gardens london having suffered from

operas are not only frequently performed but also frequently parodied pastiched quoted and imitated in comedy routines advertising law film television and other popular media his legacy apart from writing the savoy operas and his other works is felt perhaps most strongly today through his influence on the american and british musical theatre the innovations in content and form of the works that

daughter of the engineer john scott russell sullivan was a frequent visitor at the scott russell home in the mids and by  the affair was in full bloom rachels parents did not approve of a possible union with a young composer with uncertain financial prospects but the two continued to see each other covertly at some point in  sullivan started a simultaneous and secret affair with rachels sister louise – both relationships had ceased by early  sullivans longest love affair was with the american socialite fanny ronalds a woman three years his senior who had two children he met her in paris around  and the affair began in earnest soon after she moved to london permanently in  a contemporary account described fanny ronalds this way her face was perfectly divine in its loveliness her features small and exquisitely regular her hair was a dark shade of brown – châtain foncé deep chestnut – and very abundant  a lovely woman with the most generous smile one could possibly imagine and the most beautiful teeth sullivan called her the best amateur singer in london she often performed sullivans songs at her famous sunday soirees she became particularly associated with the lost chord singing it both in private and in public often with sullivan accompanying her when sullivan died he left her the autograph manuscript of that song along with other bequests ronalds was separated from her american husband but they never divorced social conventions of the time compelled sullivan and ronalds to keep their relationship private in his diary he would refer to her as mrs ronalds when he saw her in a public setting but l w for little woman or d h possibly dear heart when they were alone together often with a number in parentheses indicating the number of sexual acts completed ronalds was apparently pregnant on at least two occasions and procured abortions in  and  sullivan had a roving eye and his diary records the occasional quarrel when ronalds discovered his other liaisons but he always returned to hern  she was a constant companion up to the time of sullivans death but around  or  the sexual relationship seems to have ended he started to refer to her in the diary as auntie

gambling he enjoyed hosting private dinners and entertainments at his home often featuring famous singers and wellknown actors in  he was initiated into freemasonry and was grand organist of the united grand lodge of england in  during queen victorias golden jubilee sullivans talent and native charm gained him the friendship of many not only in the musical establishment such as grove chorley and herman klein but also in society circles such as alfred duke of edinburgh sullivan enjoyed playing tennis although according to george grossmith i have seen some bad lawntennis players in my time but i never saw anyone so bad as arthur sullivan sullivan was devoted to his parents particularly his mother with whom he corresponded regularly when away from london until her death in  henry lytton wrote i believe there was never a more affectionate tie than that which existed between sullivan and his mother a very witty old lady and one who took an exceptional pride in her sons accomplishments

children under the age of  after freds death arthur visited the family often and became guardian to all of the children in late  charlotte and six of her children emigrated to los angeles california

later in january  charlotte died leaving the six children to be raised mostly by her brother and the older girls from june to august  after the mikado premiered sullivan visited the family in los angeles and took them on a sightseeing trip of the american west throughout the rest of his life and in his will he contributed financially to freds children continuing to correspond with them and to

played with the savoy operas musicedit main article list of musical compositions by arthur sullivan method of composition and text settingedit sullivan by the cartoonist ape sullivan told an interviewer arthur lawrence i dont use the piano in composition – that would limit me terribly sullivan explained that his process was not to wait for inspiration but to dig for it  i decide on the rhythm before i come to the question of melody  i mark out the metre in dots and dashes and not until i have quite settled on the rhythm do i proceed to actual notation sullivans text setting compared with that of his th century english predecessors or his european contemporaries was vastly more sensitive  sullivans operatic style attempts to create for itself a uniquely english textmusic synthesis and in addition by adopting a conservative musical style he was able to achieve the clarity to match gilberts finely honed wit with musical wit of his own in composing the savoy operas sullivan wrote the vocal lines of the musical numbers first and these were given to the actors he or an assistant improvised a piano accompaniment at the early rehearsals he wrote the orchestrations later after he had seen what gilberts stage business would be he left the overtures until last and often delegated their composition based on his outlines to his assistants often adding his suggestions or corrections those sullivan wrote himself include thespis iolanthe princess ida the yeomen of the guard the gondoliers the grand duke and probably utopia limited most of the overtures are structured as a potpourri of tunes from the operas in three sections fast slow and fast those for iolanthe and the yeomen of the guard are written in a modified sonata form the overtures from the gilbert and sullivan operas remain popular and there are many recordings of them sullivan invariably conducted the operas on their opening nights in  a review in the times gave this rationale for the continued vitality of the savoy operas they were never really contemporary in their idiom  gilbert and sullivans world was an artificial world with a neatly controlled and shapely precision  for this each partner has his share of credit the neat articulation of incredibilities in gilberts plots is perfectly matched by his language  of equal importance  gilberts lyrics almost invariably take on extra point and sparkle when set to sullivans music  sullivans tunes in these operas also exist in a makebelieve world of their own  he is a delicate wit whose airs have a precision a neatness a grace and a flowing melody melody and rhythmedit the musical times noted that sullivans tunes at least in the comic operas appeal to the professional as much as to the layman his continental contemporaries such as saintsaëns and the viennese critic eduard hanslick held the savoy operas in high regard hughes writes when sullivan wrote what we call a good tune it was nearly always good music as well outside the ranks of the giants there are few other composers of whom the same could be said although his melodies sprang from rhythm some of his themes may have been prompted by his chosen instrumentation or his harmonic techniques favorite airs from the mikado a  edison records recording of selections from the mikado includes parts of the overture a wandring minstrel three little maids titwillow and the act ii finale problems playing this file see media help in the comic operas where many numbers were in verseplusrefrain form sullivan frequently produced two climaxes in the melodic line hughes instances if you go in iolanthe as a good example in hughess view though most of the tunes in the savoy operas are good ones sullivan rarely reached the same class of excellence elsewhere when he had no librettist to feed his imagination even so on those occasions when gilbert wrote in unvaried metre sullivan often followed suit and produced phrases of simple repetition such as love is a plaintive song patience and a man who would woo a fair maid the yeomen of the guard sullivans deliberate echoes of other composers are covered below under musical quotations but other echoes may not have been conscious hughes cites the concluding bars of tell a tale of cock and bull from the yeomen of the guard as an example of handels influence and another critic edward greenfield found a theme in the slow movement of the irish symphony an outrageous crib from schuberts unfinished symphony harmony and counterpointedit sullivans manuscript for act  finale the yeomen of the guard harmonyedit sullivan was trained in the classical style and contemporary music did not greatly attract him harmonically his early works used the conventional formulae of auber donizetti balfe and schubert later he drew on gounod and bizet mendelssohns influence conspicuous in early works appears intermittently in later ones as a contemporary writer observed sullivan draws on these various influences while remaining recognisably himself yet in the field of harmony hughes writes sullivan remained an eclectic he had easily recognisable habits but his style never achieved individuality in general sullivan preferred to write in major keys in the savoy operas there are only eleven substantial numbers wholly in a minor key less than  of the musical numbers and even in his serious works the major prevails examples of sullivans rare excursions into minor keys include the long e minor melody in the first movement of the irish symphony go away madam in the act i finale of iolanthe echoing verdi and beethoven and the funeral march in the act i finale of the yeomen of the guard sullivan was happy on occasion to use chords traditionally considered technically incorrect when reproached for using consecutive fifths in cox and box he replied if ths turn up it doesnt matter so long as there is no offence to the ear hughes comments that harmonic contrast in the savoy works is enhanced by sullivans characteristic modulation between keys as in expressive glances princess ida where he smoothly negotiates e major c sharp minor and c major or then one of us will be a queen the gondoliers where he writes in f major d flat major and d minor both hughes and jacobs in groves dictionary of music and musicians comment adversely on sullivans overuse of tonic pedals usually in the bass which hughes attributes to lack of enterprise or even downright laziness another sullivan trademark criticised by hughes is the repeated use of the chord of the augmented fourth at moments of pathos in his serious works sullivan attempted to avoid harmonic devices associated with the savoy operas with the result according to hughes that the golden legend is a hotchpotch of harmonic styles counterpointedit sullivan as a conductor c  despite his thorough contrapuntal training in london and leipzig as well as his experience as a church organist sullivan rarely composed fugues hughes cites examples from the epilogue to the golden legend and victoria and merrie england in the savoy operas fugal style is reserved for making fun of legal solemnity in trial by jury and iolanthe eg the lord chancellors leitmotif in the latter less formal counterpoint is employed in numbers such as brightly dawns our wedding day the mikado and when the buds are blossoming ruddigore sullivans best known contrapuntal device was the simultaneous presentation of two or more distinct melodies previously heard independently he was not the first composer to combine themes in this way but it became a characteristic feature of the gilbert and sullivan operas sometimes the melodies were for solo voices as in once more the face i loved so well the zoo and i am so proud the mikado which combines three melodic lines other examples are in choruses where typically a graceful tune for the ladies is combined with a robust one for the men examples include when the foeman bares his steel the pirates of penzance in a doleful train patience and welcome gentry ruddigore at other times notably in how beautifully blue the sky the pirates of penzance one theme is given to the chorus and the other to solo voices orchestrationedit gervase hughes concludes his chapter on sullivans orchestration in this vitally important sector of the composers art he deserves to rank as a master sullivan was a competent player of at least four orchestral instruments flute clarinet trumpet and trombone and a technically highly skilled orchestratorn  though sometimes inclined to indulge in grandiosity when writing for a full symphony orchestra he was adept in using smaller forces to the maximum effect percy young writes that orchestral players generally like playing sullivans music sullivan never asked his players to do what was either uncongenial or impracticable overture di ballo the overture di ballo  is regarded as sullivans most successful orchestral work this military band arrangement is performed by the us

cornets  trombones timpani percussion and strings according to geoffrey toye the number of players in sullivans savoy theatre orchestras was a minimum of  sullivan argued hard for an increase in the pit orchestras size and starting with the yeomen of the guard the orchestra was augmented with a second bassoon and a second tenor trombone sullivan generally orchestrated each score at almost the last moment noting that the accompaniment for an opera had to wait until he saw the staging so that he could judge how heavily or lightly to orchestrate each part of the music for his largescale orchestral pieces sullivan added a second oboe part sometimes double bassoon and bass clarinet more horns trumpets tuba and sometimes an organ andor a harp many of these pieces used very large orchestras one of the most recognisable features in sullivans orchestration is his woodwind scoring hughes especially notes sullivans clarinet writing exploiting all registers and colours of the instrument and his particular fondness for oboe solos for instance the irish symphony contains two long solo oboe passages in succession and in the savoy operas there are many shorter examples in the operas and also in concert works another characteristic sullivan touch is his fondness for pizzicato passages for all the string sections most of the operas have at least one number that hughes calls virtually a pizzicato ostinato he instances kind sir you cannot have the heart the gondoliers free from his fetters grim the yeomen of the guard and in vain to us you plead iolanthe musical quotations

imitated mendelssohn for example in his incidental music for the tempest auber in his henry viii music and gounod in the light of the world in his comic operas sullivan followed offenbachs lead in parodying the idioms of french and italian opera such as those of donizetti bellini and verdi his music also shows the influence of handel schubert and conspicuously in the fairy music in iolanthe mendelssohn the thenpopular composer michael balfe is parodied in the sorcerer and the pirates of penzance and twenty love sick maidens imitates william vincent wallaces alas those chimes from

reputation has undergone extreme changes since he first came to prominence in the s at first critics were struck by his potential and he was hailed as the longawaited great english composer his incidental music to the tempest received an acclaimed premiere at the crystal palace just before sullivans th birthday in april  the athenaeum wrote it  may mark an epoch in english music or we shall be greatly disappointed years on years have elapsed since we have heard a work by so young an artist so full of promise so full of fancy showing so much conscientiousness so much skill and so few references to any model elect his irish symphony of  won similarly enthusiastic praise but as arthur jacobs notes the first rapturous outburst of enthusiasm for sullivan as an orchestral composer did not last a comment typical of those that followed him throughout his career was that sullivans unquestionable talent should make him doubly careful not to mistake popular applause for artistic appreciation when sullivan turned to comic opera with gilbert the serious critics began to express disapproval peter gammond writes of misapprehensions and prejudices delivered to our door by the victorian firm musical snobs ltd  frivolity and high spirits were sincerely seen as elements that could not be exhibited by anyone who was to be admitted to the sanctified society of art as early as  the figaro wrote that sullivan has all the ability to make him a great composer but he wilfully throws his opportunity away  he possesses all the natural ability to have given us an english opera and instead he affords us a little moreorless excellent fooling few critics denied the excellence of sullivans theatre scores the theatre wrote that iolanthe sustains dr sullivans reputation as the most spontaneous fertile and scholarly composer of comic opera this country has ever produced however comic opera no matter how skilfully crafted was viewed as an intrinsically lower form of art than oratorio the athenaeums review of the martyr of antioch declared it is an advantage to have the composer of hms pinafore occupying himself with a worthier form of art knighthood and later yearsedit sullivans knighthood in  gave the serious music critics further ammunition the musical review of that year wrote some things that mr arthur sullivan may do sir arthur ought not to do in other words it will look rather more than odd to see announced in the papers that a new comic opera is in preparation the book by mr w s gilbert and the music by sir arthur sullivan a musical knight can hardly write shop ballads either he must not dare to soil his hands with anything less than an anthem or a madrigal oratorio in which he has so conspicuously shone and symphony must now be his line here is not only an opportunity but a positive obligation for him to return to the sphere from which he has too long descended and do battle for the honour of english art  against all foreign rivals and arouse us thoroughly from our present halftorpid condition even sullivans friend george grove wrote surely the time has come when so able and experienced a master of voice orchestra and stage effect – master too of so much genuine sentiment – may apply his gifts to a serious opera on some subject of abiding human or natural interest sullivan finally redeemed himself in critical eyes with the golden legend in  the observer hailed it as a triumph of english art the world called it one of the greatest creations we have had for many years original bold inspired grand in conception in execution in treatment it is a composition which will make an epoch and which will carry the name of its composer higher on the wings of fame and glory  the effect of the public performance was unprecedented hopes for a new departure were evident in the daily telegraphs review of the yeomen of the guard  sullivans most serious opera to that point the music follows the book to a higher plane and we have a genuine english opera forerunner of many others let us hope and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage sullivans only wholly serious opera ivanhoe  received generally favourable reviews although j a fuller maitland in the times expressed reservations writing that the operas best portions rise so far above anything else that sir arthur sullivan has given to the world and have such force and dignity that it is not difficult to forget the drawbacks which may be found in the want of interest in much of the choral writing and the brevity of the concerted solo parts sullivans  ballet victoria and merrie england was one of several late pieces that won praise from most critics sir arthur sullivans music is music for the people there is no attempt made to force on the public the dullness of academic experience the melodies are all as fresh as last years wine and as exhilarating as sparkling champagne there is not one tune which tires the hearing and in the matter of orchestration our only humorist has let himself run riot not being handicapped with libretto and the gain is enormous  all through we have orchestration of infinite delicacy tunes of alarming simplicity but never a tinge of vulgarity although the more solemn members of the musical establishment could not forgive sullivan for writing music that was both comic and accessible he was nevertheless the nations de facto composer laureaten  posthumous reputationedit in the decade after his death sullivans reputation sank considerably in  fuller maitland took issue with the generally laudatory tone of most of the obituaries is there anywhere a case quite parallel to that of sir arthur sullivan who began his career with a work which at once stamped him as a genius and to the height of which he only rarely attained throughout life  it is because such great natural gifts – gifts greater perhaps than fell to any english musician since  purcell – were so very seldom employed in work worthy of them edward elgar to whom sullivan had been particularly kind rose to sullivans defence branding fuller maitlands obituary the shady side of musical criticism  that foul unforgettable episoden  fuller maitlands followers including ernest walker also dismissed sullivan as merely the idle singer of an empty evening as late as  frank howes music critic of the times condemned sullivan for a lack of sustained effort  a fundamental lack of seriousness towards his art and inability to perceive the smugness the sentimentality and banality of the mendelssohnian detritus  to remain content with the flattest and most obvious rhythms this yielding to a fatal facility that excludes sullivan from the ranks of the good composers th century audiences thomas f dunhill wrote in  that sullivans music has suffered in an extraordinary degree from the vigorous attacks which have been made upon it in professional circles these attacks have succeeded in surrounding the composer with a kind of barricade of prejudice which must be swept away before justice can be done to his genius sir henry wood continued to perform sullivans serious music in  wood presented a sullivan centenary concert at the royal albert hall but it was not until the s that sullivans music other than the savoy operas began to be widely revived and reassessed in  hughes published the first fulllength book about sullivans music which while taking note of his weaknesses which are many and not hesitating to castigate his lapses from good taste which were comparatively rare attempted to view them in perspective against the wider background of his sound musicianship the work of the sir arthur sullivan society founded in  books about sullivan by musicians such as young  and jacobs  and a growing number of recordings have contributed to the reevaluation of sullivans serious music the symphony in e had its first professional recording in  and a considerable number of sullivans nongilbert works have since been recorded scholarly critical editions of a growing number of sullivans works have been published in a  article in the musical times nigel burton wrote sullivan spoke naturally to all people for all time of the passions sorrows and joys which are forever rooted in the human consciousness he believed  that the human beings prime duty in life is to serve humanity it is his artistic consistency in this respect which obliges us to pronounce him our greatest victorian composer time has now sufficiently dispersed the mists of criticism for us to be able to see the truth to enjoy all

neither did sullivan have real sympathy with the society of arts progressive social ideals of scholarship education regardless of social origin despite having himself gained his education through scholarship support  gilbert sullivan and carte tried for many years to control the american performance copyrights over their operas but they were unable to do so  the viennese music critic eduard hanslick wrote of sullivans conducting of a mozart symphony sullivan presides on the podium from the comfortable recesses of a commodious armchair his left arm lazily extended on the armrest his right giving the beat in a mechanical way his eyes fastened on the score  sullivan never looked up from the notes it was as though he was reading at sight the heavenly piece plodded along for better or for worse listlessly insensibly bernard shaw who praised sullivan as a composer they trained him to make europe yawn and he took advantage of their teaching to make london and new york laugh and whistle commented under his bâton orchestras are never deficient in refinement coarseness exaggeration and carelessness are unacquainted with him so unfortunately are vigor and earnestness  gilbert replied it most certainly never occurred to me to look for any other reward than the honour of being associated however remotely and unworthily in a success which i suppose will endure until music itself shall die pray believe that of the many substantial advantages that have resulted to me from our association this last is and always will be the most highly prized  even after gilbert made changes but retained a magic lozenge that changed people into what they pretended to be sullivan could not accept it  the longestrunning piece of musical theatre was robert planquettes  opéracomique les cloches de corneville which held the record until alfred celliers operetta dorothy ran for  performances beginning in   king olaf caractacus and gerontius owe much to the golden legend – as via them does waltons belshazzars feast  gilbert wrote we have a name jointly for humorous work tempered with occasional glimpses of earnest drama i think we should do unwisely if we left altogether the path which we have trodden together so long and so successfully i can quite understand your desire to write a big work well why not write one but why abandon the savoy business cannot the two things be done concurrently if you can write an oratorio like the martyr of antioch while you are occupied by pieces like patience and iolanthe cant you write a grand opera without giving up pieces like the yeomen of the guard  sullivan continued i have lost the necessary nerve for it and it is not too much to say that it is distasteful to me the types used over and over again unavoidable in such a company as ours the grossmith part the middleaged woman with fading charms cannot again be clothed in music by me nor can i again write to any wildly improbable plot in which there is not some human interest  you say that in serious opera you must more or less sacrifice yourself i say that this is just what i have been doing in all our joint pieces and what is more must continue to do in comic opera to make it successful business and syllabic setting assume an importance which however much they fetter me cannot be overlooked i am bound in the interests of the piece to give way hence the reason of my wishing to do a work where the music is to be the first consideration – where words are to suggest music not govern it and where music will intensify and emphasize the emotional effects of the words  sullivans biographers and scholars of his work have censured tennysons text gervase hughes called it puerile rubbish percy young found it devoid of any kind of merit whatsoever sullivans music was initially wellreceived but sullivans biographers were not impressed one of sullivans lamest  resourceless in magic young not even one memorable number jacobs recent critics however have praised sullivans contribution  caryl brahms speculates that sullivans relationship with his friend the duke of edinburgh who was married included sex but the only evidence cited is unspecified victorian cartoonists  one such flirtation was with anna whom he met in paris in   in  fred appeared as cox in his brothers cox and box at the alhambra theatre and he toured as cox in his own production that summer later that year he played apollo in gilbert and sullivans thespis at the gaiety theatre remaining at the gaiety thereafter he took his own company on tour in the summer of  appearing in his brothers cox and box and the contrabandista and later that year he again played cox this time at the gaiety the next year he created the role of the learned judge in gilbert and sullivans trial by jury a role that he would play in london and on tour for the rest of his career  sullivan could also play the oboe and bassoon but less proficiently  gian andrea mazzucato wrote this glowing summary of sullivans career in the musical standard of  december  the english history of the th century could not record the name of a man whose life work is more worthy of honour study and admiration than the name of sir arthur sullivan  it is a debatable point whether the universal history of music can point to any musical personality since the days of haydn mozart and beethoven whose influence is likely to be more lasting than the influence the great englishman is slowly but surely exerting  i make no doubt that when in proper course of time sir arthur sullivans life and works have become known on the continent he will by unanimous consent be classed among the epochmaking composers the select few whose genius and strength of will empowered them to find and found a national school of music that is to endow their countrymen with the undefinable yet positive means of evoking in a mans soul by the magic of sound those delicate nuances of feeling which are characteristic of the emotional power of each different race  fuller maitland was later discredited when it was shown that he had invented a banal lyric passing it off as genuine and condemning sullivan for supposedly setting such inanity in  fuller maitland admitted that he had been wrong in earlier years to dismiss sullivans comic operas as ephemeral  the first was take a pair of sparkling eyes from the

all that the band did and learned to play every wind instrument with which i formed not merely a passing acquaintance but a real lifelong intimate friendship i gradually learned the peculiarities of each  what it could do and what it was unable to do i learned in the best possible way how to write for an orchestra while recognising the boys obvious musical talent his father knew the insecurity of a musical career and discouraged him from pursuing it while studying at a private school in bayswater sullivan then aged  persuaded his parents and the headmaster to allow him to apply for membership

a small amount of spending money sullivans scholarship was extended to a second year and in  in what the biographer arthur jacobs calls an extraordinary gesture of confidence the scholarship committee extended his grant for a third year so that he could study in germany at the leipzig conservatoire while there sullivan studied composition with julius rietz and carl reinecke counterpoint with moritz hauptmann and ernst richter and the piano with louis plaidy and ignaz moscheles he was trained in mendelssohns ideas and techniques but was also exposed to a variety of musical styles including schubert verdi bach and wagner visiting a synagoguen  he was so struck by some of the cadences and progressions of the music that thirty years later he could recall them for use in his serious opera

praise from the critics and playing for  performances over its first few seasons the daily telegraph commented that the piece illustrated the composers great capacity for dramatic writing of the lighter class and other reviews emphasised the felicitous combination of gilberts words and sullivans music one wrote it seems as in the great wagnerian operas as though poem and music had proceeded simultaneously from one and the same brain soon after the opening of trial sullivan wrote the zoo another oneact comic opera with a libretto by b c stephenson but the latter work had only a few short

sorrow at the death of his brother frederic the sheet music for his best received songs sold in large numbers and were an important part of his income many of them were adapted as dance pieces in this decade sullivans conducting appointments included the glasgow choral union concerts – and the royal aquarium london  in addition to his appointment as professor of composition at the royal academy of music of which he was a fellow he was appointed as the first principal of the national training school for music in  he accepted the latter post reluctantly fearing that discharging the duties thoroughly would leave too little time for composing in this he was correct as his successor hubert parry also discovered sullivan was not effective in the post and he resigned in n  sullivans next collaboration with gilbert the sorcerer  ran for  performances a success by the standards of the day but hms pinafore  which followed it turned gilbert and sullivan into an international phenomenon the bright and cheerful music of pinafore was composed during a time when sullivan suffered from excruciating pain from a kidney stone pinafore ran for  performances in london the thensecondlongest theatrical run in history and more than  unauthorised productions were quickly mounted in america alonen  among other favourable reviews the times noted that the opera was an early attempt at the establishment of a national musical stage  free from risqué french improprieties and without the aid of italian and german musical models the times and several of the other papers agreed however that while the piece was entertaining sullivan was capable of higher art and frivolous light opera would hold him back this criticism would follow sullivan throughout his career in  sullivan suggested to a reporter from the new york times the secret of his success with gilbert his ideas are as suggestive for music as they are quaint and laughable his numbers  always give me musical ideas pinafore was

dramatic poem based on the life and death of saint margaret the virgin for its basis gilbert adapted the libretto for sullivan the martyr of antioch premiered in october  sullivan was not a showy conductor and some thought him dull and old fashioned on the podiumn  but his composition had an enthusiastic reception and was frequently revived a grateful sullivan presented his collaborator with

the rest of the partnerships collaborations were produced at the savoy as a result of which they are widely known as the savoy operas iolanthe  gilbert and sullivans fourth hit in a row was the first of the operas to premiere at the new theatre sullivan despite the financial security of writing for the savoy increasingly viewed his work with gilbert as unimportant beneath his skills and also repetitious after iolanthe sullivan had not intended to write a new work with gilbert but he suffered a serious financial loss when his broker went bankrupt in november  therefore he concluded that his financial needs required him to continue writing savoy operas in february  he and gilbert signed a fiveyear agreement with carte requiring them to produce a new comic opera on six months notice on  may  sullivan was knighted by queen victoria for his services  rendered to the promotion of the art of music in britain the musical establishment and many critics believed that this should put an end to his career as a composer of comic opera – that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera having just signed the fiveyear agreement sullivan suddenly felt trapped in middecember he bade farewell to his sisterinlaw charlotte freds widow who emigrated with her young family to america sullivans oldest nephew herbert stayed behind in england as his uncles ward the next opera princess ida  the duos only threeact blank verse work had a noticeably shorter run than its four predecessors although sullivans score was praised with box office receipts lagging in march  carte gave the six months notice under the partnership contract requiring a new opera sullivans close friend the composer frederic clay had suffered a serious stroke in early december  that effectively ended his career at the age of  sullivan reflecting on this on his own longstanding kidney problems and on his desire to devote himself to more serious music replied to carte it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by gilbert and myself programme for the mikado  gilbert had already started work on a new opera involving a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge the composer wrote on  april  that he had come to the end of my tether with the operas i have been continually keeping down the music in order that not one syllable should be lost  i should like to set a story of human interest  probability where the humorous words would come in a humorous not serious situation  where if the situation were a tender or dramatic one the words would be of similar character in a lengthy exchange of correspondence sullivan pronounced gilberts plot sketch particularly the lozenge element unacceptably mechanical and too similar in both its grotesque elements of topsyturveydom and in actual plot to their earlier work especially the sorcerern  and repeatedly requested that gilbert find a new subject the impasse was finally resolved on  may when gilbert proposed a plot that did not depend on any supernatural device the result was gilbert and sullivans most successful work the mikado  the piece ran for  performances which was the secondlongest run for any work of musical theatre and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece up to that timen  later sedit portrait by millais  in the national portrait gallery london it hangs next to frank holls  portrait of gilbert in  sullivan composed his second and last largescale choral work of the decade it was a cantata for the leeds festival the golden legend based on longfellows poem of the same name apart from the comic operas this proved to be sullivans best received fulllength work it was given hundreds of performances during his lifetime and at one point he declared a moratorium on its presentation fearing that it would become overexposed only handels messiah was performed more often in britain in the s and s it remained in the repertory until about the s but since then it has been seldom performed although it received its first professional recording in  the musical scholar and conductor david russell hulme writes that the work influenced elgar and waltonn  ruddigore followed the mikado at the savoy in  it was profitable but its ninemonth run was disappointing compared with most of the earlier savoy operas for their next piece gilbert submitted another version of the magic lozenge plot sullivan immediately rejected it gilbert finally proposed a comparatively serious opera to which sullivan agreed although it was not a grand opera the yeomen of the guard  provided him with the opportunity to compose his most ambitious stage work to date as early as  sullivan had been under pressure from the musical establishment to write a grand opera in  he told an interviewer the opera of the future is a compromise among the french german and italian schools – a sort of eclectic school a selection of the merits of each one i myself will make an attempt to produce a grand opera of this new school  yes it will be an historical work and it is the dream of my life after the yeomen of the guard opened sullivan turned once again to shakespeare composing incidental music for henry irvings production of macbeth  sullivan wished to produce further serious works with gilbert he had collaborated with no other librettist since  but gilbert felt that the reaction to the yeomen of the guard had not been so convincing as to warrant us in assuming that the public want something more earnest still he proposed instead that sullivan should go ahead with his plan to write a grand opera but should continue also to compose comic works for the savoyn  sullivan was not immediately persuaded he replied i have lost the liking for writing comic opera and entertain very grave doubts as to my power of doing itn  nevertheless sullivan soon commissioned a grand opera libretto from julian sturgis who was recommended by gilbert while suggesting to gilbert that he revive an old idea for an opera set in colourful venice the comic opera was completed first the gondoliers  was a piece described by gervase hughes as a pinnacle of sullivans achievement it was the last great gilbert and sullivan success sedit ivanhoe  the relationship between gilbert and sullivan suffered its most serious breach in april  during the run of the gondoliers when gilbert objected to cartes financial accounts for the production including a charge to the partnership for the cost of new carpeting for the savoy theatre lobby gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to carte alone carte was building a new theatre to present sullivans forthcoming grand opera and sullivan sided with carte going so far as to testify erroneously as to certain old debts gilbert took legal action against carte and sullivan and vowed to write no more for the savoy and so the partnership came to an acrimonious end sullivan wrote to gilbert in september  that he was physically and mentally ill over this wretched business i have not yet got over the shock of seeing our names coupled  in hostile antagonism over a few miserable pounds sullivans only grand opera ivanhoe based on walter scotts novel opened at cartes new royal english opera house on  january  sullivan completed the score too late to meet cartes planned production date and costs mounted sullivan was required to pay carte a contractual penalty of £ for his delay the production lasted for  consecutive performances an unprecedented run for a serious opera and earned good notices for its music afterwards carte was unable to fill the new opera house with other opera productions however and ivanhoe was blamed for the failure of the opera house the opera passed into obscurity after a touring revival in – the episode was as the critic herman klein observed the strangest comingling of success and failure ever chronicled in the history of british lyric enterprise sullivan did not seriously consider writing grand opera again later in  sullivan composed music for tennysons the foresters which ran well at dalys theatre in new york in  but failed in london the following yearn  poster for the chieftain  sullivan returned to comic opera but because of the fracture with gilbert he and carte sought other collaborators sullivans next piece was haddon hall  with a libretto by sydney grundy based loosely on the historical elopement of dorothy vernon with john manners although still comic the tone and style of the work was considerably more serious and romantic than most of the operas with gilbert it enjoyed a modest popularity running for  performances and earned critical praise in  sullivan once more provided incidental music for the lyceum this time for j comyns carrs king arthur the partnership with gilbert had been so profitable that carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer eventually succeeding with the help of tom chappell their music publisher their next opera utopia limited  ran for  performances barely covering the expenses of the lavish production although it was the longest run at the savoy in the s sullivan came to disapprove of the leading lady nancy mcintosh and refused to write another piece featuring her while gilbert insisted that she must appear in his next opera instead sullivan teamed up again with his old partner f c burnand the chieftain  a heavily revised version of their earlier twoact opera the contrabandista flopped gilbert and sullivan reunited one more time after mcintosh announced her retirement from the stage for the grand duke  this also failed and sullivan never worked with gilbert again although their operas continued to be revived with success at the savoy in may  sullivans fulllength ballet victoria and merrie england opened at the alhambra theatre to celebrate the queens diamond jubilee the works seven scenes celebrate english history and culture with the victorian period as the grand finale its sixmonth run was considered a great achievement the beauty stone  with a libretto by arthur wing pinero and j comyns carr was based on mediaeval morality plays the collaboration did not go particularly well sullivan wrote that pinero and comyns carr were gifted and brilliant men with no experience in writing for music and when he asked for alterations to improve the structure they refused sullivans score moreover was too serious for the savoy audiences tastes the opera was a critical failure and did not attract a following running for only seven weeks in  to benefit the wives and children of soldiers and sailors on active service in the boer war sullivan composed the music of a jingoistic song the absentminded beggar to a text by rudyard kipling which became an instant sensation and raised an unprecedented £ from performances and the sale of sheet music and related merchandise in the rose of persia  sullivan returned to his comic roots writing to a libretto by basil hood that combined an exotic arabian nights setting with plot elements of the mikado sullivans tuneful score was well received and the opera proved to be his most successful fulllength collaboration apart from those with gilbert another opera with hood the emerald isle quickly went into preparation but sullivan died

operas are not only frequently performed but also frequently parodied pastiched quoted and imitated in comedy routines advertising law film television and other popular media his legacy apart from writing the savoy operas and his other works is felt perhaps most strongly today through his influence on the american and british musical theatre the innovations in content and form of the works that he and gilbert developed directly influenced the development of the modern musical throughout the th century in addition biographies and scholarly articles and analyses continue to be written about

daughter of the engineer john scott russell sullivan was a frequent visitor at the scott russell home in the mids and by  the affair was in full bloom rachels parents did not approve of a possible union with a young composer with uncertain financial prospects but the two continued to see each other covertly at some point in  sullivan started a simultaneous and secret affair with rachels sister louise – both relationships had ceased by early  sullivans longest love affair was with the american socialite fanny ronalds a woman three years his senior who had two children he met her in paris around  and the affair began in earnest soon after she moved to london permanently in  a contemporary account described fanny ronalds this way her face was perfectly divine in its loveliness her features small and exquisitely regular her hair was a dark shade of brown – châtain foncé deep chestnut – and very abundant  a lovely woman with the most generous smile one could possibly imagine and the most beautiful teeth sullivan called her the best amateur singer in london she often performed sullivans songs at her famous sunday soirees she became particularly associated with the lost chord singing it both in private and in public often with sullivan accompanying her when sullivan died he left her the autograph manuscript of that song along with other bequests ronalds was separated from her american husband but they never divorced social conventions of the time compelled sullivan and ronalds to keep their relationship private in his diary he would refer to her as mrs ronalds when he saw her in a public setting but l w for little woman or d h possibly dear heart when they were alone together often with a number in parentheses indicating the number of sexual acts completed ronalds was apparently pregnant on at least two occasions and procured abortions in  and  sullivan had a roving eye and his diary records the occasional quarrel when ronalds discovered his other liaisons but he always returned to hern  she was a constant companion up to the time of sullivans death but around  or  the sexual relationship seems to have ended he started to refer to her in the diary as auntie

but i never saw anyone so bad as arthur sullivan sullivan was devoted to his parents particularly his mother with whom he corresponded regularly when away from london until her death in  henry lytton wrote i believe there was never a more affectionate tie than that which existed between sullivan and his mother a very witty old lady and one who took an exceptional pride in her sons accomplishments

interviewer arthur lawrence i dont use the piano in composition – that would limit me terribly sullivan explained that his process was not to wait for inspiration but to dig for it  i decide on the rhythm before i come to the question of melody  i mark out the metre in dots and dashes and not until i have quite settled on the rhythm do i proceed to actual notation sullivans text setting compared with that of his th century english predecessors or his european contemporaries was vastly more sensitive  sullivans operatic style attempts to create for itself a uniquely english textmusic synthesis and in addition by adopting a conservative musical style he was able to achieve the clarity to match gilberts finely honed wit with musical wit of his own in composing the savoy operas sullivan wrote the vocal lines of the musical numbers first and these were given to the actors he or an assistant improvised a piano accompaniment at the early rehearsals he wrote the orchestrations later after he had seen what gilberts stage business would be he left the overtures until last and often delegated their composition based on his outlines to his assistants often adding his suggestions or corrections those sullivan wrote himself include thespis iolanthe princess ida the yeomen of the guard the gondoliers the grand duke and probably utopia limited most of the overtures are structured as a potpourri of tunes from the operas in three sections fast slow and fast those for iolanthe and the yeomen of the guard are written in a modified sonata form the overtures from the gilbert and sullivan operas remain popular and there are many recordings of them sullivan invariably conducted the operas on their opening nights in  a review in the times gave this rationale for the continued vitality of the savoy operas they were never really contemporary in their idiom  gilbert and sullivans world was an artificial world with a neatly controlled and shapely precision  for this each partner has his share of credit the neat articulation of incredibilities in gilberts plots is perfectly matched by his language  of equal importance  gilberts lyrics almost invariably take on extra point and sparkle when set to sullivans music  sullivans tunes in these operas also exist in a makebelieve world of their own  he is a delicate wit whose airs have a precision a neatness a grace and a flowing melody melody and rhythmedit the musical times noted that sullivans tunes at least in the comic operas appeal to the professional as much as to the layman his continental contemporaries such as saintsaëns and the viennese critic eduard hanslick held the savoy operas in high regard hughes writes when sullivan wrote what we call a good tune it was nearly always good music as well outside the ranks of the giants there are few other composers of whom the same could be said although his melodies sprang from rhythm some of his themes may have been prompted by his chosen instrumentation or his harmonic techniques favorite airs from the mikado a  edison records recording of selections from the mikado includes parts of the overture a wandring minstrel three little maids titwillow and the act ii finale problems playing this file see media help in the comic operas where many numbers were in verseplusrefrain form sullivan frequently produced two climaxes in the melodic line hughes instances if you go in iolanthe as a good example in hughess view though most of the tunes in the savoy operas are good ones sullivan rarely reached the same class of excellence elsewhere when he had no librettist to feed his imagination even so on those occasions when gilbert wrote in unvaried metre sullivan often followed suit and produced phrases of simple repetition such as love is a plaintive song patience and a man who would woo a fair maid the yeomen of the guard sullivans deliberate echoes of other composers are covered below under musical quotations but other echoes may not have been conscious hughes cites the concluding bars of tell a tale of cock and bull from the yeomen of the guard as an example of handels influence and another critic edward greenfield found a theme in the slow movement of the irish symphony an outrageous crib from schuberts unfinished symphony harmony and counterpointedit sullivans manuscript for act  finale the yeomen of the guard harmonyedit sullivan was trained in the classical style and contemporary music did not greatly attract him harmonically his early works used the conventional formulae of auber donizetti balfe and schubert later he drew on gounod and bizet mendelssohns influence conspicuous in early works appears intermittently in later ones as a contemporary writer observed sullivan draws on these various influences while remaining recognisably himself yet in the field of harmony hughes writes sullivan remained an eclectic he had easily recognisable habits but his style never achieved individuality in general sullivan preferred to write in major keys in the savoy operas there are only eleven substantial numbers wholly in a minor key less than  of the musical numbers and even in his serious works the major prevails examples of sullivans rare excursions into minor keys include the long e minor melody in the first movement of the irish symphony go away madam in the act i finale of iolanthe echoing verdi and beethoven and the funeral march in the act i finale of the yeomen of the guard sullivan was happy on occasion to use chords traditionally considered technically incorrect when reproached for using consecutive fifths in cox and box he replied if ths turn up it doesnt matter so long as there is no offence to the ear hughes comments that harmonic contrast in the savoy works is enhanced by sullivans characteristic modulation between keys as in expressive glances princess ida where he smoothly negotiates e major c sharp minor and c major or then one of us will be a queen the gondoliers where he writes in f major d flat major and d minor both hughes and jacobs in groves dictionary of music and musicians comment adversely on sullivans overuse of tonic pedals usually in the bass which hughes attributes to lack of enterprise or even downright laziness another sullivan trademark criticised by hughes is the repeated use of the chord of the augmented fourth at moments of pathos in his serious works sullivan attempted to avoid harmonic devices associated with the savoy operas with the result according to hughes that the golden legend is a hotchpotch of harmonic styles counterpointedit sullivan as a conductor c  despite his thorough contrapuntal training in london and leipzig as well as his experience as a church organist sullivan rarely composed fugues hughes cites examples from the epilogue to the golden legend and victoria and merrie england in the savoy operas fugal style is reserved for making fun of legal solemnity in trial by jury and iolanthe eg the lord chancellors leitmotif in the latter less formal counterpoint is employed in numbers such as brightly dawns our wedding day the mikado and when the buds are blossoming ruddigore sullivans best known contrapuntal device was the simultaneous presentation of two or more distinct melodies previously heard independently he was not the first composer to combine themes in this way but it became a characteristic feature of the gilbert and sullivan operas sometimes the melodies were for solo voices as in once more the face i loved so well the zoo and i am so proud the mikado which combines three melodic lines other examples are in choruses where typically a graceful tune for the ladies is combined with a robust one for the men examples include when the foeman bares his steel the pirates of penzance in a doleful train patience and welcome gentry ruddigore at other times notably in how beautifully blue the sky the pirates of penzance one theme is given to the chorus and the other to solo voices orchestrationedit gervase hughes concludes his chapter on sullivans orchestration in this vitally important sector of the composers art he deserves to rank as a master sullivan was a competent player of at least four orchestral instruments flute clarinet trumpet and trombone and a technically highly skilled orchestratorn  though sometimes inclined to indulge in grandiosity when writing for a full symphony orchestra he was adept in using smaller forces to the maximum effect percy young writes that orchestral players generally like playing sullivans music sullivan never asked his players to do what was either uncongenial or impracticable overture di ballo the overture di ballo  is regarded as sullivans most successful orchestral work this military band arrangement is performed by the us

cornets  trombones timpani percussion and strings according to geoffrey toye the number of players in sullivans savoy theatre orchestras was a minimum of  sullivan argued hard for an increase in the pit orchestras size and starting with the yeomen of the guard the orchestra was augmented with a second bassoon and a second tenor trombone sullivan generally orchestrated each score at almost the last moment noting that the accompaniment for an opera had to wait until he saw the staging so that he could judge how heavily or lightly to orchestrate each part of the music for his largescale orchestral pieces sullivan added a second oboe part sometimes double bassoon and bass clarinet more horns trumpets tuba and sometimes an organ andor a harp many of these pieces used very large orchestras one of the most recognisable features in sullivans orchestration is his woodwind scoring hughes especially notes sullivans clarinet writing exploiting all registers and colours of the instrument and his particular fondness for oboe solos for instance the irish symphony contains two long solo oboe passages in succession and in the savoy operas there are many shorter examples in the operas and also in concert works another characteristic sullivan touch is his fondness for pizzicato passages for all the string sections most of the operas have at least one number that hughes calls virtually a pizzicato ostinato he instances kind sir you cannot have the heart the gondoliers free from his fetters grim the yeomen of the guard and in vain to us you plead iolanthe musical quotations and parodiesedit sullivan in about  sullivan often quoted or imitated famous themes and passages from wellknown tunes or parodied the styles of famous composers he also liked to evoke familiar musical styles such as his madrigals in the mikado ruddigore and the yeomen of the guard glees in hms pinafore and the mikado and gavottes in ruddigore and the gondoliers in the sorcerer there is a country dance in if youll marry me in ruddigore the sailor character dances a hornpipe while in the mikado sullivan quotes a japanese war song in miya sama sullivans  trip to egypt inspired musical styles in his later opera the rose of persia of the sextette i hear the soft note in patience sullivan said to the singers i think you will like this it is dr arne and purcell at their best in early pieces he imitated mendelssohn for example in his incidental music for the tempest auber in his henry viii music and gounod in the light of the world in his comic operas sullivan followed offenbachs lead in parodying the idioms of french and italian opera such as those of donizetti bellini and verdi his music also shows the influence of handel schubert and conspicuously in the fairy music in iolanthe mendelssohn the thenpopular composer michael balfe is parodied in the sorcerer and the pirates of penzance and twenty love sick maidens imitates william vincent wallaces alas those chimes from maritana the sextet a nice dilemma in trial by jury parodies dun pensiero in bellinis la sonnambula sullivan depicted in  teasing the leading academic alexander mackenzie whose operetta his majesty failed at the savoy other examples of opera parody include mabels aria poor wandring one in the pirates of penzance and the duet who are you sir from cox and box in hms pinafore the whispered plans for elopement in this very night parody the conspirators choruses in verdis il trovatore and rigoletto and the octet farewell my own evokes the ensemble mag der himmel euch vergeben in flotows martha and such concerted numbers as the sextet in donizettis lucia di lammermoor the mockjingoistic he is an englishman in hms pinafore and choral passages in the zoo satirise patriotic british tunes such as arnes rule britannia the chorus with catlike tread from pirates is an imitation of verdis anvil chorus from il trovatore in princess ida there is a strong handelian flavour to aracs song in act iii

quotation from chopins waltz no  in aflat major op  in the gondoliers there are the spanish cachucha the italian saltarello and tarantella and the venetian barcarolle hughes compares here is a case unprecedented from the gondoliers to the act ii quintet from bizets carmen in a more humane mikado when the mikado mentions bach interwoven with spohr and beethoven the clarinet and bassoon quote the fugue subject of bachs fantasia and fugue in g minor the golden legend shows the influence of liszt and wagner sullivan frequently gives groups or locations their own characters and motifs hughes points to the striking difference between the male chorus of rustics in the sorcerer and the eponymous gondoliers and between the fairies in iolanthe and the undergraduates in princess ida hms pinafore retains a nautical tang throughout and in the yeomen of the guard the tower of london is evoked continually by its own motif a distinctive fournote theme is associated with the character

reputation has undergone extreme changes since he first came to prominence in the s at first critics were struck by his potential and he was hailed as the longawaited great english composer his incidental music to the tempest received an acclaimed premiere at the crystal palace just before sullivans th birthday in april  the athenaeum wrote it  may mark an epoch in english music or we shall be greatly disappointed years on years have elapsed since we have heard a work by so young an artist so full of promise so full of fancy showing so much conscientiousness so much skill and so few references to any model elect his irish symphony of  won similarly enthusiastic praise but as arthur jacobs notes the first rapturous outburst of enthusiasm for sullivan as an orchestral composer did not last a comment typical of those that followed him throughout his career was that sullivans unquestionable talent should make him doubly careful not to mistake popular applause for artistic appreciation when sullivan turned to comic opera with gilbert the serious critics began to express disapproval peter gammond writes of misapprehensions and prejudices delivered to our door by the victorian firm musical snobs ltd  frivolity and high spirits were sincerely seen as elements that could not be exhibited by anyone who was to be admitted to the sanctified society of art as early as  the figaro wrote that sullivan has all the ability to make him a great composer but he wilfully throws his opportunity away  he possesses all the natural ability to have given us an english opera and instead he affords us a little moreorless excellent fooling few critics denied the excellence of sullivans theatre scores the theatre wrote that iolanthe sustains dr sullivans reputation as the most spontaneous fertile and scholarly composer of comic opera this country has ever produced however comic opera no matter how skilfully crafted was viewed as an intrinsically lower form of art than oratorio the athenaeums review of the martyr of antioch declared it is an advantage to have the composer of hms pinafore occupying himself with a worthier form of art knighthood and later yearsedit sullivans knighthood in  gave the serious music critics further ammunition the musical review of that year wrote some things that mr arthur sullivan may do sir arthur ought not to do in other words it will look rather more than odd to see announced in the papers that a new comic opera is in preparation the book by mr w s gilbert and the music by sir arthur sullivan a musical knight can hardly write shop ballads either he must not dare to soil his hands with anything less than an anthem or a madrigal oratorio in which he has so conspicuously shone and symphony must now be his line here is not only an opportunity but a positive obligation for him to return to the sphere from which he has too long descended and do battle for the honour of english art  against all foreign rivals and arouse us thoroughly from our present halftorpid condition even sullivans friend george grove wrote surely the time has come when so able and experienced a master of voice orchestra and stage effect – master too of so much genuine sentiment – may apply his gifts to a serious opera on some subject of abiding human or natural interest sullivan finally redeemed himself in critical eyes with the golden legend in  the observer hailed it as a triumph of english art the world called it one of the greatest creations we have had for many years original bold inspired grand in conception in execution in treatment it is a composition which will make an epoch and which will carry the name of its composer higher on the wings of fame and glory  the effect of the public performance was unprecedented hopes for a new departure were evident in the daily telegraphs review of the yeomen of the guard  sullivans most serious opera to that point the music follows the book to a higher plane and we have a genuine english opera forerunner of many others let us hope and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage sullivans only wholly serious opera ivanhoe  received generally favourable reviews although j a fuller maitland in the times expressed reservations writing that the operas best portions rise so far above anything else that sir arthur sullivan has given to the world and have such force and dignity that it is not difficult to forget the drawbacks which may be found in the want of interest in much of the choral writing and the brevity of the concerted solo parts sullivans  ballet victoria and merrie england was one of several late pieces that won praise from most critics sir arthur sullivans music is music for the people there is no attempt made to force on the public the dullness of academic experience the melodies are all as fresh as last years wine and as exhilarating as sparkling champagne there is not one tune which tires the hearing and in the matter of orchestration our only humorist has let himself run riot not being handicapped with libretto and the gain is enormous  all through we have orchestration of infinite delicacy tunes of alarming simplicity but never a tinge of vulgarity although the more solemn members of the musical establishment could not forgive sullivan for writing music that was both comic and accessible he was nevertheless the nations de facto composer laureaten  posthumous reputationedit in the decade after his death sullivans reputation sank considerably in  fuller maitland took issue with the generally laudatory tone of most of the obituaries is there anywhere a case quite parallel to that of sir arthur sullivan who began his career with a work which at once stamped him as a genius and to the height of which he only rarely attained throughout life  it is because such great natural gifts – gifts greater perhaps than fell to any english musician since  purcell – were so very seldom employed in work worthy of them edward elgar to whom sullivan had been particularly kind rose to sullivans defence branding fuller maitlands obituary the shady side of musical criticism  that foul unforgettable episoden  fuller maitlands followers including ernest walker also dismissed sullivan as merely the idle singer of an empty evening as late as  frank howes music critic of the times condemned sullivan for a lack of sustained effort  a fundamental lack of seriousness towards his art and inability to perceive the smugness the sentimentality and banality of the mendelssohnian detritus  to remain content with the flattest and most obvious rhythms this yielding to a fatal facility that excludes sullivan from the ranks of the good composers th century audiences thomas f dunhill wrote in  that sullivans music has suffered in an extraordinary degree from the vigorous attacks which have been made upon it in professional circles these attacks have succeeded in surrounding the composer with a kind of barricade of prejudice which must be swept away before justice can be done to his genius sir henry wood continued to perform sullivans serious music in  wood presented a sullivan centenary concert at the royal albert hall but it was not until the s that sullivans music other than the savoy operas began to be widely revived and reassessed in  hughes published the first fulllength book about sullivans music which while taking note of his weaknesses which are many and not hesitating to castigate his lapses from good taste which were comparatively rare attempted to view them in perspective against the wider background of his sound musicianship the work of the sir arthur sullivan society founded in  books about sullivan by musicians such as young  and jacobs  and a growing number of recordings have contributed to the reevaluation of sullivans serious music the symphony in e had its first professional recording in  and a considerable number of sullivans nongilbert works have since been recorded scholarly critical editions of a growing number of sullivans works have been published in a  article in the musical times nigel burton wrote sullivan spoke naturally to all people for all time of the passions sorrows and joys which are forever rooted in the human consciousness he believed  that the human beings prime duty in life is to serve humanity it is his artistic consistency in this respect which obliges us to pronounce him our greatest victorian composer time has now sufficiently dispersed the mists of criticism for us to be able to see the truth to enjoy all his music and to rejoice in the rich diversity of its panoply  let us resolve to set aside the oneandahalfhurrahs syndrome once and for all and in its place raise three loud cheers recordingsedit on  august  george gouraud introduced thomas edisons phonograph to london in a press conference including the playing of a piano and cornet recording of sullivans the lost chord one of the first recordings of music ever made sullivan was invited to a party on  october  given to demonstrate the technology after dinner he recorded a speech to be sent to edison saying in part i can only say that i am astonished and somewhat terrified at the result of this evenings experiments astonished at the wonderful power you have developed and terrified at the thought that so much hideous and bad music may be put on record forever but all the same i think it is the most wonderful thing that i have ever experienced and i congratulate you with all my heart on this wonderful discovery these recordings

any jewish antecedents  between  and  sullivan worked as an organist at two fashionable london churches st michaels chester square pimlico and st peters cranley gardens kensington  grove described the discovery thus i found at the bottom of the cupboard and in its farthest corner a bundle of music books two feet high carefully tied round and black with the undisturbed dust of nearly halfacentury  there were the part books of the whole of the music in rosamunde tied up after the second performance in december  and probably never disturbed since dr schneider curator must have been amused at our excitement  at any rate he kindly overlooked it and gave us permission to  copy what we wanted  the work received an enthusiastic public reception but the musical times printed an early example of critical censure of sullivan for his accessibility the applause which it received was general and spontaneous but it may be a question whether if mr sullivan could not be requested to furnish a higher class of work he should not have been passed over altogether until a more fitting opportunity presented itself  this was for the merchant of venice at the princes theatre manchester sullivans earlier tempest music had been composed for the concert hall rather than theatrical performance although it was later used for at least one stage production  with a classical story and a mixture of political satire and grand opera parody thespis was reminiscent of orpheus in the underworld and la belle hélène by offenbach whose operettas were extremely popular on the english stage in both french and english la belle hélène entered the gaietys repertory eight weeks before the premiere of thespis sullivan may have been encouraged to write the music for thespis by hollingsheads offer of the role of apollo to the composers elder brother the comic actor and singer fred sullivan  the musical score of thespis was never published and is now lost except for one song that was published separately a

gives a complete list of sullivans hymns  carte conducted cox and box and some operettas on a tour in  managed by the composers brother fred who played cox cox and box again with fred as cox had been revived in  and arthur sullivan may have been considering a return to comic opera  the title page of the libretto describes trial as a dramatic cantata gilbert and sullivan insisted on calling the rest of their joint works operas often with a descriptive adjective such as a nautical comic opera jacobs p  an aesthetic opera or a japanese opera jacobs preface  in a study of the school and its successor the royal college of music david wright comments on sullivan he lacked any fresh perspective on musical training and any vision of what the ntsm needed to achieve if it was to make a mark  neither did sullivan have real sympathy with the society of arts progressive social ideals of scholarship education regardless of social origin despite having himself gained his education through scholarship support  gilbert sullivan and carte tried for many years to control the american performance copyrights over their operas but they were unable to do so  the viennese music critic eduard hanslick wrote of sullivans conducting of a mozart symphony sullivan presides on the podium from the comfortable recesses of a commodious armchair his left arm lazily extended on the armrest his right giving the beat in a mechanical way his eyes fastened on the score  sullivan never looked up from the notes it was as though he was reading at sight the heavenly piece plodded along for better or for worse listlessly insensibly bernard shaw who praised sullivan as a composer they trained him to make europe yawn and he took advantage of their teaching to make london and new york laugh and whistle commented under his bâton orchestras are never deficient in refinement coarseness exaggeration and carelessness are unacquainted with him so unfortunately are vigor and earnestness  gilbert replied it most certainly never occurred to me to look for any other reward than the honour of being associated however remotely and unworthily in a success which i suppose will endure until music itself shall die pray believe that of the many substantial advantages that have resulted to me from our association this last is and always will be the most highly prized  even after gilbert made changes but retained a magic lozenge that changed people into what they pretended to be sullivan could not accept it  the longestrunning piece of musical theatre was robert planquettes  opéracomique les cloches de corneville which held the record until alfred celliers operetta dorothy ran for  performances beginning in   king olaf caractacus and gerontius owe much to the golden legend – as via them does waltons belshazzars feast  gilbert wrote we have a name jointly for humorous work tempered with occasional glimpses of earnest drama i think we should do unwisely if we left altogether the path which we have trodden together so long and so successfully i can quite understand your desire to write a big work well why not write one but why abandon the savoy business cannot the two things be done concurrently if you can write an oratorio like the martyr of antioch while you are occupied by pieces like patience and iolanthe cant you write a grand opera without giving up pieces like the yeomen of the guard  sullivan continued i have lost the necessary nerve for it and it is not too much to say that it is distasteful to me the types used over and over again unavoidable in such a company as ours the grossmith part the middleaged woman with fading charms cannot again be clothed in music by me nor can i again write to any wildly improbable plot in which there is not some human interest  you say that in serious opera you must more or less sacrifice yourself i say that this is just what i have been doing in all our joint pieces and what is more must continue to do in comic opera to make it successful business and syllabic setting assume an importance which however much they fetter me cannot be overlooked i am bound in the interests of the piece to give way hence the reason of my wishing to do a work where the music is to be the first consideration – where words are to suggest music not govern it and where music will intensify and emphasize the emotional effects of the words  sullivans biographers and scholars of his work have censured tennysons text gervase hughes called it puerile rubbish percy young found it devoid of any kind of merit whatsoever sullivans music was initially wellreceived but sullivans biographers were not impressed one of sullivans lamest  resourceless in magic young not even one memorable number jacobs recent critics however have praised sullivans contribution  caryl brahms speculates that sullivans relationship with his friend the duke of edinburgh who was married included sex but the only evidence cited is unspecified victorian cartoonists  one such flirtation was with anna whom he met in paris in   in  fred appeared as cox in his brothers cox and box at the alhambra theatre and he toured as cox in his own production that summer later that year he played apollo in gilbert and sullivans thespis at the gaiety theatre remaining at the gaiety thereafter he took his own company on tour in the summer of  appearing in his brothers cox and box and the contrabandista and later that year he again played cox this time at the gaiety the next year he created the role of the learned judge in gilbert and sullivans trial by jury a role that he would play in london and on tour for the rest of his career  sullivan could also play the oboe and bassoon but less proficiently  gian andrea mazzucato wrote this glowing summary of sullivans career in the musical standard of  december  the english history of the th century could not record the name of a man whose life work is more worthy of honour study and admiration than the name of sir arthur sullivan  it is a debatable point whether the universal history of music can point to any musical personality since the days of haydn mozart and beethoven whose influence is likely to be more lasting than the influence the great englishman is slowly but surely exerting  i make no doubt that when in proper course of time sir arthur sullivans life and works have become known on the continent he will by unanimous consent be classed among the epochmaking composers the select few whose genius and strength of will empowered them to find and found a national school of music that is to endow their countrymen with the undefinable yet positive means of evoking in a mans soul by the magic of sound those delicate nuances of feeling which are characteristic of the emotional power of each different race  fuller maitland was later discredited when it was shown that he had invented a banal lyric passing it off as genuine and condemning sullivan for supposedly setting such inanity in  fuller maitland admitted that he had been wrong in earlier years to dismiss sullivans comic operas as ephemeral  the first was take a pair of sparkling eyes from the
