svenska handelsbanken svnly labutes ir longshort equity mutual fund manager foreign companies bankssummaryhandelsbanken is a retailfocused bank with a different business model than usual in the banking industryits lowrisk culture and high efficiency leads to very high profitability levels which are sustainable in the longtermdespite its recent dividend cut it offers a dividend yield of  that is sustainable in the longtermsvenska handelsbanken ab otcpksvnly is a highquality european bank with a different business model and culture it has a lowrisk culture which leads to very low loan losses and is one of the most efficient banks within the european banking sector this results in very high roe and capitalization providing a strong support for an attractive dividend however its recent dividend cut to pursue growth seems to be a significant change in the banks strategy despite this it offers a sustainable  yield making it interesting to income investors company description handelsbanken is based in sweden and is one of the leading nordic banks it was founded in  and has currently more than  branches in its six most important markets it provides banking services for corporate and private customers it is one of the few european banks with an aa credit rating has a market capitalization of about  billion and trades on the us in the overthecounter market its main competitors are other nordic banks such as nordea otcpknrbay danske otcpkdnsky or swedbank otcpkswdby despite its geographical diversification its domestic market continues to be the largest one for the bank internationally handelsbanken grows by establishing its business models in selected markets handelsbanken has better growth prospects in the uk and the netherlands where it has a low market share and can grow organically through new branches business model handelsbanken has a different business culture than all other banks with a decentralized way of working it abolished budgets in  considering that longterm plans risk creating unwanted incentives and behavior it has no sales targets focusing on profitability instead of volumes and does not pay bonuses given that it believes bonuses should be avoided in risktaking operations its branches are fully responsible for all customer relationships approving all credit and business transactions with the customers depending on the size of the credit some additional regional or central approvals may be required but the first approval is always at the branch level given this philosophy the banks focus is on the customers needs and not the sale of specific products therefore it does not perform any central marketing campaigns being made locally it also targets specific customers instead of being a massmarket bank handelsbanken tends to consistently focus on the most affluent segment of the population using its decentralized branch network and personal meetings to provide a superior service it has a low risk tolerance with a centralized and nonnegotiable credit policy its policy is the same in all markets and across the business cycle with credit decisions based on cash flow and repayment capacity of the customers taking into account this different business model handelsbanken is the only european bank that wants to maintain the current size of its branch network over the longterm while practically all of its peers are targeting digitalization as a mean to cut costs and reducing the number of branches handelsbanken is betting that old banking based on customer relationships will remain a sound business model in the future financial overview regarding its financial performance handelsbankens low risk culture leads to low earnings volatility highquality underwriting and a funding advantage relative to its peers its goal is to have higher profitability than the average of peer banks in its markets like its swedish peers one of its competitive advantages compared to other european banks is its superior credit quality this results in aboveaverage profitability levels which are sustainable in the longterm and justifies its premium valuation like many of its european peers handelsbanken has suffered over the past few years from the low interest rate environment this has pressured its revenues and in the last fiscal year handelsbankens net interest income increased by just  to about  billion even though it has reported lending growth the low interest rate environment is a strong headwind to revenues and its topline should report modest growth in the next few years one of handelsbankens distinctive factors is its efficiency being among the best in the european banking sector its costtoincome ci ratio has been below  for the past  years and was quite stable at about  over the past here years this figure is among the most efficient banks in europe and one important reason why its high profitability is sustainable in the longterm another structural factor supporting handelsbankens profitability is its superior credit quality this has remained robust with an unchanged loan loss ratio of only  basis points bps in  being inline with its recent historical average since  the banks loss ratio has been about  bps and should remain at these residual levels for the next few years given the banks strong underwriting track record given this positive operating backdrop handelsbankens net income remained relatively stable in  at about  billion its profitability measured by its return on equity roe ratio was  this profitability is among the best in the european banking sector and has been very stable over the past few years showing the sustainability of handelsbankens business model regarding its capitalization handelsbanken is one of the best capitalized banks in the world at the end of  its fully loaded core equity tier  fl cet ratio was  this ratio increased from  at the end of  showing that the bank is still building capital despite its superior capitalization even though its capital ratio seems extremely high the swedish banking regulator is very conservative and requires banks to have very high ratios indeed handelsbanken wants to keep a  to  buffer above the minimum regulatory ratio which is currently set by the swedish financial supervisory authority at  therefore handelsbanken has a smaller excess capital position than its fl cet ratio of  could suggest but it has a strong capitalization enabling it to provide an attractive dividend to its shareholders handelsbanken has a very good dividend history distributing a large part of its annual earnings to shareholders however after several years of dividend growth the bank surprised and recently announced a lower dividend related to  earnings than expected its total dividend was announced at sek   per share a decline of  from the previous year at its current share price handelsbanken offers a dividend yield of  its stock will trade exdividend on thursday  march  and the dividend should be paid in the next few days like many european companies its dividend payment frequency is annual additionally the swedish dividend withholding tax rate is  reducing a little bit the income appeal handelsbankens dividend payout ratio was  a lower level than in previous years when the bank dividend payout was above  and also lower than compared to its swedish peers the bank justifies this dividend cut due to its growth ambitions in international markets namely in the uk and the netherlands its guidance on the future dividend path is not clear but according to analysts estimates its dividend should recover in the next few years however given that managements preference seems to earmark any excess capital to pursue growth its dividend may surprise again negatively in the coming years conclusion handelsbanken is a highquality bank with a mature and reliable business model its good credit quality and efficiency lead to very high profitability levels which are sustainable over the longterm in the past one of its main positive points was its highdividend yield but its recent dividend cut was unexpected and may mark a new phase for the bank targeting growth instead of returning excess capital to shareholders nevertheless it still yields about  and has a sound business model in the longterm making it quite appealing to income investors disclosure iwe have
