as possible one limitation of rendering realistic images is that modern monitors display images through the use of pixelsa pixel is the smallest area of space which can be illuminated on a monitor most modern computer monitors will use a combination of hundreds of thousands or millions of pixels to compose the entire display or rendered scene the individual pixels are arranged in a grid pattern and collectively cover the entire viewing area of the monitor each individual pixel may be illuminated to render a final picture for viewingone technique for rendering a real world threedimensional scene onto a twodimensional monitor using pixels is called rasterization rasterization is the process of taking a twodimensional image represented in vector format mathematical representations of geometric objects within a scene and converting the image into individual pixels for display on the monitor rasterization is effective at rendering graphics quickly and using relatively low amounts of computational power however rasterization suffers from some drawbacks for example rasterization often suffers from a lack of realism because it is not based on the physical properties of light rather rasterization is based on the shape of threedimensional geometric objects in a scene projected onto a twodimensional plane furthermore the computational power required to render a scene with rasterization scales directly with an increase in the complexity of the scene to be rendered as image processing becomes more realistic rendered scenes also become more complex therefore rasterization suffers as image processing evolves because rasterization scales directly with complexityanother technique for rendering a real world threedimensional scene onto a twodimensional monitor using pixels is called ray tracing the ray tracing technique traces the propagation of imaginary rays rays which behave similar to rays of light into a threedimensional scene which is to be rendered onto a computer screen the rays originate from the eyes of a viewer sitting behind the computer screen and traverse through pixels which make up the computer screen towards the threedimensional scene each traced ray proceeds into the scene and may intersect with objects within the scene if a ray intersects an object within the scene properties of the object and several other contributing factors are used to calculate the amount of color and light or lack thereof the ray is exposed to these calculations are then used to determine the final color of the pixel through which the traced ray passedthe process of tracing rays is carried out many times for a single scene for example a single ray may be traced for each pixel in the display once a sufficient number of rays have been traced to determine the color of all of the pixels which make up the twodimensional display of the computer screen the twodimensional synthesis of the threedimensional scene can be displayed on the computer screen to the viewerray tracing typically renders real world threedimensional scenes with more realism than rasterization this is partially due to the fact that ray tracing simulates how light travels and behaves in a real world environment rather than simply projecting a threedimensional shape onto a twodimensional plane as is done with rasterization therefore graphics rendered using ray tracing more accurately depict on a monitor what our eyes are accustomed to seeing in the real worldfurthermore ray tracing also handles increases in scene complexity better than rasterization as scenes become more complex ray tracing scales logarithmically with scene complexity this is due to the fact that the same number of rays may be cast into a scene even if the scene becomes more complex therefore ray tracing does not suffer in terms of computational power requirements as scenes become more complex as rasterization doesone major drawback of ray tracing is the large number of calculations and thus processing power required to render scenes this leads to problems when fast rendering is needed for example when an image processing system is to render graphics for animation purposes such as in a game console due to the increased computational requirements for ray tracing it is difficult to render animation quickly enough to seem realistic realistic animation is approximately twenty to twentyfour frames per secondtherefore there exists a need for more efficient techniques and devices to perform ray tracingsummary of the inventionembodiments of the present invention generally provide

threedimensional scene  to be rendered by an image processing system within the threedimensional scene  may be objects  the objects  in fig  are of different geometric shapes although only four objects  are illustrated in fig  the number of objects in a typical threedimensional scene may be more or less commonly threedimensional scenes will have many more objects than illustrated in fig as can be seen in fig  the objects are of varying geometric shape and size for example one object in fig  is a pyramid a other objects in fig  are boxes bd in many modern image processing systems objects are often broken up into smaller geometric shapes eg squares circles triangles etc the larger objects are then represented by a number of the smaller simple geometric shapes these smaller geometric shapes are often referred to as primitivesalso illustrated in the scene  are light sources ab the light sources may illuminate the objects  located within the scene  furthermore depending on the location of the light sources  and the objects  within the scene  the light sources may cause shadows to be cast onto objects within the scene the threedimensional scene  may be rendered into a twodimensional picture by an image processing system the image processing system may also cause the twodimensional picture to be displayed on a monitor  the monitor  may use many pixels  of different colors to render the final twodimensional pictureone method used by image processing systems to render a threedimensional scene  into a twodimensional picture is called ray tracing ray tracing is accomplished by the image processing system “issuing” or “shooting” rays from the perspective of a viewer  into the threedimensional scene  the rays have properties and behavior similar to light raysone ray  that originates at the position of the viewer  and traverses through the threedimensional scene  can be seen in fig  as the ray  traverses from the viewer  to the threedimensional scene  the ray  passes through a plane where the final twodimensional picture will be rendered by the image processing system in fig  this plane is represented by the monitor  the point the ray  passes through the plane or monitor  is represented by a pixel as briefly discussed earlier most image processing systems use a grid  of thousands if not millions of pixels to render the final scene on the monitor  the grid  may be referred to as a frame each individual pixel may display a different color to render the final composite twodimensional picture on the monitor  an image processing system using a ray tracing image processing methodology to render a twodimensional picture from a threedimensional scene will calculate the colors that the issued ray or rays encounters in the threedimensional scene the image processing scene will then assign the colors encountered by the ray to the pixel through which the ray passed on its way from the viewer to the threedimensional scenethe number of rays issued per pixel may vary some pixels may have many rays issued for a particular scene to be rendered in which case the final color of the pixel is determined by the each color contribution from all of the rays that were issued for the pixel other pixels may only have a single ray issued to determine the resulting color of the pixel in the twodimensional picture some pixels may not have any rays issued by the image processing system in which case their color may be determined approximated or assigned by algorithms within the image processing systemto determine the final color of the pixel  in the twodimensional picture the image processing system must determine if the ray  intersects an object within the scene if the ray does not intersect an object within the scene it may be assigned a default background color eg blue or black representing the day or night sky conversely as the ray  traverses through the threedimensional scene the ray  may strike objects as the rays strike objects within the scene the color of the object may be assigned to the pixel through which the ray passes however the color of the object must be determined before it is assigned to the pixelmany factors may contribute to the color of the object struck by the original ray  for example light sources within the threedimensional scene may illuminate the object furthermore physical properties of the object may contribute to the color of the object for example if the object is reflective or transparent other nonlight source objects may then contribute to the color of the objectin order to determine the effects from other objects within the threedimensional scene secondary rays may be issued from the point where the original ray  intersected the object for example shadow rays  may be issued to determine the contribution of light to the point where the original ray  intersected the object if the object has translucent properties the image processing system may issue a transmitted ray  to determine what color or light to be transmitted through the body of the object if the object has reflective properties the image processing system may issue a reflected ray to determine what color or light is reflected onto the object one type of secondary ray may be a shadow ray each shadow ray may be traced from the point of intersection of the original ray and the object to a light source within the threedimensional scene  if the ray reaches the light source without encountering another object before the ray reaches the light source then the light source will illuminate the object struck by the original ray at the point where the original ray struck the objectfor example shadow ray a may be issued from the point where original ray  intersected the object a and may traverse in a direction towards the light source a the shadow ray a reaches the light source a without encountering any other objects  within the scene  therefore the light source a will illuminate the object a at the point where the original ray  intersected the object aother shadow rays may have their path between the point where the original ray struck the object and the light source blocked by another object within the threedimensional scene if the object obstructing the path between the point on the object the original ray struck and the light source is opaque then the light source will not illuminate the object at the point where the original ray struck the object thus the light source may not contribute to the color of the original ray and consequently neither to the color of the pixel to be rendered in the twodimensional picture however if the object is translucent or transparent then the light source may illuminate the object at the point where the original ray struck the objectfor example shadow ray b may be issued from the point where the original ray  intersected with the object a and may traverse in a direction towards the light source b in this example the path of the shadow ray b is blocked by an object d if the object d is opaque then the light source b will not illuminate the object a at the point where the original ray  intersected the object a however if the object d which the shadow ray is translucent or transparent the light source b may illuminate the object a at the point where the original ray  intersected the object aanother type of secondary ray is a transmitted ray a transmitted ray may be issued by the image processing system if the object with which the original ray intersected has transparent or translucent properties eg glass a transmitted ray traverses through the object at an angle relative to the angle at which the original ray struck the object for example transmitted ray  is seen traversing through the object a which the original ray  intersectedanother type of secondary ray is a reflected ray if the object with which the original ray intersected has reflective properties eg a metal finish then a reflected ray will be issued by the image processing system to determine what color or light may be reflected onto the object reflected rays traverse away from the object at an angle relative to the angle at which the original ray intersected the object for example reflected ray  may be issued by the image processing system to determine what color or light may be reflected onto the object a which the original ray  intersectedthe total contribution of color and light of all secondary rays eg shadow rays transmitted rays reflected rays etc will result in the final color of the pixel through which the original ray passedan exemplary kdtreeone problem encountered when performing ray tracing is determining quickly and efficiently if an issued ray intersects any objects within the scene to be rendered one methodology known by those of ordinary skill in the art to make the ray intersection determination more efficient is to use a spatial index a spatial index divides a threedimensional scene or world into smaller volumes smaller relative to the entire threedimensional scene which may or may not contain primitives an image processing system can then use the known boundaries of these smaller volumes to determine if a ray may intersect primitives contained within the smaller volumes if a ray does intersect a volume containing primitives then a ray intersection test can be run using the trajectory of the ray against the known location and dimensions of the primitives contained within that volume if a ray does not intersect a particular volume then there is no need to run rayprimitive intersection tests against the primitives contained within that volume furthermore if a ray intersects a bounding volume which does not contain primitives then there is no need to run rayprimitive intersections tests against that bounding volume thus by reducing the number of rayprimitive intersection tests which may be necessary the use of a spatial index greatly increases the performance of a ray tracing image processing system some examples of different spatial index acceleration data structures are octrees k dimensional trees kdtrees and binary space partitioning trees bsp trees while several different spatial index structures exist for ease of describing embodiments of the present invention a kdtree will be used in the examples to follow however those skilled in the art will readily recognize that embodiments of the invention may be applied to any of the different types of spatial indexesa kdtree uses axis aligned bounding volumes to partition the entire scene or space into smaller volumes that is the kdtree may divide a threedimensional space encompassed by a scene through the use of splitting planes which are parallel to known axes the splitting planes partition a larger space into smaller bounding volumes together the smaller bounding volumes make up the entire space in the scene the determination to partition divide a larger bounding volume into two smaller bounding volumes may be made by the image processing system through the use of a kdtree construction algorithmone criterion for determining when to partition a bounding volume into smaller volumes may be the number of primitives contained within the bounding volume that is as long as a bounding volume contains more primitives than a predetermined threshold the tree construction algorithm may continue to divide volumes by drawing more splitting planes another criterion for determining when to partition a bounding volume into smaller volumes may be the amount of space contained within the bounding volume furthermore a decision to continue partitioning the bounding volume may also be based on how many primitives may be intersected by the plane which creates the bounding volumethe partitioning of the scene may be represented by a binary tree structure made up of nodes branches and leaves each internal node within the tree may represent a relatively large bounding volume while the node may contain branches to subnodes which may represent two relatively smaller partitioned volumes resulting after a partitioning of the relatively large bounding volume by a splitting plane in an axisaligned kdtree each internal node may contain only two branches to other nodes the internal node may contain branches ie pointers to one or two leaf nodes a leaf node is a node which is not further subdivided into smaller volumes and contains pointers to primitives an internal node may also contain branches to other internal nodes which are further subdivided an internal node may also contain the information needed to determine along what axis the splitting plane was drawn and where along the axis the splitting plane was drawnexemplary bounding volumesfigs ac illustrate a twodimensional space to be rendered by an image processing system and a corresponding kdtree for simplicity a twodimensional scene is used to illustrate the building of a kdtree however kdtrees may also be used to represent threedimensional scenes in the twodimensional illustration of figs ac splitting lines are illustrated instead of splitting planes and bounding areas are illustrated instead of bounding volumes as would be used in a threedimensional structure however one skilled in the art will quickly recognize that the concepts may easily be applied to a threedimensional scene containing objectsfig a illustrates a twodimensional scene  containing primitives  to be rendered in the final picture to be displayed on a monitor  the largest volume which represents the entire volume of the scene is encompassed by bounding volume  bv in the corresponding kdtree this may be represented by the top level node  also known as the root or world node in one embodiment of an image processing system an image processing system may continue to partition bounding volumes into smaller bounding volumes when the bounding volume contains for example more than two primitives as noted earlier the decision to continue partitioning a bounding volume into smaller bounding volumes may be based on many factors however for ease of explanation in this example the decision to continue partitioning a bounding volume is based only on the number of primitives as can be seen in fig a bv contains six primitives therefore kdtree construction algorithm may partition bv into smaller bounding volumesfig b illustrates the same twodimensional scene  as illustrated in fig a however in fig b the tree construction algorithm has partitioned bv into two smaller bounding volumes bv and bv the partitioning of bv was accomplished by drawing a splitting plane sp  along the xaxis at point x this partitioning of bv is also reflected in the kdtree as the two nodes  and  corresponding to bv and bv respectively under the internal or parent node bv  the internal node representing bv may now store information such as but not limited to pointers to the two nodes beneath bv eg bv and bv along which axis the splitting plane was drawn eg xaxis and where along the axis the splitting plane was drawn eg at point xthe kdtree construction algorithm may continue to partition bounding volume bv because it contains more than the predetermined threshold of primitives eg more than two primitives however the kdtree construction algorithm may not continue to partition bounding volume bv because bounding volume bv contains less than or equal to the number of primitives eg only two primitives a nodes which are not partitioned or subdivided any further such as bv are referred to as leaf nodesfig c illustrates the same twodimensional scene  as illustrated in fig b however in fig c the kdtree construction algorithm has partitioned bv into two smaller bounding volumes bv and bv the kdconstruction algorithm has partitioned bv using a partitioning plane along the yaxis at point y since bv has been partitioned into two subnodes it may now be referred to as an internal node the partitioning of bv is also reflected in the kdtree as the two leaf nodes  and  corresponding to bv and bv respectively bv and bv are leaf nodes because the volumes they represent are not further divided into smaller bounding volumes the two leaf nodes bv and bv are located under the internal node bv which represents the bounding volume which was partitioned in the kdtreethe internal node representing bv may store information such as but not limited to pointers to the two leaf nodes ie bv and bv along which axis the splitting plane was drawn ie yaxis and where along the axis the splitting plane was drawn ie at point ythe kdtree construction algorithm may now stop partitioning the bounding volumes because all bounding volumes located within the scene contain less than or equal to the maximum predetermined number of primitives which may be enclosed within a bounding volume the leaf nodes may contain pointers to the primitives which are enclosed within the bounding volumes each leaf represents for example leaf node bv may contain pointers to primitives a leaf node bv may contain pointers to primitives b and leaf node bv may contain pointers to primitives ca ray tracing image processing system may use the workload manager  to traverse the spatial index kdtree traversing the kdtree may include selecting a branch to a node on a lower level subnode of the kdtree to take or proceed to in order to determine if the ray intersects any primitives contained within the subnode a workload manager  may use the coordinates and trajectory of an issued ray to traverse or navigate through the kdtree by executing raybounding volume intersection tests the workload manager  may determine if the ray intersects a plane of the bounding volumes represented by nodes within the kdtree structure if the ray intersects a bounding volume which contains only primitives ie a leaf node then the workload manager  may send the ray and associated information to a vector throughput engine  for rayprimitive intersection tests a rayprimitive intersection test may be executed to determine if the ray intersects the primitives within the bounding volume this methodology results in fewer rayprimitive intersection tests needed to determine if a ray intersects an object within the scene in comparison to running rayprimitive intersection tests for a ray against each primitive contained within the scenethe resulting kdtree structure or other spatial index structure may be stored in a processor cache  the kdtree and the size of corresponding data which comprises the kdtree may be optimized for storage in a processor cache  the storage of the kdtree in a processor cache  may allow a workload manager  to traverse the kdtree with a ray that has been issued by the image processing system without having to retrieve the kdtree from memory every time a ray is issued by the image processing systemmultiple spatial indexesthreedimensional scenes may have static and dynamic objects static objects may be objects that do not move or change shape over a relatively long period of time eg for several frames for example a building may be considered a static object fig  illustrates an exemplary building  within a threedimensional scene  the building  in fig  is a static object because it may not move or change shape over a relatively long period of timein contrast a dynamic object may move or change shape over a relatively short period of time eg over a period of a frame or two a car may be an example of a dynamic object for example fig  illustrates a car  which may move horizontally within the threedimensional scene  over a relatively short period of timeas described previously an image processing system may use a spatial index eg a kdtree to render a twodimensional image ie a frame from a threedimensional scene if the scene changes eg objects in the scene move or change shape the image processing system may have to change or rebuild the spatial index which represents the objects within the threedimensional scene in order to correctly render the next twodimensional image or frameif all of the objects within the threedimensional scene are static ie the do not change shape or move from frame to frame the spatial index does not have to be rebuilt from frame to frame however if the image processing system only uses a single spatial index for ray tracing and some objects within the frame move or change shape from one frame to the next the spatial index needs to be rebuilt to correctly represent the changes in the objects which make up the scene for example when a dynamic object moves from a first position in a first frame to a second position in a second frame a spatial index which represents the first position of the object in the first frame may not correctly represent the second position of the object in the second frame therefore the spatial index may need to be rebuilt to correctly represent the second position of the object in the second framerebuilding the entire spatial index by the image processing system may require a considerable amount of processing cycles and thus increasing the overall amount of time required to render a twodimensional image from a threedimensional scene even if only a minimal portion of the threedimensional scene changes however according to one embodiment of the invention two separate spatial indexes may be built in order to reduce the amount of time necessary to respond to changes in position or shape of objects in the threedimensional scene by reducing the amount of time necessary to respond to changes the amount of time necessary to render a twodimensional image from a threedimensional scene may be reduced as wellfig  illustrates two separate spatial indexes which together may represent all objects within a threedimensional scene according to one embodiment of the invention a first index may be for example a static spatial index a which may represent all of the static objects within a threedimensional scene a second spatial index may be for example a dynamic spatial index a which may represent dynamic objects within a threedimensional scene according to one embodiment of the inventionfor illustrative purposes the threedimensional scene to which the static spatial index corresponds may be the threedimensional scene  of fig  therefore the static spatial index a may represent the static object the building  in the threedimensional scene  of fig  furthermore the dynamic spatial index a may correspond to the dynamic object ie the car  in the threedimensional scene  of fig an image processing system using a workload manager  to traverse a spatial index may store the spatial index in a memory cache of a processing element eg the memory cache  of fig  storage of a spatial index in a memory cache may expedite the traversal of a ray through the spatial index by reducing time necessary for a workload manager  to access data stored in the spatial index according to one embodiment of the invention the static spatial index a and the dynamic spatial index a may be stored in separate portions of a memory cache by storing the static spatial index and the dynamic spatial index in separate portions of a memory cache the dynamic spatial index may be updated without affecting the static spatial indexfig  illustrates storing spatial indexes in separate portions of a memory cache  for example the static spatial index a may be stored in a first portion  of the memory cache  the dynamic spatial index a may be stored in a second portion  of the spatial indexthe image processing system may be used for example in conjunction with other systems which control the movement of objects within the threedimensional scene for example the image processing system may be used in conjunction with a physics engine in a video game system the physics engine may move objects within the threedimensional scene and the image processing system may render multiple images or frames per second which illustrate the new or moved positions of the objects within the scene thus the image processing system and the physics engine may together provide animationthe image processing system may determine that it is time to update the static spatial index for example if objects which were once considered static objects move or change shape and hence need to be considered dynamic objects rather than static objects furthermore it may be time to update the static spatial index for example if objects which were once dynamic are no longer moving or changing shape and now may be considered static objects although at times the image processing system may determine that the static spatial index may need to be updated the frequency of this determination may be lower than the frequency of the need to update the dynamic spatial index for example a new dynamic spatial index may need to be created from frame to frame whereas a static spatial index may only need to be updated after sixty frames have passedfor example fig  illustrates the threedimensional scene  which was also illustrated in fig  however the dynamic object in the threedimensional scene  ie the car  has moved from a first position a in the threedimensional scene  to a new position b however the static object ie the building  has remained in the same position consequently in order to properly represent the new threedimensional scene  a new dynamic spatial index may be created by the image processing system according to embodiments of the invention the new dynamic spatial index may reflect the movement of the dynamic objects within the scene ie the car  in contrast according to embodiments of the intervention since the static objects have not changed position in the threedimensional scene  the static spatial index which was created to represent to the static objects present in fig  correctly represents the static objects present in fig therefore instead of rebuilding a single spatial index which represents all objects ie static and dynamic within the entire threedimensional scene in response to movement of the dynamic objects within the scene only the dynamic spatial index must be rebuilt to correspond to the movement of objects within the threedimensional scene rebuilding a spatial index which only represents a portion of the objects within the threedimensional scene ie the dynamic spatial index may require less time in contrast to rebuilding a spatial index which represents all of the objects ie dynamic and staticafter the image processing system has created a new dynamic spatial index b the image processing system may store the new dynamic spatial index b in the dynamic spatial index portion  of the memory cache fig  illustrates the memory cache  which was used to store the dynamic and spatial indexes which represented fig  however the image processing system has since replaced the dynamic spatial index corresponding to the old position or shape of objects within the threedimensional scene with a new dynamic spatial index for example a new dynamic spatial index b which may represent the new position b of the car  the new dynamic spatial index b may differ only slightly from the dynamic spatial index a which represented the initial position a of the car  as illustrated in fig  the difference between the old dynamic spatial index and the new dynamic spatial index is a portion b of the dynamic spatial index b this portion b of the dynamic spatial index may correspond to the change in position of the car b from the first position a to the second position balso illustrated in fig  is the static spatial index a the static spatial index a has not changed from fig  to fig  because the static object ie the building  has not changed position or shape in the threedimensional scene cache invalidation with data dependent expiration using a step valueaccording to embodiments of the invention a memory cache may contain multiple data structures each of which may be updated or invalidated at various times for example as described above a memory cache in an image processing system may contain both a dynamic spatial index and a static spatial index furthermore the memory cache may have a dynamic portion where the dynamic spatial index is stored and a static portion where the static spatial index is stored in some circumstances it may be desirable to store the dynamic spatial index and static spatial index separately such that the portion of memory which stores the dynamic spatial index may be periodically invalidated while keeping the static portion of the memory cache validperiodic invalidation of the dynamic portion of the spatial index may be performed in anticipation that a new dynamic spatial index corresponding to new positions of objects eg due to movement or collision within the threedimensional scene may be used by the image processing system by periodically invalidating the dynamic portion of the spatial index the risk of a processing element using invalid data is reducedinvalidation of a data structure eg the dynamic spatial index in a memory cache may require an application to issue a large number of cache invalidate instructions in order to invalidate each line of the cache which contains data related to the data structure the large number of invalidate instructions may consume a large amount of processing bandwidth and powerin some circumstances a data structure eg the dynamic spatial index may be stored within the cache memory of multiple processing elements in a multiple processor environment for example the dynamic spatial index may be stored within the l memory cache  of each of the processing cores  in the multiple core processor  illustrated in fig cache coherency may be necessary in a multiple processing core system when the caches of the various processor cores may contain data which relates to the same main memory address cache coherency may enable the system to avoid situations where different versions of data corresponding to a main memory address are located within separate memory caches and one processor might use an old or invalid version of the data for example one processor may update the a portion of the dynamic spatial index within its own cache while another processor may contain old data corresponding to the same portion of the dynamic spatial index within its cache and attempts to use the old datain some circumstances cache coherency may be maintained by hardware and accomplished for example using a snooping bus protocol eg mesi protocol using a snooping bus protocol each processor cache may monitor bus transactions for writes to memory at an address location which contains data present within the processors cache although snooping bus protocols may effectively maintain cache coherency when a periodic data structure eg dynamic spatial index is frequently invalidated many bus transactions may be generated each time new data relating to the data structure is written to a processor cache thus periodic invalidation of a data structure contained within a plurality of processor caches using a standard cache coherency protocol eg mesi protocol may result in the consumption of a large amount of processing bandwidth and powerhowever according to embodiments of the invention portions of a memory cache may be periodically updated and the number of bus transactions relating to updating the data structure minimized by associating step values with data which forms the data structure and by using and a modified cache coherency protocol the modified cache coherency protocol may be referred to as a stepinterval cache coherency protocolusing the step value in conjunction with the stepinterval cache coherency protocol to update portions of the memory cache eliminates the need to perform thousands if not millions of cache invalidate instructions when a data structure needs to be invalidated the elimination of the need to perform these invalidate instructions may allow a processing element or elements to perform other tasks eg image processing tasks and consequently may improve the performance of the system eg a raytracing image processing systemaccording to embodiments of the invention step values may be associated or stored with data stored within cache memory step values may be for example an integer value and may be used to determine if the associated data which resides within a memory cache is current by comparing a stored step value with a current step value additionally the current step value may be altered eg incremented to invalidate data which is associated or stored with an old step value the step value may be associated with data which forms a portion of a data structure eg the dynamic spatial index or the static spatial indexaccording to embodiments of the invention in conjunction with the normal address tag and state comparison in the cache the current step value and the step value associated with data within the cache may be compared the current step value may be specified in a register within the memory cache and the step value associated with data within the cache may be located within the cache directory containing the valid bits and address tag associated with the data within the memory cache if the current step value and the step value associated with data match a cache hit occurs and the data stored within the cache memory associated with the address may be returned to the processor however if the current step value and a step value associated with the data do not match a cache miss occurs and the data must be retrieved from another source by associating a step value with data within the data structure and using the step value during the cache compare the cache may quickly determine if data within the cache is current in addition by modifying eg updating the current step value an application may quickly invalidate all data stored within cache memory which is associated with an old step value or values without needing to issue invalidate instructionsfurthermore according to embodiments of the invention the stepinterval cache coherency protocol may be used to control when data associated with a new version of a data structure is shared with other processors and thus written to other cache memory the stepinterval cache coherency protocol may be used in conjunction with the step values in order to periodically update a data structure within the cache memory an application may use the stepinterval cache coherency protocol to write an entire data structure to cache memory before the data structure is to be used by other processors for example the image processing system may use the stepinterval cache coherency protocol to write a new version of a dynamic spatial index corresponding to a future frame to the cache before the dynamic spatial index is to be used by the image processing system to render the frameaccording to embodiments of the invention when a miss occurs on a write to the cache memory under the stepinterval cache coherency protocol the logic within the cache memory may store the data from the write locally but may not allow coherency between the writer processor cache and other caches by not allowing coherency on a cache miss caused by a write to the cache memory the stepinterval cache coherency protocol may prevent the other caches from snooping the data which was written to the cache however on cache misses due to a read request the stepinterval cache coherency protocol may allow coherency between caches by allowing cache coherency on a read miss the stepinterval cache coherency protocol may allow data for a new version of the data structure to be retrieved from other sources eg cache memory for other processors main memory etcfig  is a flowchart which illustrates an exemplary method  of writing data to a memory cache and associating a step value with the data according to embodiments of the invention the method begins at step  for example when an application or a system determines a data structure needs to be stored in cache memory for example the image processing system may determine a need for a dynamic spatial index to be stored in cache memory in order to perform image processingnext at step  according to one embodiment of the invention the application may designate a writing processing element the writing processing element may perform all of the writes of data associated with the data structure which is to be used by the application the writing processing element may write the data into its cache memory eg l cache memoryfor example fig  illustrates an exemplary multiple core processor  containing four processor cores ad as illustrated each processor core  contains cache memory ie an l cache  one core processor a may be designated as the writing processor core by an application eg the image processing system and may write data corresponding to the data structure to its cache memory eg l cache  as explained further below and illustrated in fig  the writer processor core a may have a current step value of  within its memory cache while reader processor cores bd may have a current step value of  within their memory cachesalthough embodiments are described herein as using a single processing element or processor core to write data which corresponds to the data structure other embodiments of the invention are envisioned which may use a plurality of processing elements to write data corresponding to the data structure to a plurality of memory cachesnext at step  the application may mark the page address range for a data structure which is to be written into the data cache by the writer processor to indicate the stepinterval cache coherency protocol is to be used as described below this may be accomplished by updating data coherence mode bits associated with an address range for the data structure which is to be written to the data cacheaccording to embodiments of the invention a periodic data structure or a group of data structures may be identified by an address range the address range may be specified for example within the memory management unit mmu logic of the processor alternatively a register may be added to the processor which specifies an address range for the data structure according to one embodiment of the invention the address range register may be located within a cache controller of the cache memoryfig  illustrates an exemplary cache memory  containing a cache directory  cache data store  and a cache controller  as illustrated in fig  the cache controller  may contain registers  which may contain address ranges for a plurality of data structures the data cache may be for example an l cache  of a processor core  illustrated in fig  a first bus  and a second bus  are also illustrated in fig  the first bus  and the second bus  may connect the processor with the cache memory  and with other processing cores and memory cachesas illustrated a plurality of address ranges may be specified by a plurality of registers within the cache controller  according to embodiments of the invention each address range specified by an address range register may correspond to a single data structure or a group of data structures which may be defined by a plurality of rows within the cache data store by identifying various data structures through the use of a separate address range registers within the cache controller the various data structures may be invalidated at different times furthermore by associating a step value with an address range which corresponds to a data structure or a group of data structures an entire data structure or group of data structures may be invalidated by updating the current step value associated with an address range as will be further described below similarly if the address ranges for various data structures are defined within the mmu logic of a processor distinct step values may be associated with the address ranges within the mmu logicfor example the dynamic spatial index may be associated with a first address range register while the static spatial index may be associated with a second address range specified by a second address range register consequently the dynamic spatial index may be invalidated by updating the current step value associated with the first address range in the cache controller  while the static spatial index may remain current by not modifying the current step value associated with the second address range in the cache controllerassociated with each address range may be several attribute bits these bits may be used by the processor or logic within the data cache to determine how to handle reads from and writes to portions of a periodic data structure within the corresponding address range a first attribute bit or set of attribute bits may be a data coherence mode bit or bits the data coherence mode bits may specify if real time cache coherence or step interval cache coherence is to be used when reading data from or writing data to the periodic data structure real time coherence may be accomplished using a commonly known cache coherency protocol eg mesi cache coherency protocol in contrast step interval cache coherence may be used as described above and according to embodiments of the inventiona second bit or set of bits may be used to specify a step value for the data the step value associated with data within the memory cache may be used along with a current step value to determine if the data is current the step value associated with the data within the data cache may be thought of as a version of the data within the data cachefor example as illustrated in fig  the registers  located within the cache controller  of the cache memory  may contain a data coherence mode bit or a set of data coherence mode bits and a current step value bit or a set of current step value bits thus the application may mark the page address for the data structure for stepinterval coherence at step  for example by updating the cache coherence mode bits in a cachecontroller register which corresponds to the address range for the data structurein addition to updating the coherency mode bits for the address range corresponding to the data structure at step  the application may also update a step value current step value which is to be associated with the data which is written into the data cache this updated step value which may written with the data may be used to identify a new version of the data and consequently a new version of the data structure which is to be written into the cache memory by the processor the application may set the step value for the data structure for example by updating the step value bits in a cachecontroller register which corresponds to the address range for the data structurefor example the image processing system may currently be using a first version of the dynamic spatial index to perform image processing however in anticipation of performing image processing for a future frame the image processing system may use a writer processor to write a future version of the dynamic spatial index into the data cache the first version of the dynamic spatial index may be stored within the memory cache of reader processors and the cache directory lines or entries corresponding to the data within the first version of the dynamic spatial index may have step values equal to  in order to indicate the data which is to be written to the memory cache of the writer processor corresponds to the next version of the dynamic spatial index the image processing system may update the current step value in the cache controller of the writer processor consequently a step value of  may be written into the cache directory lines of data which makes up the new version of the dynamic spatial index as the writer processor writes the data into the cache memoryfor example as illustrated in fig  the writer processor core a may have a current step value of  within its memory cache while reader processor cores bd may have a current step value of  and a step value of  within the cache directory entries associated with data within the reader processor memory cachesnext at step  the application may write the data for the data structure into the data cache as data for the data structure is written into the data cache the current step value on the writer processor may be written into cache directory entries within the cache directory although various configurations of cache directory entries may be used along with the current step value a cache directory entry may also include state bits eg valid bit and bits which identify the data eg an address tag stored within the cache data store according to one embodiment of the inventionfor example as illustrated in fig  each cache directory entry may be defined by or contain a step value  a state  and an address tag  each cache directory entry may correspond to a data entry within the cache data store  of the cache memory  furthermore as illustrated in fig  the current step value of  may be associated with data eg written to cache directory entries written to the cache memory l cache  of the writer processor core a although the cache directory entries are illustrated in fig  as having address tag bits it should be understood that embodiments of the invention may be applied to any cache configuration including fully associative caches and set associative cachesas the data is written to the memory cache of the writer processor a cache miss may occur if the step value being written to the data cache does not match the step value within the cache directory entry local step value according to embodiments of the invention when using the stepinterval cache coherency protocol cache misses on writes to the cache of the writer processor will cause a bus transaction of read ie cacheable but noncoherent the cacheable but noncoherent status of the cache miss on a write will allow the writer processor to write the new data structure to the data cache and prevent other caches from snooping the write to the cache ie accessing the data written into the cache by treating misses on writes as reads a processor may write an entire new data structure to the data cache before the data structure is to be used by other data caches thus the new data structure may be written in its entirety and present within the cache when the applications needs to use the new data structure eg the next frame of image processingafter the application is finished writing data for the data structure into the cache at step  the application may make the data within the writer processor cache coherent across all caches the time to make the data structures coherent may be determined by the period which a new data structure is required by the applicationfor example an application such as an image processing system may require a new dynamic spatial index for each new frame to be rendered an image processing system may render a new frame once every th of a second therefore after writing new data into a data cache corresponding to a new dynamic spatial index the image processing system may determine once every th of a second to make the other caches coherent with the cache containing the new or updated dynamic spatial indexaccording to embodiments of the invention the application may make the caches coherent using one of several techniques first the application may make the data within the caches coherent by flushing all of the data which corresponded to the data structure from cache memory of the writer processor back to memory this may be accomplished for example by issuing a cache flush instruction for each line of the cache structure that contains updated data eg each line which pertains to the new version of the data structure such that cache sends the updated data entry or entries to a globally visible memory location or locations eg shared l cache  main memory etc alternatively the application may make the caches coherent by initiating a hardware engine flush to send lines in the cache back to globally visible memory according to embodiments of the invention the hardware engine flush may send all of the lines in the cache back to main memory may send only the lines which contain data relating to the updated data structure or send only the lines which only contain modified datahowever as described below with respect to fig  the application may make all caches coherent by not doing anything at step  rather the application may rely on the stepinterval cache coherency protocol to make the caches coherent by responding to cache misses in the reader cachesnext at step  the application may update a current step value within a register which resides in each processor which may use the data structure ie reader processor the processor may update the current step value within each cache memory by sending messages from the writer processor or thread to threads on the reader processors the application may update the step value to correspond to the step value which was used when writing data corresponding to a new data structure into cache memory of a writer processorfor example if at step  the application wrote data to the data cache of the writing processor with a step value of  then at step  the application may update the current step value in each processor which may use the data structure to a value of  fig  illustrates the current step value stored within the memory cache of each reader processor bd updated from a value of  to a value of by updating the step value in the register of all processors which may use data within the data structure the application effectively invalidates all data within processor caches eg reader processor caches which is associated with a nonmatching step value the data may be effectively invalidated because when the cache controller compares the current step value eg  with an old step value associated with data within the cache directory eg  the values will not match and the cache controller may consider the comparison a missnext at step  the application may perform or issue reads in processors to addresses within the address range of the data structure an exemplary method of performing reads using the step value and the realtime coherency protocol is described further below with respect to fig fig  is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary method  of performing reads from a data cache using a step value and the stepinterval cache coherency protocol according to embodiments of the invention the method  begins at step  when a processing element places an address on a bus in response to an instruction which requires data from memory eg load instruction the address placed on the bus may be used by the memory cache to determine if data corresponding to the address is stored within the memory cacheonce the cache receives the address from the processor at step  the cache controller may compare the address to an address range register within the cache controller to determine if the address is within an address range corresponding to a data structure if so at step  the cache controller may retrieve the data coherence mode the data group id and the current step value associated with the data structure specified by the register the data coherence mode may indicate that the stepinterval cache coherency protocol is to be used and the current step value may be the current step value updated by the writer processing element in step  of method  by saving the attribute bits within the cache controller no modification to the read instruction or instruction logic is necessaryonce the cache controller retrieves the attribute bits related to the address for the data structure the cache controller may compare various information to determine if current data related to the address of the instruction is located within the memory cache according to one embodiment of the invention in addition to a comparison of the address provided by the processor and the address tag within the cache directory the cache controller may also examine or compare the state bits of a matching cache directory entry with a known good state to determine if the data within the cache which corresponds to the cache directory entry is valid furthermore according to embodiments of the invention at step  the cache controller may compare the step value bits retrieved from the cache directory entry with the current step value bits retrieved from the register within the cache controller the comparison of the step value bits which are stored within the cache directory entry with the current step value bits retrieved from the register may indicate whether or not the data within the cache is currentnext at step  the cache controller may determine if a cache hit or a cache miss occurs the cache hit or miss determination may be based on the results of the comparison of the address values the state tags and the step values associated with the data located at the address requested by the processor if any of the compared bits do not match or the data is invalid a cache miss occurs and the cache controller proceed to step  however if the current state bits match the data is valid and the address tag matches a cache hit occurs and the cache controller may proceed to step after a cache hit at step  the cache controller may provide data from the data cache to the processor via a bus in contrast if a cache miss occurs at step  data may be provided to the processor from another source for example according to one embodiment of the invention when using the stepinterval cache coherency protocol when a cache miss due to a read request occurs data may be provided from the cache of the writer processor to the processor which requested the data subsequently the data provided by the writer processor may be written into the data cache of the requesting processor and a corresponding cache directory may be created containing the current step value consequently the data structure may be updated as needed by the cache of the writing processoralternatively according to another embodiment of the invention when a cache miss due to a read request occurs data may be provided to the requesting processor from globally visible memory eg the shared l cache or main memory the requested data may be present in the globally visible memory for example due to a cache flush executed in step  of method  as the data is provided from a globally visible memory the data may be written into the data cache of the requesting processor along with the current step valuealthough the step value may sufficiently invalidate data within the memory cache from one increment of the step value to the next a problem may exist if the number of step values is finite and at some point the application reuses step values if the application reuses the step values in some circumstances an old data cache entry associated with an old step value may remain within the cache until the application reuses the old step value consequently a cache hit may occur when the application reuses the old step value and invalid data may be returned to the requesting processorhowever according to embodiments of the invention a scrubber may be used to invalidate the old data within the memory cache the scrubber may be a hardware unit or a software routine which invalidates old cache lines within the cache which are associated with old step valuesaccording to one embodiment of the invention the scrubber function may read each cache line within the cache directory and check the step value associated with each cache directory entry upon encountering a cache directory entry containing a step value which does not match the current step value the scrubber function may invalidate the corresponding memory cache entry by setting the valid bit of the cache directory entry for example to ‘’ consequently any attempted access to the cache entry that has been invalidated by the scrubber function will cause a cache miss thus by invalidating the cache directory entries which contain old step values the scrubber function may ensure that old data within the memory cache is not accessed in the futurethe rate at which the scrubber function reads the rows within the cache directory may be programmable and may be adjusted such that the scrubber may examine and invalidate all cache directory entries before a step value is reused by the application consequently if the application uses many step values the scrubber function may operate more slowly than if the application uses very few step valuesalthough the embodiments of the invention for updating and invalidating memory cache are herein described with reference to a portion of a memory cache which contains a dynamic spatial index it should be understood that the invention is not limited to invalidating cache memory areas which only contain dynamic spatial indexes instead any portion of a memory cache containing any type of data whether related to image processing or not may be invalidated by the methods and apparatus described hereinfurthermore although the current step value is herein described as being stored within the cache controller of a memory cache the examples given above are for purposes of description and the invention is not limited to specific described embodiments embodiments of the invention are envisioned in which the current step value may be stored elsewhere within a processor coreconclusionaccording to embodiments of the invention a step value and a stepinterval cache coherency protocol may be used to update and invalidate data stored within cache memory according to embodiments of the invention a step value may be stored within a cache directory entry associated with data in the memory cache upon reception of a cache read request along with the normal address comparison to determine if the data is located within the cache a current step value may be compared with the stored step value to determine if the data is current if the step values match the data may be current and a cache hit may occur however if the step values do not match the requested data may be provided from another source according to embodiments of the invention an application may update the current step value effectively invalidating old data stored within the cache and associated with a different step value by updating the current step value to invalidate data stored within the cache memory embodiments of the invention eliminate the need to perform many cache invalidate instructionswhile the foregoing is directed to embodiments of the present invention
