everyone is underweighted in valuemarket history shows that applying a low pe value discipline to stock selection has rewarded investors with such powerful longterm results it seems inconceivable that they can be underweighted in the strategy the reason is that in a meltup market like the one we just experienced growth stocks and index funds increasingly get bid up over value stocks as the market becomes less and less concerned about risk and valuation however once a meltup market ends a period follows where value dramatically outperforms for a long time below you can see how year after year

reached a point in the market where risk is being increasingly ignored by many investors evidence for what is going on can be seen in the pe multiples of some popular stocks facebook at x earnings
