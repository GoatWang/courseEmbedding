and vivaldi asset management llc  download as pdf  federal register  vol  no   friday march    notices jstallworth on dsktptvnprod with notices requiring price improvement before the order can receive priority over other orders’’  the exchange believes the procedures governing the execution of fully hedged complex orders serve to reduce the risk of incomplete or inadequate executions while increasing efficiency and competitive pricing by requiring price improvement before the order can receive priority over other orders in addition making explicit the open outcry priority applicable when there are other complex orders or quotes represented at the same net price whether such other orders or quotes are in the cob or being represented in open outcry provides added clarity to the rule text in a manner that is consistent with the existing methodology applicable for prioritizing multiple simple orders for open outcry trading and how the exchange has interpreted and applied complex order priority the exchange notes that it is not proposing to amend how complex orders are allocated or the priority afforded to complex orders in open outcry it is merely modifying the requirements for a complex order to be eligible for the existing open outcry complex order priority the exchange notes that tphs may continue to represent and execute in open outcry a complex order with any number of legs and in any ratio however if a complex order does not satisfy the applicable ratio requirements as set forth above then it will not be eligible for the complex order benefits listed in table  additionally even if a complex order is fully hedged market participants do not have to utilize the complex order benefits listed in table  if they choose not to the exchange believes the proposed changes will increase opportunities for execution of complex orders and lead to tighter spreads on cboe which will benefit investors the exchange also believes that the proposed rule change is designed to not permit unfair discrimination among market participants as all market participants may trade complex orders and the priority eligibility requirements apply to complex orders of all market participants b selfregulatory organization’s statement on burden on competition the exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act the exchange believes that simplifying and  see id verdate sep  mar   jkt  expanding its rules related to complex orders helps provide clarity with regards to the execution of complex orders and increases the likelihood that market participants will execute bonafide complex orders on cboe this proposal promotes fair and orderly markets as well as assists the exchange in its ability to effectively attract order flow and liquidity to its market which ultimately benefits all tphs and all investors complex orders are available to all tphs and all nontph market participants through tphs and the exchange believes any perceived burden on customers is outweighed by customers’ ability to execute complex orders as proposed c selfregulatory organization’s statement on comments on the proposed rule change received from members participants or others the exchange neither solicited nor received comments on the proposed rule change iii date of effectiveness of the proposed rule change and timing for commission action within  days of the date of publication of this notice in the federal register or within such longer period up to  days i as the commission may designate if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or ii as to which the exchange consents the commission will a by order approve or disapprove such proposed rule change or b institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved iv solicitation of comments
