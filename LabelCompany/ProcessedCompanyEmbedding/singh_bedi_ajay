spinoff earlier this week rupert murdochcontrolled news corp rejigged its top brass as it announced plans to split the company into two one to look after its publishing portfolio and the other for the media and entertainment unit the split has largely been driven by financial considerations investors had been making a case for it for a long time now as the publishing arm which has newspapers such as the wall street journal the times london and the new york times accounts for less than  per cent of the operating profits for the group the rest of the profits come from the company’s entertainment

readers and viewers around the world and relentlessly drive global growth by promoting excellence and investing in our businesses” the challenges facing murdoch’s media industry are immense in
