the origins of socially responsible investing may date back to the religious society of friends quakers in  the quaker philadelphia yearly meeting prohibited members from participating in the slave trade – buying or selling humans one of the most articulate early adopters of sri was john wesley – one of the founders of methodism wesleys sermon the use of money outlined his basic tenets of social investing – ie not to harm your neighbor through your business practices and to avoid industries like tanning and chemical production which can harm the health of workers some of the bestknown applications of socially responsible investing were religiously motivated investors would avoid “sinful” companies such as those associated with products such as guns liquor and tobacco the modern era of socially responsible investing evolved during the political climate of the s during this time socially concerned investors increasingly sought to address equality for women civil rights and labor issues economic development projects started or managed by dr martin luther king like the montgomery bus boycott and the operation breadbasket project in chicago established the beginning model for socially responsible investing efforts king combined ongoing dialog with boycotts and direct action targeting specific corporations concerns about the vietnam war were incorporated by some social investors many people living during the era remember a picture in june  of a naked nineyearold girl phan thị kim phúc running towards a photographer screaming her back burning from the napalm dropped on her village that photograph channeled outrage against dow chemical the manufacturer of napalm and prompted protests across the country against dow chemical and other companies profiting from the vietnam war during the s and s trade unions deployed multiemployer pension fund monies for targeted investments for example the united mine workers fund invested in medical facilities and the international ladies garment workers union ilgwu and international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew financed unionbuilt housing projects labor unions also sought to leverage pension stocks for shareholder activism on proxy fights and shareholder resolutions in  sri efforts by pension funds was spurred by the north will rise again pensions politics and power in the s and the subsequent organizing efforts of authors jeremy rifkin and randy barber by  presidential candidates jimmy carter ronald reagan and jerry brown advocated some type of social orientation for pension investments sri had an important role in ending the apartheid government in south africa international opposition to apartheid strengthened after the  sharpeville massacre in  reverend leon sullivan at the time a board member for general motors drafted a code of conduct for practicing business in south africa which became known as the sullivan principles however reports documenting the application of the sullivan principles said that us companies were not trying to lessen discrimination in south africa due to these reports and mounting political pressure cities states colleges faithbased groups and pension funds throughout the us began divesting from companies operating in south africa in  the united nations imposed a mandatory arms embargo against south africa from the s to the early s large institutions avoided investment in south africa under apartheid the subsequent negative flow of investment eventually forced a group of businesses representing  of south african employers to draft a charter calling for an end to apartheid while the sri efforts alone did not bring an end to apartheid it did focus persuasive international pressure on the south african business community the mid and late s saw the rise of sri’s focus on a diverse range of other issues including tobacco stocks mutual fund proxy disclosure and other diverse focuses since the late s sri has become increasingly defined as a means to promote environmentally sustainable development many investors consider effects of global climate change a significant business and investment risk ceres was founded in  by joan bavaria and dennis hayes coordinator of the first earth day as a network for investors environmental organizations and other public interest groups interested in working with companies to address environmental concerns since  representatives from the sri industry have gathered at the annual sri in the rockies conference to exchange ideas and gain momentum for new initiatives this conference is produced by first affirmative financial network an investment advisory firm that specializes in sustainable and responsible investing the conference has attracted over  persons annually since  the first sellside brokerage in the world to offer sri research was the brazilian bank unibanco the service was launched in january  by unibanco sri analyst christopher wells from the são paulo headquarters of the bank it was targeted at sri funds in europe and the us although it was sent to nonsri funds both in and out of brazil the research was about environmental and social issues but not governance issues regarding companies listed in brazil it was sent for free to unibancos clients the service lasted until mid two good things came out this research the idea was picked up by mike tyrrell who worked at jupiter an sri fund manager in london and who developed it into something much bigger and better at hsbc and then citigroup abn amros operation in brazil used this research to create the first sri fund in an emerging market launched in november  as of late  this fund called fundo ethical was the brazilian operations biggest and best performing stock fund of any kind abn amros operation in brazil was bought by santander in  drawing on the industrys experience using divestment as a tool against apartheid the sudan divestment task force was established in  in response to the genocide occurring in the darfur region of the sudan support from the us government followed with the sudan accountability and divestment act of  more recently some social investors have sought to address the rights of indigenous peoples around the world who are affected by the business practices of various companies the  sri in the rockies conference held a special preconference specifically to address the concerns of indigenous peoples healthy working conditions fair wages product safety and equal opportunity employment also remain headline concerns for many social investors in the mids some funds developed gender lens investing strategies to promote workplace equity and general welfare of women and girls current strategiesedit socially responsible investing is a growing market in both the us and europe in particular it has become an important principle guiding the investment strategies of various funds and accounts governmentcontrolled fundsedit governmentcontrolled funds such as pension funds are often very large players in the investment field and are being pressured by the citizenry and by activist groups to adopt investment policies which encourage ethical corporate behavior respect the rights of workers consider environmental concerns and avoid violations of human rights one outstanding endorsement of such policies is the government pension fund of norway which is mandated to avoid investments which constitute an unacceptable risk that the fund may contribute to unethical acts or omissions such as violations of fundamental humanitarian principles serious violations of human rights gross corruption or severe environmental damages many pension funds are currently under pressure to disinvest from the arms company bae systems partially due to a campaign run by the campaign against arms trade caat liverpool city council has passed a successful resolution to disinvest from the company but a similar attempt by the scottish green party in edinburgh city council was blocked by the liberal democrats mutual funds and etfsedit socially responsible mutual funds counted by the  trends report increased in number to  in  up from  in   in

factors into investment analysis where a separate account is subject to erisa there are legal limitations on the extent to which investment decisions can be based on factors other than maximizing plan participants economic returns shareholder advocacyedit shareholder resolutions are filed by a wide variety of institutional investors including public pension funds faithbased investors socially responsible mutual funds and labor unions in  faithbased organizations filed  resolutions while socially responsible funds filed  resolutions regulations governing shareholder resolutions vary from country to country in the united states they are determined primarily by the securities and exchange commission which regulates mutual funds and applies the  act and by the department of labor which regulates certain plans and applies erisa these regulatory regimes require pension plans and mutual funds to disclose how they voted on behalf of their investors us shareholders have organized various groups to facilitate jointly filing resolutions these include the council of institutional investors the interfaith center on corporate responsibility and the us sif from  to  more than  us institutions and investment management firms filed or cofiled proposals these institutions and money managers collectively controlled  trillion in assets at the end of  the top categories of environmental and social issues from  to  were political contributions and climate change and environmental issues community investingedit community investing a subset of socially responsible investing allows for investment directly into communitybased organizations community investing institutions use investor capital to finance or guarantee loans to individuals and organizations that have historically been denied access to capital by traditional financial institutions these loans are used for housing small business creation and education or personal development in the us or are made available to local financial institutions abroad to finance international community development the community investing institution typically provides training and other types of support and expertise to ensure the success of the loan and its returns for investors community investing grew almost  from  to  assets held and invested locally by community development financial institutions cdfis based in the us totaled  billion at the start of  up from  billion in  investing strategiesedit investing in capital marketsedit social investors use several strategies to maximize financial return and attempt to maximize social good these strategies seek to create change by shifting the cost of capital down for sustainable firm and up for the nonsustainable ones the proponents argue that access to capital is what drives the future direction of development negative screeningedit negative screening excludes certain securities from investment consideration based on social or environmental criteria for example many socially responsible investors screen out tobacco company investments the longestrunning sri index the domini —now the msci kld —was started in may  it has continued to perform competitively —with average annualized total returns of  through december  compared with  for the sp  despite this impressive growth it has long been commonly perceived that sri brings smaller returns than unrestricted investing socalled sin stocks including purveyors of tobacco alcohol gambling and defense contractors were banned from portfolios on moral or ethical grounds and shutting out entire industries hurts performance the critics said however in a comprehensive study financial economists lobe roithmeier and walkshäusl taking the position of the advocatus diaboli answer the question whether to invest in a socially responsible way – or not they create a set of global and domestic sin indexes consisting of  publicly traded socially irresponsible stocks around the world belonging to the sextet of sin adult entertainment alcohol gambling nuclear power tobacco and weapons they compare their stock market performance directly with a set of virtue comparables consisting of the most important international socially responsible investment indexes they find no compelling evidence that ethical and unethical screens lead to a significant difference in their financial performance which is in contrast with the results of prior studies on sinful investing divestmentedit divesting is the act of removing stocks from a portfolio based on mainly ethical nonfinancial objections to certain business activities of a corporation recently calstrs california state teachers retirement system announced the removal of more than  million in tobacco holdings from its investment portfolio after  months of financial analysis and deliberations shareholder activismedit shareholder activism efforts attempt to positively influence corporate behavior these efforts include initiating conversations with corporate management on issues of concern and submitting and voting proxy resolutions these activities are undertaken with the belief that social investors working cooperatively can steer management on a course that will improve financial performance over time and enhance the well being of the stockholders customers employees vendors and communities recent movements have also been reported of investor relations activism in which investor relations firms assist groups of shareholder activists in an organized push for change within a corporation this is done typically by leveraging their enhanced knowledge of the corporation its management often via direct relationships and the securities laws as a whole hedge funds are also major activist investors while some pursue socially responsible investing goals many simply are seeking to maximize fund returns pension plans subject to erisa are somewhat more constrained in their ability to engage in shareholder activism or the use of plan assets to promote public policy positions any expenditure of plan assets must be aimed at enhancing participants retirement income shareholder engagementedit a less vocal subtype of shareholder activism shareholder engagement requires extensive monitoring of the nonfinancial performance of all portfolio companies in shareholder engagement dialogues investees receive constructive feedback on how to improve esg issues within their sphere of influence positive investingedit positive investing is the new generation of socially responsible investing it involves making investments in activities and companies believed to have a positive social impact positive investing suggested a broad revamping of the industrys methodology for driving change through investments this investment approach allows investors to positively express their values on corporate behavior issues such as social justice and the environment through stock selection – without sacrificing portfolio diversification or longterm performance positive screening pushes the idea of sustainability not just in the narrow environmental or humanitarian sense but also in the sense of a companys longterm potential to compete and succeed in  morgan stanley conducted a review of  funds and concluded strong sustainability investments outperformed weak sustainability investments tackling the idea of a tradeoff between positive impact and financial return while the global impact investing networks  report on benchmarks and returns in impact investing in private equity and venture capital found marketrate or marketbeating returns were common in impact investments impact investingedit impact investing is the alternative investment ie private equity approach to positive investing in  the uks presidency of the g created a social impact investment task force which produced a series of reports that defined impact investing as those that intentionally target specific social objectives along with a financial return and measure the achievement of both impact investing capitalizes businesses that potentially provide social or environmental impact at a scale that purely philanthropic interventions usually cannot reach this capital may be in a range of forms including private equity debt working capital lines of credit and loan guarantees examples in recent decades include many investments in microfinance community development finance and clean technology impacting investing has its roots in the venture capital community and an investor will often take active role mentoring or leading the growth of the company or startup community investmentedit by investing directly in an institution rather than purchasing stock an investor is able to create a greater social impact money spent purchasing stock accrues to the stocks previous owner and may not generate social good while money invested in a community institution is put to work for example money invested in a community development financial institution may be used by that institution to alleviate poverty or inequality spread access to capital to underserved communities support economic development or green business or create other social good in  trillium asset managements founder joan bavaria invited chuck matthei of the institute for community economics ice an organization that helps communities create and sustain land trusts to a meeting of us sif it is likely that this was the first time a nonprofit organization with a loan fund

funds have launched offering a wide range of investment criteria both negatively screened and with positive investment criteria ie investing into companies involved in promoting sustainability since  most of the major investment organizations have launched ethical and socially responsible funds although this has led to a great deal of discussion and debate over the use of the term ethical investment this is because each of the fund management organizations tend to apply a slightly different approach to running their funds in recent years there has been growth in the market for high social impact investments this is a style of investing where the businesses receiving investment have social or environmental goals as a primary purposecitation needed uk institutions are also getting more involved in social investing through impact investing funds with those such as deutsche bank and nesta alongside other institutions such as big issue invest which is part of the big issue group

friends quakers in  the quaker philadelphia yearly meeting prohibited members from participating in the slave trade – buying or selling humans one of the most articulate early adopters of sri was john wesley – one of the founders of methodism wesleys sermon the use of money outlined his basic tenets of social investing – ie not to harm your neighbor through your business practices and to avoid industries like tanning and chemical production which can harm the health of workers some of the bestknown applications of socially responsible investing were religiously motivated investors would avoid “sinful” companies such as those associated with products such as guns liquor and tobacco the modern era of socially responsible investing evolved during the political climate of the s during this time socially concerned investors increasingly sought to address equality for women civil rights and labor issues economic development projects started or managed by dr martin luther king like the montgomery bus boycott and the operation breadbasket project in chicago established the beginning model for socially responsible investing efforts king combined ongoing dialog with boycotts and direct action targeting specific corporations concerns about the vietnam war were incorporated by some social investors many people living during the era remember a picture in june  of a naked nineyearold girl phan thị kim phúc running towards a photographer screaming her back burning from the napalm dropped on her village that photograph channeled outrage against dow chemical the manufacturer of napalm and prompted protests across the country against dow chemical and other companies profiting from the vietnam war during the s and s trade unions deployed multiemployer pension fund monies for targeted investments for example the united mine workers fund invested in medical facilities and the international ladies garment workers union ilgwu and international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew financed unionbuilt housing projects labor unions also sought to leverage pension stocks for shareholder activism on proxy fights and shareholder resolutions in  sri efforts by pension funds was spurred by the north will rise again pensions politics and power in the s and the subsequent organizing efforts of authors jeremy rifkin and randy barber by  presidential candidates jimmy carter ronald reagan and jerry brown advocated some type of social orientation for pension investments sri had an important role in ending the apartheid government in south africa international opposition to apartheid strengthened after the  sharpeville massacre in  reverend leon sullivan at the time a board member for general motors drafted a code of conduct for practicing business in south africa which became known as the sullivan principles however reports documenting the application of the sullivan principles said that us companies were not trying to lessen discrimination in south africa due to these reports and mounting political pressure cities states colleges faithbased groups and pension funds throughout the us began divesting from companies operating in south africa in  the united nations imposed a mandatory arms embargo against south africa from the s to the early s large institutions avoided investment in south africa under apartheid the subsequent negative flow of investment eventually forced a group of businesses representing  of south african employers to draft a charter calling for an end to apartheid while the sri efforts alone did not bring an end to apartheid it did focus persuasive international pressure on the south african business community the mid and late s saw the rise of sri’s focus on a diverse range of other issues including tobacco stocks mutual fund proxy disclosure and other diverse focuses since the late s sri has become increasingly defined as a means to promote environmentally sustainable development many investors consider effects of global climate change a significant business and investment risk ceres was founded in  by joan bavaria and dennis hayes coordinator of the first earth day as a network for investors environmental organizations and other public interest groups interested in working with companies to address environmental concerns since  representatives from the sri industry have gathered at the annual sri in the rockies conference to exchange ideas and gain momentum for new initiatives this conference is produced by first affirmative financial network an investment advisory firm that specializes in sustainable and responsible investing the conference has attracted over  persons annually since  the first sellside brokerage in the world to offer sri research was the brazilian bank unibanco the service was launched in january  by unibanco sri analyst christopher wells from the são paulo headquarters of the bank it was targeted at sri funds in europe and the us although it was sent to nonsri funds both in and out of brazil the research was about environmental and social issues but not governance issues regarding companies listed in brazil it was sent for free to unibancos clients the service lasted until mid two good things came out this research the idea was picked up by mike tyrrell who worked at jupiter an sri fund manager in london and who developed it into something much bigger and better at hsbc and then citigroup abn amros operation in brazil used this research to create the first sri fund in an emerging market launched in november  as of late  this fund called fundo ethical was the brazilian operations biggest and best performing stock fund of any kind abn amros operation in brazil was bought by santander in  drawing on the industrys experience using divestment as a tool against apartheid the sudan divestment task force was established in  in response to the genocide occurring in the darfur region of the sudan support from the us government followed with the sudan accountability and divestment act of  more recently some social investors have sought to address the rights of indigenous peoples around the world who are affected by the business practices of various companies the  sri in the rockies conference held a special preconference specifically to address the concerns of indigenous peoples healthy working conditions fair wages product safety and equal opportunity employment also remain headline concerns for many social investors in the mids some funds developed gender lens investing strategies to promote workplace equity and general welfare of women and girls current strategiesedit socially responsible investing is a growing market in both the us and europe in particular it has become an important principle guiding the investment strategies of various funds and accounts governmentcontrolled fundsedit governmentcontrolled funds such as pension funds are often very large players in the investment field and are being pressured by the citizenry and by activist groups to adopt investment policies which encourage ethical corporate behavior respect the rights of workers consider environmental concerns and avoid violations of human rights one outstanding endorsement of such policies is the government pension fund of norway which is mandated to avoid investments which constitute an unacceptable risk that the fund may contribute to unethical acts or omissions such as violations of fundamental humanitarian principles serious violations of human rights gross corruption or severe environmental damages many pension funds are currently under pressure to disinvest from the arms company bae systems partially due to a campaign run by the campaign against arms trade caat liverpool city council has passed a successful resolution to disinvest from the company but a similar attempt by the scottish green party in edinburgh city council was blocked by the liberal democrats mutual funds and etfsedit socially responsible mutual funds counted by the  trends report increased in number to  in  up from  in   in   in     in  and  in  the overall number of mutual funds incorporating environmental social and

trends among separate account managers  distinctive separate account vehicles or strategies with  billion in assets incorporated esg factors into investment analysis where a separate account is subject to erisa there are legal limitations on the extent to which investment decisions can be based on factors other than maximizing plan participants economic returns shareholder advocacyedit shareholder resolutions are filed by a wide variety of institutional investors including public pension funds faithbased investors socially responsible mutual funds and labor unions in  faithbased organizations filed  resolutions while socially responsible funds filed  resolutions regulations governing shareholder resolutions vary from country to country in the united states they are determined primarily by the securities and exchange commission which regulates mutual funds and applies the  act and by the department of labor which regulates certain plans and applies erisa these regulatory regimes require pension plans and mutual funds to disclose how they voted on behalf of their investors us shareholders have organized various groups to facilitate jointly filing resolutions these include the council of institutional investors the interfaith center on corporate responsibility and the us sif from  to  more than  us institutions and investment management firms filed or cofiled proposals these institutions and money managers collectively controlled  trillion in assets at the end of  the top categories of environmental and social issues from  to  were political contributions and climate change and environmental issues community investingedit community investing a subset of socially responsible investing allows for investment directly into communitybased organizations community investing institutions use investor capital to finance or guarantee loans to individuals and organizations that have historically been denied access to capital by traditional financial institutions these loans are used for housing small business creation and education or personal development in the us or are made available to local financial institutions abroad to finance international community development the community investing institution typically provides training and other types of support and expertise to ensure the success of the loan and its returns for investors community investing grew almost  from  to  assets held and invested locally by community development financial institutions cdfis based in the us totaled  billion at the start of  up from  billion in  investing strategiesedit investing in capital marketsedit social investors use several strategies to maximize financial return and attempt to maximize social good these strategies seek to create change by shifting the cost of capital down for sustainable firm and up for the nonsustainable ones the proponents argue that access to capital is what drives the future direction of development negative screeningedit negative screening excludes certain securities from investment consideration based on social or environmental criteria for example many socially responsible investors screen out tobacco company investments the longestrunning sri index the domini —now the msci kld —was started in may  it has continued to perform competitively —with average annualized total returns of  through december  compared with  for the sp  despite this impressive growth it has long been commonly perceived that sri brings smaller returns than unrestricted investing socalled sin stocks including purveyors of tobacco alcohol gambling and defense contractors were banned from portfolios on moral or ethical grounds and shutting out entire industries hurts performance the critics said however in a comprehensive study financial economists lobe roithmeier and walkshäusl taking the position of the advocatus diaboli answer the question whether to invest in a socially responsible way – or not they create a set of global and domestic sin indexes consisting of  publicly traded socially irresponsible stocks around the world belonging to the sextet of sin adult entertainment alcohol gambling nuclear power tobacco and weapons they compare their stock market performance directly with a set of virtue comparables consisting of the most important international socially responsible investment indexes they find no compelling evidence that ethical and unethical screens lead to a significant difference in their financial performance which is in contrast with the results of prior studies on sinful investing divestmentedit divesting is the act of removing stocks from a portfolio based on mainly ethical nonfinancial objections to certain business activities of a corporation recently calstrs california state teachers retirement system announced the removal of more than  million in tobacco holdings from its investment portfolio after  months of financial analysis and deliberations shareholder activismedit shareholder activism efforts attempt to positively influence corporate behavior these efforts include initiating conversations with corporate management on issues of concern and submitting and voting proxy resolutions these activities are undertaken with the belief that social investors working cooperatively can steer management on a course that will improve financial performance over time and enhance the well being of the stockholders customers employees vendors and communities recent movements have also been reported of investor relations activism in which investor relations firms assist groups of shareholder activists in an organized push for change within a corporation this is done typically by leveraging their enhanced knowledge of the corporation its management often via direct relationships and the securities laws as a whole hedge funds are also major activist investors while some pursue socially responsible investing goals many simply are seeking to maximize fund returns pension plans subject to erisa are somewhat more constrained in their ability to engage in shareholder activism or the use of plan assets to promote public policy positions any expenditure of plan assets must be aimed at enhancing participants retirement income shareholder engagementedit a less vocal subtype of shareholder activism shareholder engagement requires extensive monitoring of the nonfinancial performance of all portfolio companies in shareholder engagement dialogues investees receive constructive feedback on how to improve esg issues within their sphere of influence positive investingedit positive investing is the new generation of socially responsible investing it involves making investments in activities and companies believed to have a positive social impact positive investing suggested a broad revamping of the industrys methodology for driving change through investments this investment approach allows investors to positively express their values on corporate behavior issues such as social justice and the environment through stock selection – without sacrificing portfolio diversification or longterm performance positive screening pushes the idea of sustainability not just in the narrow environmental or humanitarian sense but also in the sense of a companys longterm potential to compete and succeed in  morgan stanley conducted a review of  funds and concluded strong sustainability investments outperformed weak sustainability investments tackling the idea of a tradeoff between positive impact and financial return while the global impact investing networks  report on benchmarks and returns in impact investing in private equity and venture capital found marketrate or marketbeating returns were common in impact investments impact investingedit impact investing is the alternative investment ie private equity approach to positive investing in  the uks presidency of the g created a social impact investment task force which produced a series of reports that defined impact investing as those that intentionally target specific social objectives along with a financial return and measure the achievement of both impact investing capitalizes businesses that potentially provide social or environmental impact at a scale that purely philanthropic interventions usually cannot reach this capital may be in a range of forms including private equity debt working capital lines of credit and loan guarantees examples in recent decades include many investments in microfinance community development finance and clean technology impacting investing has its roots in the venture capital community and an investor will often take active role mentoring or leading the growth of the company or startup community investmentedit by investing directly in an institution rather than purchasing stock an investor is able to create a greater social impact money spent purchasing stock accrues to the stocks previous owner and may not generate social good while money invested in a community institution is put to work for example money invested in a community development financial institution may be used by that institution to alleviate poverty or inequality spread access to capital to underserved communities support economic development or green business or create other social good in  trillium asset managements founder joan bavaria invited chuck matthei of the institute for community economics ice an organization that helps communities create and sustain land trusts to a meeting of us sif it is likely that this was the first time a nonprofit organization with a loan fund would meet directly with sri managers trillium clients began investing in ice later that year global contextedit socially responsible investing is a global phenomenon with the international scope of business itself social investors frequently invest in companies with international operations as international investment products and opportunities have expanded so have international sri products the ranks of social investors are growing throughout developed and developing countries in  the united nations environment programme launched its principles for responsible investment which provide a framework for investors to incorporate environmental

the first ethically screened investment fund with criteria which excluded tobacco arms alcohol and oppressive regimes since  over  investment funds have launched offering a wide range of investment criteria both negatively screened and with positive investment criteria ie investing into companies involved in promoting sustainability since  most of the major investment organizations have launched ethical and socially responsible funds although this has led to a great deal of discussion and debate over the use of the term ethical investment this is because each of the fund management organizations tend to apply a slightly different approach to running their funds in recent years there has been growth in the market for high social impact investments this is a style of investing where the businesses receiving investment have social or environmental goals as a primary purposecitation needed uk institutions are also getting more involved in social investing through impact investing funds with those such as deutsche bank and nesta alongside other institutions such as big issue invest which is part of the big issue group as of june  eiris estimated that there was over £

the origins of socially responsible investing may date back to the religious society of friends quakers in  the quaker philadelphia yearly meeting prohibited members from participating in the slave trade – buying or selling humans one of the most articulate early adopters of sri was john wesley – one of the founders of methodism wesleys sermon the use of money outlined his basic tenets of social investing – ie not to harm your neighbor through your business practices and to avoid industries like tanning and chemical production which can harm the health of workers some of the bestknown applications of socially responsible investing were religiously motivated investors would avoid “sinful” companies such as those associated with products such as guns liquor and tobacco the modern era of socially responsible investing evolved during the political climate of the s during this time socially concerned investors increasingly sought to address equality for women civil rights and labor issues economic development projects started or managed by dr martin luther king like the montgomery bus boycott and the operation breadbasket project in chicago established the beginning model for socially responsible investing efforts king combined ongoing dialog with boycotts and direct action targeting specific corporations concerns about the vietnam war were incorporated by some social investors many people living during the era remember a picture in june  of a naked nineyearold girl phan thị kim phúc running towards a photographer screaming her back burning from the napalm dropped on her village that photograph channeled outrage against dow chemical the manufacturer of napalm and prompted protests across the country against dow chemical and other companies profiting from the vietnam war during the s and s trade unions deployed multiemployer pension fund monies for targeted investments for example the united mine workers fund invested in medical facilities and the international ladies garment workers union ilgwu and international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew financed unionbuilt housing projects labor unions also sought to leverage pension stocks for shareholder activism on proxy fights and shareholder resolutions in  sri efforts by pension funds was spurred by the north will rise again pensions politics and power in the s and the subsequent organizing efforts of authors jeremy rifkin and randy barber by  presidential candidates jimmy carter ronald reagan and jerry brown advocated some type of social orientation for pension investments sri had an important role in ending the apartheid government in south africa international opposition to apartheid strengthened after the  sharpeville massacre in  reverend leon sullivan at the time a board member for general motors drafted a code of conduct for practicing business in south africa which became known as the sullivan principles however reports documenting the application of the sullivan principles said that us companies were not trying to lessen discrimination in south africa due to these reports and mounting political pressure cities states colleges faithbased groups and pension funds throughout the us began divesting from companies operating in south africa in  the united nations imposed a mandatory arms embargo against south africa from the s to the early s large institutions avoided investment in south africa under apartheid the subsequent negative flow of investment eventually forced a group of businesses representing  of south african employers to draft a charter calling for an end to apartheid while the sri efforts alone did not bring an end to apartheid it did focus persuasive international pressure on the south african business community the mid and late s saw the rise of sri’s focus on a diverse range of other issues including tobacco stocks mutual fund proxy disclosure and other diverse focuses since the late s sri has become increasingly defined as a means to promote environmentally sustainable development many investors consider effects of global climate change a significant business and investment risk ceres was founded in  by joan bavaria and dennis hayes coordinator of the first earth day as a network for investors environmental organizations and other public interest groups interested in working with companies to address environmental concerns since  representatives from the sri industry have gathered at the annual sri in the rockies conference to exchange ideas and gain momentum for new initiatives this conference is produced by first affirmative financial network an investment advisory firm that specializes in sustainable and responsible investing the conference has attracted over  persons annually since  the first sellside brokerage in the world to offer sri research was the brazilian bank unibanco the service was launched in january  by unibanco sri analyst christopher wells from the são paulo headquarters of the bank it was targeted at sri funds in europe and the us although it was sent to nonsri funds both in and out of brazil the research was about environmental and social issues but not governance issues regarding companies listed in brazil it was sent for free to unibancos clients the service lasted until mid two good things came out this research the idea was picked up by mike tyrrell who worked at jupiter an sri fund manager in london and who developed it into something much bigger and better at hsbc and then citigroup abn amros operation in brazil used this research to create the first sri fund in an emerging market launched in november  as of late  this fund called fundo ethical was the brazilian operations biggest and best performing stock fund of any kind abn amros operation in brazil was bought by santander in  drawing on the industrys experience using divestment as a tool against apartheid the sudan divestment task force was established in  in response to the genocide occurring in the darfur region of the sudan support from the us government followed with the sudan accountability and divestment act of  more recently some social investors have sought to address the rights of indigenous peoples around the world who are affected by the business practices of various companies the  sri in the rockies conference held a special preconference specifically to address the concerns of indigenous peoples healthy working conditions fair wages product safety and equal opportunity employment also remain headline concerns for many social investors in the mids some funds developed gender lens investing strategies to promote workplace equity and general welfare of women and girls current strategiesedit socially responsible investing is a growing market in both the us and europe in particular it has become an important principle guiding the investment strategies of various funds and accounts governmentcontrolled fundsedit governmentcontrolled funds such as pension funds are often very large players in the investment field and are being pressured by the citizenry and by activist groups to adopt investment policies which encourage ethical corporate behavior respect the rights of workers consider environmental concerns and avoid violations of human rights one outstanding endorsement of such policies is the government pension fund of norway which is mandated to avoid investments which constitute an unacceptable risk that the fund may contribute to unethical acts or omissions such as violations of fundamental humanitarian principles serious violations of human rights gross corruption or severe environmental damages many pension funds are currently under pressure to disinvest from the arms company bae systems partially due to a campaign run by the campaign against arms trade caat liverpool city council has passed a successful resolution to disinvest from the company but a similar attempt by the scottish green party in edinburgh city council was blocked by the liberal democrats mutual funds and etfsedit socially responsible mutual funds counted by the  trends report increased in number to  in  up from  in   in

factors into investment analysis where a separate account is subject to erisa there are legal limitations on the extent to which investment decisions can be based on factors other than maximizing plan participants economic returns shareholder advocacyedit shareholder resolutions are filed by a wide variety of institutional investors including public pension funds faithbased investors socially responsible mutual funds and labor unions in  faithbased organizations filed  resolutions while socially responsible funds filed  resolutions regulations governing shareholder resolutions vary from country to country in the united states they are determined primarily by the securities and exchange commission which regulates mutual funds and applies the  act and by the department of labor which regulates certain plans and applies erisa these regulatory regimes require pension plans and mutual funds to disclose how they voted on behalf of their investors us shareholders have organized various groups to facilitate jointly filing resolutions these include the council of institutional investors the interfaith center on corporate responsibility and the us sif from  to  more than  us institutions and investment management firms filed or cofiled proposals these institutions and money managers collectively controlled  trillion in assets at the end of  the top categories of environmental and social issues from  to  were political contributions and climate change and environmental issues community investingedit community investing a subset of socially responsible investing allows for investment directly into communitybased organizations community investing institutions use investor capital to finance or guarantee loans to individuals and organizations that have historically been denied access to capital by traditional financial institutions these loans are used for housing small business creation and education or personal development in the us or are made available to local financial institutions abroad to finance international community development the community investing institution typically provides training and other types of support and expertise to ensure the success of the loan and its returns for investors community investing grew almost  from  to  assets held and invested locally by community development financial institutions cdfis based in the us totaled  billion at the start of  up from  billion in  investing strategiesedit investing in capital marketsedit social investors use several strategies to maximize financial return and attempt to maximize social good these strategies seek to create change by shifting the cost of capital down for sustainable firm and up for the nonsustainable ones the proponents argue that access to capital is what drives the future direction of development negative screeningedit negative screening excludes certain securities from investment consideration based on social or environmental criteria for example many socially responsible investors screen out tobacco company investments the longestrunning sri index the domini —now the msci kld —was started in may  it has continued to perform competitively —with average annualized total returns of  through december  compared with  for the sp  despite this impressive growth it has long been commonly perceived that sri brings smaller returns than unrestricted investing socalled sin stocks including purveyors of tobacco alcohol gambling and defense contractors were banned from portfolios on moral or ethical grounds and shutting out entire industries hurts performance the critics said however in a comprehensive study financial economists lobe roithmeier and walkshäusl taking the position of the advocatus diaboli answer the question whether to invest in a socially responsible way – or not they create a set of global and domestic sin indexes consisting of  publicly traded socially irresponsible stocks around the world belonging to the sextet of sin adult entertainment alcohol gambling nuclear power tobacco and weapons they compare their stock market performance directly with a set of virtue comparables consisting of the most important international socially responsible investment indexes they find no compelling evidence that ethical and unethical screens lead to a significant difference in their financial performance which is in contrast with the results of prior studies on sinful investing divestmentedit divesting is the act of removing stocks from a portfolio based on mainly ethical nonfinancial objections to certain business activities of a corporation recently calstrs california state teachers retirement system announced the removal of more than  million in tobacco holdings from its investment portfolio after  months of financial analysis and deliberations shareholder activismedit shareholder activism efforts attempt to positively influence corporate behavior these efforts include initiating conversations with corporate management on issues of concern and submitting and voting proxy resolutions these activities are undertaken with the belief that social investors working cooperatively can steer management on a course that will improve financial performance over time and enhance the well being of the stockholders customers employees vendors and communities recent movements have also been reported of investor relations activism in which investor relations firms assist groups of shareholder activists in an organized push for change within a corporation this is done typically by leveraging their enhanced knowledge of the corporation its management often via direct relationships and the securities laws as a whole hedge funds are also major activist investors while some pursue socially responsible investing goals many simply are seeking to maximize fund returns pension plans subject to erisa are somewhat more constrained in their ability to engage in shareholder activism or the use of plan assets to promote public policy positions any expenditure of plan assets must be aimed at enhancing participants retirement income shareholder engagementedit a less vocal subtype of shareholder activism shareholder engagement requires extensive monitoring of the nonfinancial performance of all portfolio companies in shareholder engagement dialogues investees receive constructive feedback on how to improve esg issues within their sphere of influence positive investingedit positive investing is the new generation of socially responsible investing it involves making investments in activities and companies believed to have a positive social impact positive investing suggested a broad revamping of the industrys methodology for driving change through investments this investment approach allows investors to positively express their values on corporate behavior issues such as social justice and the environment through stock selection – without sacrificing portfolio diversification or longterm performance positive screening pushes the idea of sustainability not just in the narrow environmental or humanitarian sense but also in the sense of a companys longterm potential to compete and succeed in  morgan stanley conducted a review of  funds and concluded strong sustainability investments outperformed weak sustainability investments tackling the idea of a tradeoff between positive impact and financial return while the global impact investing networks  report on benchmarks and returns in impact investing in private equity and venture capital found marketrate or marketbeating returns were common in impact investments impact investingedit impact investing is the alternative investment ie private equity approach to positive investing in  the uks presidency of the g created a social impact investment task force which produced a series of reports that defined impact investing as those that intentionally target specific social objectives along with a financial return and measure the achievement of both impact investing capitalizes businesses that potentially provide social or environmental impact at a scale that purely philanthropic interventions usually cannot reach this capital may be in a range of forms including private equity debt working capital lines of credit and loan guarantees examples in recent decades include many investments in microfinance community development finance and clean technology impacting investing has its roots in the venture capital community and an investor will often take active role mentoring or leading the growth of the company or startup community investmentedit by investing directly in an institution rather than purchasing stock an investor is able to create a greater social impact money spent purchasing stock accrues to the stocks previous owner and may not generate social good while money invested in a community institution is put to work for example money invested in a community development financial institution may be used by that institution to alleviate poverty or inequality spread access to capital to underserved communities support economic development or green business or create other social good in  trillium asset managements founder joan bavaria invited chuck matthei of the institute for

funds have launched offering a wide range of investment criteria both negatively screened and with positive investment criteria ie investing into companies involved in promoting sustainability since  most of the major investment organizations have launched ethical and socially responsible funds although this has led to a great deal of discussion and debate over the use of the term ethical investment this is because each of the fund management organizations tend to apply a slightly different approach to running their funds in recent years there has been growth in the market for high social impact investments this is a style of investing where the businesses receiving investment have social or environmental goals as a primary purposecitation needed uk institutions are also getting more involved in social investing through impact investing funds with those such as deutsche bank and nesta alongside other institutions such as big issue invest which is part of the big issue group

friends quakers in  the quaker philadelphia yearly meeting prohibited members from participating in the slave trade – buying or selling humans one of the most articulate early adopters of sri was john wesley – one of the founders of methodism wesleys sermon the use of money outlined his basic tenets of social investing – ie not to harm your neighbor through your business practices and to avoid industries like tanning and chemical production which can harm the health of workers some of the bestknown applications of socially responsible investing were religiously motivated investors would avoid “sinful” companies such as those associated with products such as guns liquor and tobacco the modern era of socially responsible investing evolved during the political climate of the s during this time socially concerned investors increasingly sought to address equality for women civil rights and labor issues economic development projects started or managed by dr martin luther king like the montgomery bus boycott and the operation breadbasket project in chicago established the beginning model for socially responsible investing efforts king combined ongoing dialog with boycotts and direct action targeting specific corporations concerns about the vietnam war were incorporated by some social investors many people living during the era remember a picture in june  of a naked nineyearold girl phan thị kim phúc running towards a photographer screaming her back burning from the napalm dropped on her village that photograph channeled outrage against dow chemical the manufacturer of napalm and prompted protests across the country against dow chemical and other companies profiting from the vietnam war during the s and s trade unions deployed multiemployer pension fund monies for targeted investments for example the united mine workers fund invested in medical facilities and the international ladies garment workers union ilgwu and international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew financed unionbuilt housing projects labor unions also sought to leverage pension stocks for shareholder activism on proxy fights and shareholder resolutions in  sri efforts by pension funds was spurred by the north will rise again pensions politics and power in the s and the subsequent organizing efforts of authors jeremy rifkin and randy barber by  presidential candidates jimmy carter ronald reagan and jerry brown advocated some type of social orientation for pension investments sri had an important role in ending the apartheid government in south africa international opposition to apartheid strengthened after the  sharpeville massacre in  reverend leon sullivan at the time a board member for general motors drafted a code of conduct for practicing business in south africa which became known as the sullivan principles however reports documenting the application of the sullivan principles said that us companies were not trying to lessen discrimination in south africa due to these reports and mounting political pressure cities states colleges faithbased groups and pension funds throughout the us began divesting from companies operating in south africa in  the united nations imposed a mandatory arms embargo against south africa from the s to the early s large institutions avoided investment in south africa under apartheid the subsequent negative flow of investment eventually forced a group of businesses representing  of south african employers to draft a charter calling for an end to apartheid while the sri efforts alone did not bring an end to apartheid it did focus persuasive international pressure on the south african business community the mid and late s saw the rise of sri’s focus on a diverse range of other issues including tobacco stocks mutual fund proxy disclosure and other diverse focuses since the late s sri has become increasingly defined as a means to promote environmentally sustainable development many investors consider effects of global climate change a significant business and investment risk ceres was founded in  by joan bavaria and dennis hayes coordinator of the first earth day as a network for investors environmental organizations and other public interest groups interested in working with companies to address environmental concerns since  representatives from the sri industry have gathered at the annual sri in the rockies conference to exchange ideas and gain momentum for new initiatives this conference is produced by first affirmative financial network an investment advisory firm that specializes in sustainable and responsible investing the conference has attracted over  persons annually since  the first sellside brokerage in the world to offer sri research was the brazilian bank unibanco the service was launched in january  by unibanco sri analyst christopher wells from the são paulo headquarters of the bank it was targeted at sri funds in europe and the us although it was sent to nonsri funds both in and out of brazil the research was about environmental and social issues but not governance issues regarding companies listed in brazil it was sent for free to unibancos clients the service lasted until mid two good things came out this research the idea was picked up by mike tyrrell who worked at jupiter an sri fund manager in london and who developed it into something much bigger and better at hsbc and then citigroup abn amros operation in brazil used this research to create the first sri fund in an emerging market launched in november  as of late  this fund called fundo ethical was the brazilian operations biggest and best performing stock fund of any kind abn amros operation in brazil was bought by santander in  drawing on the industrys experience using divestment as a tool against apartheid the sudan divestment task force was established in  in response to the genocide occurring in the darfur region of the sudan support from the us government followed with the sudan accountability and divestment act of  more recently some social investors have sought to address the rights of indigenous peoples around the world who are affected by the business practices of various companies the  sri in the rockies conference held a special preconference specifically to address the concerns of indigenous peoples healthy working conditions fair wages product safety and equal opportunity employment also remain headline concerns for many social investors in the mids some funds developed gender lens investing strategies to promote workplace equity and general welfare of women and girls current strategiesedit socially responsible investing is a growing market in both the us and europe in particular it has become an important principle guiding the investment strategies of various funds and accounts governmentcontrolled fundsedit governmentcontrolled funds such as pension funds are often very large players in the investment field and are being pressured by the citizenry and by activist groups to adopt investment policies which encourage ethical corporate behavior respect the rights of workers consider environmental concerns and avoid violations of human rights one outstanding endorsement of such policies is the government pension fund of norway which is mandated to avoid investments which constitute an unacceptable risk that the fund may contribute to unethical acts or omissions such as violations of fundamental humanitarian principles serious violations of human rights gross corruption or severe environmental damages many pension funds are currently under pressure to disinvest from the arms company bae systems partially due to a campaign run by the campaign against arms trade caat liverpool city council has passed a successful resolution to disinvest from the company but a similar attempt by the scottish green party in edinburgh city council was blocked by the liberal democrats mutual funds and etfsedit socially responsible mutual funds counted by the  trends report increased in number to  in  up from  in   in   in     in  and  in  the overall number of mutual funds incorporating environmental social and

trends among separate account managers  distinctive separate account vehicles or strategies with  billion in assets incorporated esg factors into investment analysis where a separate account is subject to erisa there are legal limitations on the extent to which investment decisions can be based on factors other than maximizing plan participants economic returns shareholder advocacyedit shareholder resolutions are filed by a wide variety of institutional investors including public pension funds faithbased investors socially responsible mutual funds and labor unions in  faithbased organizations filed  resolutions while socially responsible funds filed  resolutions regulations governing shareholder resolutions vary from country to country in the united states they are determined primarily by the securities and exchange commission which regulates mutual funds and applies the  act and by the department of labor which regulates certain plans and applies erisa these regulatory regimes require pension plans and mutual funds to disclose how they voted on behalf of their investors us shareholders have organized various groups to facilitate jointly filing resolutions these include the council of institutional investors the interfaith center on corporate responsibility and the us sif from  to  more than  us institutions and investment management firms filed or cofiled proposals these institutions and money managers collectively controlled  trillion in assets at the end of  the top categories of environmental and social issues from  to  were political contributions and climate change and environmental issues community investingedit community investing a subset of socially responsible investing allows for investment directly into communitybased organizations community investing institutions use investor capital to finance or guarantee loans to individuals and organizations that have historically been denied access to capital by traditional financial institutions these loans are used for housing small business creation and education or personal development in the us or are made available to local financial institutions abroad to finance international community development the community investing institution typically provides training and other types of support and expertise to ensure the success of the loan and its returns for investors community investing grew almost  from  to  assets held and invested locally by community development financial institutions cdfis based in the us totaled  billion at the start of  up from  billion in  investing strategiesedit investing in capital marketsedit social investors use several strategies to maximize financial return and attempt to maximize social good these strategies seek to create change by shifting the cost of capital down for sustainable firm and up for the nonsustainable ones the proponents argue that access to capital is what drives the future direction of development negative screeningedit negative screening excludes certain securities from investment consideration based on social or environmental criteria for example many socially responsible investors screen out tobacco company investments the longestrunning sri index the domini —now the msci kld —was started in may  it has continued to perform competitively —with average annualized total returns of  through december  compared with  for the sp  despite this impressive growth it has long been commonly perceived that sri brings smaller returns than unrestricted investing socalled sin stocks including purveyors of tobacco alcohol gambling and defense contractors were banned from portfolios on moral or ethical grounds and shutting out entire industries hurts performance the critics said however in a comprehensive study financial economists lobe roithmeier and walkshäusl taking the position of the advocatus diaboli answer the question whether to invest in a socially responsible way – or not they create a set of global and domestic sin indexes consisting of  publicly traded socially irresponsible stocks around the world belonging to the sextet of sin adult entertainment alcohol gambling nuclear power tobacco and weapons they compare their stock market performance directly with a set of virtue comparables consisting of the most important international socially responsible investment indexes they find no compelling evidence that ethical and unethical screens lead to a significant difference in their financial performance which is in contrast with the results of prior studies on sinful investing divestmentedit divesting is the act of removing stocks from a portfolio based on mainly ethical nonfinancial objections to certain business activities of a corporation recently calstrs california state teachers retirement system announced the removal of more than  million in tobacco holdings from its investment portfolio after  months of financial analysis and deliberations shareholder activismedit shareholder activism efforts attempt to positively influence corporate behavior these efforts include initiating conversations with corporate management on issues of concern and submitting and voting proxy resolutions these activities are undertaken with the belief that social investors working cooperatively can steer management on a course that will improve financial performance over time and enhance the well being of the stockholders customers employees vendors and communities recent movements have also been reported of investor relations activism in which investor relations firms assist groups of shareholder activists in an organized push for change within a corporation this is done typically by leveraging their enhanced knowledge of the corporation its management often via direct relationships and the securities laws as a whole hedge funds are also major activist investors while some pursue socially responsible investing goals many simply are seeking to maximize fund returns pension plans subject to erisa are somewhat more constrained in their ability to engage in shareholder activism or the use of plan assets to promote public policy positions any expenditure of plan assets must be aimed at enhancing participants retirement income shareholder engagementedit a less vocal subtype of shareholder activism shareholder engagement requires extensive monitoring of the nonfinancial performance of all portfolio companies in shareholder engagement dialogues investees receive constructive feedback on how to improve esg issues within their sphere of influence positive investingedit positive investing is the new generation of socially responsible investing it involves making investments in activities and companies believed to have a positive social impact positive investing suggested a broad revamping of the industrys methodology for driving change through investments this investment approach allows investors to positively express their values on corporate behavior issues such as social justice and the environment through stock selection – without sacrificing portfolio diversification or longterm performance positive screening pushes the idea of sustainability not just in the narrow environmental or humanitarian sense but also in the sense of a companys longterm potential to compete and succeed in  morgan stanley conducted a review of  funds and concluded strong sustainability investments outperformed weak sustainability investments tackling the idea of a tradeoff between positive impact and financial return while the global impact investing networks  report on benchmarks and returns in impact investing in private equity and venture capital found marketrate or marketbeating returns were common in impact investments impact investingedit impact investing is the alternative investment ie private equity approach to positive investing in  the uks presidency of the g created a social impact investment task force which produced a series of reports that defined impact investing as those that intentionally target specific social objectives along with a financial return and measure the achievement of both impact investing capitalizes businesses that potentially provide social or environmental impact at a scale that purely philanthropic interventions usually cannot reach this capital may be in a range of forms including private equity debt working capital lines of credit and loan guarantees examples in recent decades include many investments in microfinance community development finance and clean technology impacting investing has its roots in the venture capital community and an investor will often take active role mentoring or leading the growth of the company or startup community investmentedit by investing directly in an institution rather than purchasing stock an investor is able to create a greater social impact money spent purchasing stock accrues to the stocks previous owner and may not generate social good while money invested in a community institution is put to work for example money invested in a community development financial institution may be used by that institution to alleviate poverty or inequality spread access to capital to underserved communities support economic development or green business or create other social good in  trillium asset managements founder joan bavaria invited chuck matthei of the institute for community economics ice an organization that helps communities create and sustain land trusts to a meeting of us sif it is likely that this was the first time a nonprofit organization with a loan fund would meet directly with sri managers trillium clients began investing in ice later that year global contextedit socially responsible investing is a global phenomenon with the international scope of business itself social investors frequently invest in companies with international operations as international investment products and opportunities have expanded so have international sri products the ranks of social investors are growing throughout developed and developing countries in  the united nations environment programme launched its principles for responsible investment which provide a framework for investors to incorporate environmental

the first ethically screened investment fund with criteria which excluded tobacco arms alcohol and oppressive regimes since  over  investment funds have launched offering a wide range of investment criteria both negatively screened and with positive investment criteria ie investing into companies involved in promoting sustainability since  most of the major investment organizations have launched ethical and socially responsible funds although this has led to a great deal of discussion and debate over the use of the term ethical investment this is because each of the fund management organizations tend to apply a slightly different approach to running their funds in recent years there has been growth in the market for high social impact investments this is a style of investing where the businesses receiving investment have social or environmental goals as a primary purposecitation needed uk institutions are also getting more involved in social investing through impact investing funds with those such as deutsche bank and nesta alongside other institutions such as big issue invest which is part of the big issue group as of june  eiris estimated that there was over £

navigation search it has been suggested that this article be merged with social finance discuss proposed since august  alternative energy one of many forms of sustainable investing socially responsible investing sri or social investment also known as sustainable socially conscious green or ethical investing is any investment strategy which seeks to consider both financial return and social good to bring about a social change recently it has also become known as sustainable investing or responsible investing there is also a subset of sri known as impact investing devoted to the conscious creation of social impact through investment in general socially responsible investors encourage corporate practices that promote environmental stewardship consumer protection human rights and diversity some avoid businesses involved in alcohol tobacco fast food gambling pornography weapons contraceptionabortifacientsabortion fossil fuel production or the military the areas of concern recognized by the sri practitioners are sometimes summarized under the heading of esg issues environment social justice and corporate governance socially responsible investing is one of several related concepts and approaches that influence and in some cases govern how asset managers invest portfolios the term socially responsible investing sometimes narrowly refers to practices that seek to avoid harm by screening companies included in an investment portfolio however the term is also used more broadly to include more proactive practices such as impact investing shareholder advocacy and community investing according to investor amy domini shareholder advocacy and community investing are pillars of socially responsible investing while doing only negative screening is inadequate contents  history  current strategies  governmentcontrolled funds  mutual funds and etfs  separately managed accounts  shareholder advocacy  community investing  investing strategies  investing in capital markets  negative screening  divestment  shareholder activism  shareholder engagement  positive investing  impact investing  community investment  global context  ethical investment in the uk  in higher education  see also  references  external links historyedit the origins of socially responsible investing may date back to the religious society of friends quakers in  the quaker philadelphia yearly meeting prohibited members from participating in the slave trade – buying or selling humans one of the most articulate early adopters of sri was john wesley – one of the founders of methodism wesleys sermon the use of money outlined his basic tenets of social investing – ie not to harm your neighbor through your business practices and to avoid industries like tanning and chemical production which can harm the health of workers some of the bestknown applications of socially responsible investing were religiously motivated investors would avoid “sinful” companies such as those associated with products such as guns liquor and tobacco the modern era of socially responsible investing evolved during the political climate of the s during this time socially concerned investors increasingly sought to address equality for women civil rights and labor issues economic development projects started or managed by dr martin luther king like the montgomery bus boycott and the operation breadbasket project in chicago established the beginning model for socially responsible investing efforts king combined ongoing dialog with boycotts and direct action targeting specific corporations concerns about the vietnam war were incorporated by some social investors many people living during the era remember a picture in june  of a naked nineyearold girl phan thị kim phúc running towards a photographer screaming her back burning from the napalm dropped on her village that photograph channeled outrage against dow chemical the manufacturer of napalm and prompted protests across the country against dow chemical and other companies profiting from the vietnam war during the s and s trade unions deployed multiemployer pension fund monies for targeted investments for example the united mine workers fund invested in medical facilities and the international ladies garment workers union ilgwu and international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew financed unionbuilt housing projects labor unions also sought to leverage pension stocks for shareholder activism on proxy fights and shareholder resolutions in  sri efforts by pension funds was spurred by the north will rise again pensions politics and power in the s and the subsequent organizing efforts of authors jeremy rifkin and randy barber by  presidential candidates jimmy carter ronald reagan and jerry brown advocated some type of social orientation for pension investments sri had an important role in ending the apartheid government in south africa international opposition to apartheid strengthened after the  sharpeville massacre in  reverend leon sullivan at the time a board member for general motors drafted a code of conduct for practicing business in south africa which became known as the sullivan principles however reports documenting the application of the sullivan principles said that us companies were not trying to lessen discrimination in south africa due to these reports and mounting political pressure cities states colleges faithbased groups and pension funds throughout the us began divesting from companies operating in south africa in  the united nations imposed a mandatory arms embargo against south africa from the s to the early s large institutions avoided investment in south africa under apartheid the subsequent negative flow of investment eventually forced a group of businesses representing  of south african employers to draft a charter calling for an end to apartheid while the sri efforts alone did not bring an end to apartheid it did focus persuasive international pressure on the south african business community the mid and late s saw the rise of sri’s focus on a diverse range of other issues including tobacco stocks mutual fund proxy disclosure and other diverse focuses since the late s sri has become increasingly defined as a means to promote environmentally sustainable development many investors consider effects of global climate change a significant business and investment risk ceres was founded in  by joan bavaria and dennis hayes coordinator of the first earth day as a network for investors environmental organizations and other public interest groups interested in working with companies to address environmental concerns since  representatives from the sri industry have gathered at the annual sri in the rockies conference to exchange ideas and gain momentum for new initiatives this conference is produced by first affirmative financial network an investment advisory firm that specializes in sustainable and responsible investing the conference has attracted over  persons annually since  the first sellside brokerage in the world to offer sri research was the brazilian bank unibanco the service was launched in january  by unibanco sri analyst christopher wells from the são paulo headquarters of the bank it was targeted at sri funds in europe and the us although it was sent to nonsri funds both in and out of brazil the research was about environmental and social issues but not governance issues regarding companies listed in brazil it was sent for free to unibancos clients the service lasted until mid two good things came out this research the idea was picked up by mike tyrrell who worked at jupiter an sri fund manager in london and who developed it into something much bigger and better at hsbc and then citigroup abn amros operation in brazil used this research to create the first sri fund in an emerging market launched in november  as of late  this fund called fundo ethical was the brazilian operations biggest and best performing stock fund of any kind abn amros operation in brazil was bought by santander in  drawing on the industrys experience using divestment as a tool against apartheid the sudan divestment task force was established in  in response to the genocide occurring in the darfur region of the sudan support from the us government followed with the sudan accountability and divestment act of  more recently some social investors have sought to address the rights of indigenous peoples around the world who are affected by the business practices of various companies the  sri in the rockies conference held a special preconference specifically to address the concerns of indigenous peoples healthy working conditions fair wages product safety and equal opportunity employment also remain headline concerns for many social investors in the mids some funds developed gender lens investing strategies to promote workplace equity and general welfare of women and girls current strategiesedit socially responsible investing is a growing market in both the us and europe in particular it has become an important principle guiding the investment strategies of various funds and accounts governmentcontrolled fundsedit governmentcontrolled funds such as pension funds are often very large players in the investment field and are being pressured by the citizenry and by activist groups to adopt investment policies which encourage ethical corporate behavior respect the rights of workers consider environmental concerns and avoid violations of human rights one outstanding endorsement of such policies is the government pension fund of norway which is mandated to avoid investments which constitute an unacceptable risk that the fund may contribute to unethical acts or omissions such as violations of fundamental humanitarian principles serious violations of human rights gross corruption or severe environmental damages many pension funds are currently under pressure to disinvest from the arms company bae systems partially due to a campaign run by the campaign against arms trade caat liverpool city council has passed a successful resolution to disinvest from the company but a similar attempt by the scottish green party in edinburgh city council was blocked by the liberal democrats mutual funds and etfsedit socially

subject to erisa there are legal limitations on the extent to which investment decisions can be based on factors other than maximizing plan participants economic returns shareholder advocacyedit shareholder resolutions are filed by a wide variety of institutional investors including public pension funds faithbased investors socially responsible mutual funds and labor unions in  faithbased organizations filed  resolutions while socially responsible funds filed  resolutions regulations governing shareholder resolutions vary from country to country in the united states they are determined primarily by the securities and exchange commission which regulates mutual funds and applies the  act and by the department of labor which regulates certain plans and applies erisa these regulatory regimes require pension plans and mutual funds to disclose how they voted on behalf of their investors us shareholders have organized various groups to facilitate jointly filing resolutions these include the council of institutional investors the interfaith center on corporate responsibility and the us sif from  to  more than  us institutions and investment management firms filed or cofiled proposals these institutions and money managers collectively controlled  trillion in assets at the end of  the top categories of environmental and social issues from  to  were political contributions and climate change and environmental issues community investingedit community investing a subset of socially responsible investing allows for investment directly into communitybased organizations community investing institutions use investor capital to finance or guarantee loans to individuals and organizations that have historically been denied access to capital by traditional financial institutions these loans are used for housing small business creation and education or personal development in the us or are made available to local financial institutions abroad to finance international community development the community investing institution typically provides training and other types of support and expertise to ensure the success of the loan and its returns for investors community investing grew almost  from  to  assets held and invested locally by community development financial institutions cdfis based in the us totaled  billion at the start of  up from  billion in  investing strategiesedit investing in capital marketsedit social investors use several strategies to maximize financial return and attempt to maximize social good these strategies seek to create change by shifting the cost of capital down for sustainable firm and up for the nonsustainable ones the proponents argue that access to capital is what drives the future direction of development negative screeningedit negative screening excludes certain securities from investment consideration based on social or environmental criteria for example many socially responsible investors screen out tobacco company investments the longestrunning sri index the domini —now the msci kld —was started in may  it has continued to perform competitively —with average annualized total returns of  through december  compared with  for the sp  despite this impressive growth it has long been commonly perceived that sri brings smaller returns than unrestricted investing socalled sin stocks including purveyors of tobacco alcohol gambling and defense contractors were banned from portfolios on moral or ethical grounds and shutting out entire industries hurts performance the critics said however in a comprehensive study financial economists lobe roithmeier and walkshäusl taking the position of the advocatus diaboli answer the question whether to invest in a socially responsible way – or not they create a set of global and domestic sin indexes consisting of  publicly traded socially irresponsible stocks around the world belonging to the sextet of sin adult entertainment alcohol gambling nuclear power tobacco and weapons they compare their stock market performance directly with a set of virtue comparables consisting of the most important international socially responsible investment indexes they find no compelling evidence that ethical and unethical screens lead to a significant difference in their financial performance which is in contrast with the results of prior studies on sinful investing divestmentedit divesting is the act of removing stocks from a portfolio based on mainly ethical nonfinancial objections to certain business activities of a corporation recently calstrs california state teachers retirement system announced the removal of more than  million in tobacco holdings from its investment portfolio after  months of financial analysis and deliberations shareholder activismedit shareholder activism efforts attempt to positively influence corporate behavior these efforts include initiating conversations with corporate management on issues of concern and submitting and voting proxy resolutions these activities are undertaken with the belief that social investors working cooperatively can steer management on a course that will improve financial performance over time and enhance the well being of the stockholders customers employees vendors and communities recent movements have also been reported of investor relations activism in which investor relations firms assist groups of shareholder activists in an organized push for change within a corporation this is done typically by leveraging their enhanced knowledge of the corporation its management often via direct relationships and the securities laws as a whole hedge funds are also major activist investors while some pursue socially responsible investing goals many simply are seeking to maximize fund returns pension plans subject to erisa are somewhat more constrained in their ability to engage in shareholder activism or the use of plan assets to promote public policy positions any expenditure of plan assets must be aimed at enhancing participants retirement income shareholder engagementedit a less vocal subtype of shareholder
