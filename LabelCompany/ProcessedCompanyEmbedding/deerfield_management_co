implicated are collectively responsible for more than  annual deaths in the united states and the economic burden on the public health system due to vhds is estimated in the billions of dollars objective the aim of this study was to assess the number of mitral valve disease hospitalizations and surgical procedures in the united states during the period   materials and methods patient data were extracted from the healthcare cost and utilization project hcup national inpatient sample nis the nis is the largest publicly available allpayer inpatient healthcare database in the united states containing a  stratified systematic random sample of discharges from all us community hospitals the most recent  years of available data  were used for this analysis patients diagnosed with mitral valve disease were identified using the appropriate international classification of diseases th revision icd diagnosis codes icd procedure codes were used to identify surgeries to repair or replace the mitral valve including transcatheter mitral valve repair tmvr open repair tissue graft and synthetic replacement categorical variables were analyzed using the chisquared test while continuous variables were analyzed using a oneway analysis of variance anova or independent samples ttest results there were  discharge records in  with a diagnosis of mitral valve disease using hcup’s sampling weights this extrapolates to  hospitalizations in the united states this is a slight decrease from  when there were  estimated hospitalizations the mean age of patients hospitalized for mitral valve

publish a report on regulatory and hta scientific advice for small and medium enterprises  march  new york  brusselsbusiness wire europabio the european association for bioindustries and the deerfield institute have partnered to carry out a survey on the current state of regulatory and health technology assessment hta advice with a special focus on small and medium sized enterprises smes the findings suggest early regulatory scientific and hta advice may help smes to better prepare and manage their clinical programs toward facilitating both regulatory approval and positive hta recommendationsand therefore contribute to their increased competitiveness main findings “despite agreement amongst all stakeholders that early interactions between regulatory hta authorities and smes would be positive ensuring that these interactions actually take place is not straightforward given that many smes focus on the early stage of development and can be quite limited in terms of personnel and resources the process of seeking such advice can be perceived as lengthyformal and cumbersome” said miriam gargesi director for healthcare biotechnology at europabio however the findings also show that both the authorities and the smes acknowledged the need to become more flexible and to diversify and increase the number of interactions between them “early dialogue activities have the potential to reduce drug development uncertainties related to regulatory and hta assessments while existing hta scientific advice programs have made a good start and europabio member companies have reported positive experiences so far there are a number of other needs to be metparticularly in the areas of information training and coordination” said paolo morgese director of european research for the deerfield institute and chair of europabio’s hta topic group background phase iii clinical trials are the last and vital development step before submitting healthcare biotech products for approval while the costs for these trials are rising the success rate is still  at phase iii according to the uks centre for medicines research success at phase iii clinical trials is not the end of the story as drugs will still have to go through regulatory and hta evaluation processes before being accessible to european patients reviews from the european medicines agency and to a larger extent from hta authoritieshave proven to be a significant challenge for biotech smes often resulting in very limited access to new biotech drugs against this context and the resulting significant financial burden incurred during phase iii clinical trials companies regulatory and hta authorities are starting to work together at earlier stages of drug development in order to make drug development more efficient this could eventually help companies better understand what data the authorities need earlier in the process thus leading to better designed clinical trials and fewer drugs failing at the approval stage or not being reimbursed the full report is available on the websites of deerfield httpgooglhraum and europabio httpgooglvkdpzz  about europabio europabio is the european association of bio
