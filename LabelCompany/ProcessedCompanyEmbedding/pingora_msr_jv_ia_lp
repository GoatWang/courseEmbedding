investment company portfolio investments held by the company are not consolidated into the consolidated financial statements the portfolio investments held by the company are included on the statements of assets and liabilities as investments at fair value fair value measurements the company values its investments in accordance with fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc  which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date a liabilitys fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor asc  prioritizes the use of observable market prices derived from such prices over entityspecific inputs where observable prices or inputs are not  fifth street finance corp notes to consolidated financial statements in thousands except share and per share amounts percentages and as otherwise indicated available or reliable valuation techniques are applied these valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the investments or market and the investments complexity hierarchical levels defined by asc  and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities are as follows   • level  — unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date • level  — observable inputs other than level  prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data at the measurement date for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities • level  — unobservable inputs that reflect managements best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases an investments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment generally it is expected that all of the companys investment securities will be valued using level  inputs this includes investment securities that are valued using bid and ask prices obtained from independent third party pricing services or directly from brokers these investments are generally classified as level  because the quoted prices may be indicative in nature for securities that are in an inactive market may be for similar securities or may require adjustments for investmentspecific factors or restrictions financial instruments with readily available quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment inherent in measuring fair value as such the investment advisers capital markets group obtains and analyzes readily available market quotations provided by independent pricing services for all of the companys senior secured debt investments for which quotations are available in determining the fair value of a particular investment pricing services use observable market information including both binding and nonbinding indicative quotations the investment adviser evaluates the prices obtained from independent pricing services based on available market information and company specific data that could affect the credit quality andor fair value of the investment investments for which market quotations are readily available may be valued at such market quotations in order to validate market quotations the investment adviser looks at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value including the source and nature of the quotations the investment adviser does not adjust the prices unless it has a reason to believe any such market quotations are not reflective of the fair value of an investment examples of events that would cause market quotations to not reflect fair value could include cases when a security trades infrequently causing a quoted purchase or sale price to become stale or in the event of a fire sale by a distressed seller in these instances the company values such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available as discussed below if the quotation provided by the pricing service is based on only one or two market sources the company performs additional procedures to corroborate such information which may include the bond yield approach discussed below and a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the credit quality and market trends affecting the portfolio company the company performs detailed valuations of its debt and equity investments for which market quotations are not readily available or are deemed not to represent fair value of the investments the company typically uses two different valuation techniques the first valuation technique is an analysis of the enterprise value ev of the portfolio company ev means the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time the primary method for determining ev uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio companys ebitda generally defined as earnings before net interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization ebitda multiples are typically determined based upon review of market comparable transactions and publicly traded comparable companies if any the company may also employ other valuation multiples to determine ev such as revenues the second method for determining ev uses a discounted cash flow analysis whereby future expected cash flows of the portfolio company are discounted to determine a present value using estimated discount rates typically a weighted average cost of capital based on costs of debt and equity consistent with current market conditions the ev analysis is typically performed to determine the value of equity investments to determine if there is credit impairment for debt investments and to determine the value for debt investments that the company is deemed to control under the  act if debt investments are credit impaired an ev analysis may be used to value such debt investments however in addition to the methods outlined above other alternative methods such as an asset liquidation model expected recovery model or a recent observable or pending transaction may be utilized to estimate ev the second valuation technique is a bond yield approach which is typically performed for noncredit impaired debt investments to determine fair value using a bond  fifth street finance corp notes to consolidated financial statements in thousands except share and per share amounts percentages and as otherwise indicated yield approach a current price is imputed for the investment based upon an assessment of the expected market yield for a similarly structured investment with a similar level of risk in the bond yield approach the company considers the current contractual interest rate the capital structure and other terms of the investment relative to risk of the company and the specific investment a key determinant of risk among other things is the leverage through the investment relative to the ev of the portfolio company as debt investments held by the company are substantially illiquid with no active transaction market the company depends on primary market data including newly funded transactions and industry specific market movements as well as secondary market data with respect to high yield debt instruments and syndicated loans as inputs in determining the appropriate market yield as applicable in accordance with asc  certain investments that qualify as investment companies in accordance with asc  may be valued using net asset value as a practical expedient for fair value the company estimates the fair value of privately held warrants using a black scholes pricing model which includes an analysis of various factors and subjective assumptions including the current stock price by analyzing the portfolio companys operating performance and financial condition and general market conditions the expected period until exercise expected volatility of the underlying stock price expected dividends and the risk free rate changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates the companys board of directors undertakes a multistep valuation process each quarter in connection with determining the fair value of the companys investments • the quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment advisers valuation team in conjunction with the investment advisers portfolio management and capital markets teams • preliminary valuations are then reviewed and discussed with principals of the investment adviser • separately independent valuation firms engaged by the board of directors prepare valuations of the companys investments on a selected basis for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment and submit the reports to the company and provide such reports to the investment adviser and the audit committee of the board of directors • the investment adviser compares and contrasts its preliminary valuations to the valuations of the independent valuation firms and prepares a valuation report for the audit committee of the board of directors • the audit committee of the board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations with the portfolio managers of the investment adviser and the investment adviser responds and supplements the preliminary valuations to reflect any discussions between the investment adviser and the audit committee • the audit committee of the board of directors makes a recommendation to the board of directors regarding the fair value of the level  investments in the companys portfolio and • the board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each level  investment in the companys portfolio the fair value of each of the companys investments at december   and september   was determined in good faith by the board of directors the board of directors has authorized the engagement of independent valuation firms to provide valuation assistance the company will continue to engage independent valuation firms to provide assistance regarding the determination of the fair value of a portion of the companys portfolio securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment each quarter as of december     of the companys portfolio at fair value was valued either using market quotations or by independent valuation firms the percentage of our portfolio valued by independent valuation firms may vary from period to period based on the availability of market quotations for our portfolio investments during the respective periods however the board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for the valuation of the portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to the companys valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process investment income interest and dividend income interest income adjusted for accretion of original issue discount oid is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected the company stops accruing interest on investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible investments that are expected to pay regularly scheduled interest in cash are generally placed on nonaccrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest cash payments will be collected cash interest payments received on investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management’s judgment such nonaccrual  fifth street finance corp notes to consolidated financial statements in thousands except share and per share amounts percentages and as otherwise indicated investments are restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest are paid in cash and in management’s judgment the portfolio company is likely to continue timely payment of its remaining interest in connection with its investment the company sometimes receives nominal cost equity that is valued as part of the negotiation process with the particular portfolio company when the company receives nominal cost equity the company allocates its cost basis in its investment between its debt securities and its nominal cost equity at the time of origination any resulting discount from recording the loan or otherwise purchasing a security at a discount is accreted into interest income over the life of the loan for the companys secured borrowings the interest earned on the entire loan balance is recorded within interest income and the interest earned by the buyer from the partial loan sales is recorded within interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations the company generally recognizes dividend income on the exdividend date distributions received from equity investments are evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital generally the company will not record distributions from equity investments as dividend income unless there are sufficient earnings at the portfolio company prior to the distribution distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment the company reversed  million of dividend income during the three months ended december   upon the receipt of updated information from a portfolio company regarding the characterization of a cash distribution received in a prior period the related part i incentive fee reimbursement related to this adjustment was recorded during the three months ended december   pik interest income the company has investments in debt securities which contain pik interest provisions pik interest is computed at the contractual rate specified in each investment agreement and added to the principal balance of the investment and recorded as income pik interest on certain of the companys debt investments which represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term is generally recorded on the accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected the company generally ceases accruing pik interest if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or if the company does not expect the portfolio company to be able to pay all principal and interest due the companys decision to cease accruing pik interest involves subjective judgments and determinations based on available information about a particular portfolio company including whether the portfolio company is current with respect to its payment of principal and interest on its loans and debt securities monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for the portfolio company the companys assessment of the portfolio companys business development success including product development profitability and the portfolio companys overall adherence to its business plan information obtained by the company in connection with periodic formal update interviews with the portfolio companys management and if appropriate the private equity sponsor and information about the general economic and market conditions in which the portfolio company operates based on this and other information the company determines whether to cease accruing pik interest on a loan or debt security the companys determination to cease accruing pik interest on a loan or debt security is generally made well before the companys full writedown of such loan or debt security fee income fee income consists of the monthly servicing fees

income determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid in order to be eligible for tax benefits allowed to a ric under subchapter m of the code the company anticipates paying out as a distribution all or substantially all of those amounts the amount to be paid out as a dividend is determined by the board of directors and is based on management’s estimate of the company’s annual taxable income the company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan “drip” that provides for reinvestment of any distributions the company declares in cash on behalf of its stockholders unless a stockholder elects to receive cash as a result if the company’s board of directors authorizes and the company declares a cash distribution then the company’s stockholders who have not “opted out” of the company’s drip will have their cash distribution automatically reinvested in additional shares of the company’s common stock rather than receiving the cash distribution if the company’s shares are trading at a premium to net asset value the company typically issues new shares to implement the drip if the company’s shares are trading at a discount to net asset value the company typically purchases shares in the open market in connection with the company’s obligations under the drip for income tax purposes the company estimates that its distributions for the calendar year will be composed primarily of ordinary income and will be appropriately reported to the internal revenue service and stockholders for the calendar year to the extent that the company’s taxable earnings fall

elected to be regulated as a business development company under the investment company act of  as amended or the  act we have qualified and elected to be treated as a ric under the internal revenue code of  as amended or the code for tax purposes we generally lend to and invest in small and midsized companies primarily in connection with investments by private equity sponsors we define small and midsized companies as those with annual ebitda generally defined as earnings before net interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization between  million and  million our investment objective is to maximize our portfolio’s total return by generating current income from our debt investments and to a lesser extent capital appreciation from our equity investments we are externally managed by fifth street management llc or the investment adviser a subsidiary of fifth street asset management inc or fsam a publicly traded alternative asset manager pursuant to an investment advisory agreement fsc ct llc or fsc ct a subsidiary of the investment adviser also provides certain administrative and other services necessary for us to operate  critical accounting policies basis of presentation our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or gaap and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on form q and regulation sx in the opinion of management all adjustments of a normal recurring nature considered necessary for the fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements have been made all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated we are an investment company following the accounting and reporting guidance in financial accounting standards board or fasb accounting standards codification or asc topic  financial servicesinvestment companies or asc  investment valuation we are required to report our investments that are not publicly traded or for which current market values are not readily available at fair value the fair value is deemed to be the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we value our investments in accordance with fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  or asc  which defines fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date a liabilitys fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor asc  prioritizes the use of observable market prices derived from such prices over entityspecific inputs where observable prices or inputs are not available or reliable valuation techniques are applied these valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the investments or market and the investments complexity hierarchical levels defined by asc  and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities are as follows   • level  — unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date • level  — observable inputs other than level  prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data at the measurement date for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities • level  — unobservable inputs that reflect managements best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy established by asc  in such cases an investments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment generally it is expected that all of our investment securities will be valued using level  inputs this includes investment securities that are valued using bid and ask prices obtained from independent third party pricing services or directly from brokers these investments are generally classified as level  because the quoted prices may be indicative in nature for securities that are in an inactive market may be for similar securities or may require adjustments for investmentspecific factors or restrictions financial instruments with readily available quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment inherent in measuring fair value as such our investment advisers capital markets group obtains and analyzes readily available market quotations provided by independent pricing services for all of our senior secured debt investments for which quotations are available in determining the fair value of a particular investment pricing services use observable market information including both binding and nonbinding indicative quotations our investment adviser evaluates the prices obtained from independent pricing services based on available market information and company specific data that could affect the credit quality andor fair value of the investment investments for which market quotations are readily available may be valued at such market quotations in order to validate market quotations our investment adviser looks at a number of factors to determine if the quotations are representative of fair value including the source and nature of the quotations our investment adviser does not adjust the prices unless it has a reason to believe any such market quotations are not reflective of the fair value of an investment examples of events that would cause market quotations to not reflect fair value could include cases when a security trades infrequently causing a quoted purchase or sale price to become stale or in the event of a fire sale  by a distressed seller in these instances we value such investments by using the valuation procedure that it uses with respect to assets for which market quotations are not readily available as discussed below if the quotation provided by the pricing service is based on only one or two market sources we perform additional procedures to corroborate such information which may include the bond yield approach discussed below and a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the credit quality and market trends affecting the portfolio company we perform detailed valuations of our debt and equity investments for which market quotations are not readily available or are deemed not to represent fair value of the investments we typically use two different valuation techniques the first valuation technique is an analysis of the enterprise value or ev of the portfolio company ev means the entire value of the portfolio company to a market participant including the sum of the values of debt and equity securities used to capitalize the enterprise at a point in time the primary method for determining ev uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio companys ebitda ebitda multiples are typically determined based upon review of market comparable transactions and publicly traded comparable companies if any we may also employ other valuation multiples to determine ev such as revenues the second method for determining ev uses a discounted cash flow analysis whereby future expected cash flows of the portfolio company are discounted to determine a present value using estimated discount rates typically a weighted average cost of capital based on costs of debt and equity consistent with current market conditions the ev analysis is typically performed to determine the value of equity investments to determine if there is credit impairment for debt investments and to determine the value for debt investments that we are deemed to control under the  act if debt investments are credit impaired an ev analysis may be used to value such debt investments however in addition to the methods outlined above other alternative methods such as an asset liquidation model expected recovery model or a recent observable or pending transaction may be utilized to estimate ev the second valuation technique is a bond yield approach which is typically performed for noncredit impaired debt investments to determine fair value using a bond yield approach a current price is imputed for the investment based upon an assessment of the expected market yield for a similarly structured investment with a similar level of risk in the bond yield approach we consider the current contractual interest rate the capital structure and other terms of the investment relative to risk of the company and the specific investment a key determinant of risk among other things is the leverage through the investment relative to the ev of the portfolio company as debt investments held by us are substantially illiquid with no active transaction market we depend on primary market data including newly funded transactions and industry specific market movements as well as secondary market data with respect to high yield debt instruments and syndicated loans as inputs in determining the appropriate market yield as applicable in accordance with asc  certain investments that qualify as investment companies in accordance with asc  may be valued using net asset value as a practical expedient for fair value we estimate the fair value of privately held warrants using a black scholes pricing model which includes an analysis of various factors and subjective assumptions including but not limited to the current stock price by analyzing the portfolio companys operating performance and financial condition and general market conditions the expected period until exercise expected volatility of the underlying stock price expected dividends and the risk free rate changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates our board of directors undertakes a multistep valuation process each quarter in connection with determining the fair value of our investments • the quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by our investment advisers valuation team in conjunction with the investment advisers portfolio management and capital markets teams • preliminary valuations are then reviewed and discussed with principals of our investment adviser • separately independent valuation firms engaged by our board of directors prepare valuations of our investments on a selected basis for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment and submit the reports to us and provide such reports to our investment adviser and the audit committee of our board of directors • the investment adviser compares and contrasts its preliminary valuations to the valuations of the independent valuation firms and prepares a valuation report for the audit committee of our board of directors • the audit committee of our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations with the portfolio managers of the investment adviser and our investment adviser responds and supplements the preliminary valuations to reflect any discussions between our investment adviser and the audit committee • the audit committee of our board of directors makes a recommendation to our board of directors regarding the fair value of the level  investments in the companys portfolio and • our board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each level  investment in the companys portfolio  the fair value of our investments at december   and september   was determined in good faith by our board of directors our board of directors has authorized the engagement of independent valuation firms to provide valuation assistance we will continue to engage independent valuation firms to provide assistance regarding the determination of the fair value of a portion of our portfolio securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment each quarter as of december     of our portfolio at fair value was valued by independent valuation firms the percentage of our portfolio valued by independent valuation firms may vary from period to period based on the availability of market quotations for our portfolio investments during the respective periods typically a higher percentage of our portfolio is valued by independent valuation firms in our fiscal fourth quarter due to additional yearend procedures however our board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for the valuation of the portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process the percentages of our portfolio at fair value valued by independent valuation firms as of the end of each period during the current and two preceding fiscal years were as follows as of december       as of march       as of june       as of september       as of december       as of march       as of june       as of september       as of december       as of december   and september    approximately  and  respectively of our total assets represented investments in portfolio companies valued at prices equal to fair value revenue recognition interest and dividend income interest income adjusted for accretion of original issue discount or oid is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected we stop accruing interest on investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible investments that are expected to pay regularly scheduled interest in cash are generally placed on nonaccrual status when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest cash payments will be collected cash interest payments received on investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management’s judgment such nonaccrual investments are restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest are paid in cash and in management’s judgment are likely to continue timely payment of their remaining interest as of december    there were  investments on which we had stopped accruing cash andor payment in kind or pik interest or oid income in connection with our investment we sometimes receive nominal cost equity that is valued as part of the negotiation process with the particular portfolio company when we receive nominal cost equity we allocate our cost basis in the investment between debt securities and the nominal cost equity at the time of origination any resulting discount from recording the loan or otherwise purchasing a security at a discount is accreted into interest income over the life of the loan we generally recognize dividend income on the exdividend date distributions received from equity investments are evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital generally we will not record distributions from equity investments as dividend income unless there are sufficient earnings at the portfolio company prior to the distribution distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment fee income we receive a variety of fees in the ordinary course of business including servicing advisory amendment structuring and prepayment fees which are classified as fee income and recognized as they are earned we have also structured exit fees across certain of our portfolio investments to be received upon the future exit of those investments exit fees are payable upon the exit of a debt security these fees are to be paid to us upon the sooner to occur of i a sale of the borrower or substantially all of the assets of the borrower ii the maturity date of the loan or iii the date when full prepayment of the loan occurs the receipt of such fees is contingent upon the occurrence of one of the events listed above for each of the investments a percentage of these fees is included in net investment income over the life of the loan as of december    we had a receivable for  million in aggregate exit fees of one portfolio investment upon the future exit of this investment  pik interest our loans may contain contractual pik interest provisions the pik interest which represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term is generally recorded on the accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected we generally cease accruing pik interest if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or if we do not expect the portfolio company to be able to pay all principal and interest due our decision to cease accruing pik interest involves subjective judgments and determinations based on available information about a particular portfolio company including whether the portfolio company is current with respect to its payment of principal and interest on its loans and debt securities monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for the portfolio company our assessment of the portfolio companys business development success including product development profitability and the portfolio companys overall adherence to its business plan information obtained by us in connection with periodic formal update interviews with the portfolio companys management and if appropriate the private equity sponsor and information about the general economic and market conditions in which the portfolio company operates based on this and other information we determine whether to cease accruing pik interest on a loan or debt security when it is determined that pik interest is no longer collectible our determination to cease accruing pik interest on a loan or debt security is generally made well before our full writedown of such loan or debt security in addition if it is subsequently determined that we will not be able to collect any previously accrued pik interest the fair value of our loans or debt securities would decline by the amount of such previously accrued but uncollectible pik interest the accrual of pik interest on our debt investments increases the recorded cost basis of these investments in our consolidated financial statements and as a result increases the cost basis of these investments for purposes of computing the capital gains incentive fee payable by us to our investment adviser for a discussion of risks we are subject to as a result of our use of pik interest in connection with our investments see risk factors — risks relating to our business and structure — we may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we are required to recognize income for us federal income tax purposes before or without receiving cash representing such income — we may in the future choose to pay distributions partly in our own stock in which case you may be subject to tax in excess of the cash you receive and — our incentive fee may induce our investment adviser to make speculative investments in our annual report on form k for the year ended september   in addition if it is subsequently determined that we will not be able to collect any previously accrued pik interest the fair value of our loans or debt securities would decline by the amount of such previously accrued but uncollectible pik interest the accrual of pik interest on our debt investments increases the recorded cost basis of these investments both in our consolidated financial statements and for purposes of computing the capital gains incentive fee payable by us to our investment adviser to maintain our status as a ric pik income must be paid out to our stockholders as distributions even though we have not yet collected the cash and may never collect the cash relating to the pik interest accumulated pik interest was  million  or  of the fair value of our portfolio of investments as of december   and  million or  as of september    the net increases in loan balances as a result of contractual pik arrangements are separately identified in our consolidated statements of cash flows  portfolio composition our investments principally consist of loans purchased equity investments and equity grants in privatelyheld companies and senior loan fund jv i llc or together with its consolidated subsidiaries slf jv i our loans are typically secured by a first second or subordinated lien on the assets of the portfolio company and generally have terms of up to seven years but an expected average life of between three and four years we are currently focusing our origination efforts on a prudent mix of senior secured and subordinated loans which we believe will provide attractive riskadjusted returns while maintaining adequate credit protection the mix may change over time based on market conditions and managements view of where the best riskadjusted returns are available a summary of the composition of our investment portfolio at cost and fair value as a percentage of total investments is shown in the following tables

the net proceeds from future equity offerings and issuances of senior securities or future borrowings to the extent permitted by the  act our plans to raise capital may not be successful in this regard because our common stock has at times traded at a price below our thencurrent net asset value per share which has primarily been the case for several years and we are limited in our ability to sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share we may be limited in our ability to raise equity capital in addition we intend to distribute at least  of our taxable income as dividends to our stockholders each taxable year in connection with satisfying the requirements applicable to entities subject to tax as rics under subchapter m of the code see regulated investment company status and distributions below consequently we may not have the funds or the ability to fund new investments to make additional investments in our portfolio companies to fund our unfunded commitments to portfolio companies or to repay borrowings in addition the illiquidity of our portfolio investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired and if we are required to sell these investments we may realize significantly less than their recorded value as a business development company under the  act we generally are not permitted to incur indebtedness unless immediately after such borrowing we have an asset coverage for total borrowings of at least  ie the amount of debt may not exceed  of the value of our assets this requirement limits the amount that we may borrow we received exemptive relief from the sec to permit us to exclude the debt of our sbic subsidiaries guaranteed by the us small business administration or sba from the definition of senior securities in the  asset coverage ratio we are required to maintain under the  act as of december    we were in compliance with this asset coverage requirement as modified by our exemptive relief the amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing such as the maturity covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings our ability to raise funds through the issuance of shares of our common stock and the risks of such borrowings within the context of our investment outlook ultimately we only intend to use leverage if the expected returns from borrowing to make investments will exceed the cost of such borrowing to fund growth in our investment portfolio in the future we anticipate needing to raise additional capital from various sources including the equity markets and the securitization or other debtrelated markets which may or may not be available on favorable terms if at all we may from time to time be required to refinance previously issued debt securities upon their maturities for example we repaid in full our unsecured convertible notes on their maturity date of april   in order to fund this repayment we utilized cash on hand and borrowings under our ing revolving credit facility  significant capital transactions the following table reflects

maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a ric we may have to request a waiver of the sbas restrictions for our sbic subsidiaries to make certain distributions to maintain our ric status we cannot assure you that the sba will grant such waiver also the covenants under the sumitomo facility could under certain circumstances restrict funding and funding ii from making distributions to us and as a result hinder our ability to satisfy the distribution requirement associated with our ability to be subject to tax as a ric similarly the covenants contained in the ing facility may prohibit us from making distributions to our stockholders and as a result could hinder our ability to satisfy the distribution requirement associated with our ability to be subject to tax as a ric in addition we may retain for investment some or all of our net capital gains ie realized net longterm capital gains in excess of realized net shortterm capital losses and treat such amounts as deemed distributions to our stockholders if we do this our stockholders will be treated as if they received actual distributions of the capital gains we retained and then reinvested the net aftertax proceeds in our common stock our stockholders also may be eligible to claim tax credits or in certain circumstances tax refunds equal to their allocable share of the tax  we paid on the capital gains deemed distributed to them to the extent our taxable earnings for a fiscal and taxable year fall below the total amount of our dividend distributions for that fiscal and taxable year a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time in addition we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings applicable to us as a business development company under the  act and due to provisions in our credit facilities and debt instruments if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our taxable income annually we will suffer adverse tax consequences including possible loss of our ability to be subject to tax as a ric we cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level a ric may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its ric distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the ric subject to certain limitations regarding the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders if these and certain other requirements are met for us federal income tax purposes the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock we have no current intention of paying dividends in shares of our stock in accordance with these guidelines we may generate qualified interest income that may be exempt from united states withholding tax on foreign accounts a regulated ric is permitted to designate distributions of qualified interest income and shortterm capital gains as exempt from us withholding tax when paid to nonus shareholders with proper documentation the following table which may be subject to change as

base management fee of  of the value of our gross assets which includes any borrowings for investment purposes and excludes cash and cash equivalents and b an incentive fee based on our performance the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears and the fee for any partial month or quarter is appropriately prorated the incentive fee consists of two parts the first part is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears and equals  of our preincentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding quarter subject to a preferred return or hurdle and a catch up feature the “catchup” provision is intended to provide our investment adviser with an incentive fee of  on all of our preincentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when our preincentive fee net investment income exceeds  in any fiscal quarter there is no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter and accordingly there is no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly hurdle the second part is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year or upon termination of the investment advisory agreement and equals  of our realized capital gains on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of the year if any computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fee the investment advisory agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon no fewer than

obligation to do so for the three months ended december   and december    the investment adviser voluntarily and irrevocably waived a portion of the base management fee relating to partial loan sales

assets which includes any borrowings for investment purposes but excludes any cash and cash equivalents held at the end of each quarter on january   we announced that our investment adviser had agreed

agreed to a revised base management fee arrangement or the revised management fee for the period commencing on july   and remaining in effect until january   or the waiver period the revised management fee was intended to provide for a reduction in the base management fee payable by us to our investment adviser during the waiver period in connection with the issuance or sale of shares of our common stock including new shares issued as dividends or pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan but excluding certain nonordinary course transactions  neither the prior waiver of base management fees nor the revised management fee in any way implies that our investment adviser will agree to waive management or incentive fees in any future period the revised management fee did not result in any recalculations of the base management fee prior to the expiration of the waiver period pursuant to the administration agreement with fsc ct which is a whollyowned subsidiary of our investment adviser fsc ct furnishes us with the facilities including our principal executive offices and administrative services necessary to conduct our daytoday operations including equipment

chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december    the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules ae and de under the securities exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act” means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december    our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting that is described below our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective b material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of september   management has determined that the company did not design or maintain effective controls to internally communicate current accounting policies and procedures including the nature of supporting documentation required to validate certain portfolio company data this material weakness remained as of december   primarily because the remediation actions described below remain in process c remediation of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended september   we took a number of steps to remediate the aggregated material weakness including formalizing policies and procedures relating to fee income recognition and the communication of these policies and procedures throughout the organization further we added senior experienced accounting and financial reporting personnel with higher levels of experience outsourced a number of accounting and operation activities engaged a public accounting firm to assist on technical accounting matters and reallocated existing internal resources  during the fiscal year ending september   we have and will continue to take a number of additional steps to remediate this material weakness including the formalization of policies and procedures in other significant areas and the implementation of controls over the validation of portfolio company data management is committed to improving our internal control processes and believes that the measures described above should be sufficient to remediate the identified material weakness and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting  based on the steps we have taken to date and the anticipated timing of additional remediation measures and appropriate test work we expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be completed prior to the end of calendar year   we cannot assure you however that the steps taken will remediate such weakness nor can we be certain of whether additional actions will be required or the costs of any such actions d changes in internal controls over financial reporting other than the remediation efforts described above there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the first fiscal quarter of  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting  part ii — other information item
