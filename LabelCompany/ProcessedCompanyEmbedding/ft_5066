the rs®ft trusted filter has been developed for a scenario consisting of a stanag  message handling application involving a radio andor modem interface and a remote control protocol the device provides firewall functionality for the radios control information inserted in the control path of a system the filter provides strict redblack separation this ensures that only explicitly permitted control commands are transmitted and prevents unintentional data leakage over the control interface one aspect often neglected in a communications system is the threat caused by the transmission of control information the path for control information is necessarily nearly always plain as a result it can be deliberately or unwittingly abused eg through a programming error to circumvent the encryption mode and transmit sensitive information openly the rs®ft protects the control path and prevents accidental diversion of red data to the black side of the system key facts rigid enforcement of classification boundary between red and black data prevents data leakage over the control interface operates in systems classified up to secret builtin tests and access control audiovisual status
