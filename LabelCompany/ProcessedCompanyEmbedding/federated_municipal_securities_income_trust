shareholder of the fund you incur two types of costs  transaction costs including sales charges loads on purchase or redemption payments and  ongoing costs including management fees and to the extent applicable distribution b fees andor shareholder services fees and other fund expenses this example is intended to help you to understand your ongoing costs in dollars of investing in the fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds it is based on an investment of  invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire period from march   to august   actual expenses the first section of the table below provides information about actual account values and actual expenses you may use the information in this section together with the amount you invested to estimate the expenses that you incurred over the period simply divide your account value by  for example an  account value divided by    then multiply the result by the number in the first section under the heading entitled “expenses paid during period” to estimate the expenses attributable to your investment during this period hypothetical example for comparison purposes the second section of the table below provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the funds actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of  per year before expenses which is not the funds actual return thus you should not use the hypothetical account values and expenses to estimate the actual ending account balance or your expenses for the period rather these figures are required to be provided to enable you to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the fund with other funds to do so compare this  hypothetical example with the  hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds annual shareholder report  please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transaction costs such as sales charges loads on purchase or redemption payments therefore the second section of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only and will not help you

prior to the close of business on november   refers to performance expenses and other information of the predecessor fund which are the performance expenses and other information of the fund for the relevant period as a result of the reorganization  the funds investment advsier has elected to change the funds broadbased securities market index to the main index from the barclays capital municipal bond index bcmb the main index is more representative of the securities in which the fund invests the main index is a broad comprehensive market valueweighted index following approximately  bond issues that are exempt from us federal income taxes or subject to the alternative minimum tax amt eligibility criteria for inclusion in the main index include but are not limited to the bond issuer must be a state including the commonwealth of puerto rico and us territories or a local government or agency where interest on the bond is exempt from us federal income taxes or subject to the amt the bond must be held by a mutual fund for which standard  poors securities evaluations inc provides prices it must be denominated in us dollars and have a minimum par amount of  million and the bond must

includes both zero coupon bonds and bond subject to the amt neither the main index nor bcmb are adjusted to reflect sales charges expenses and other fees that the securities and exchange commission sec requires to be reflected in the funds performance it is not possible to invest directly in an index  morningstar figures represent the average of the total returns reported by all the mutual funds designated by morningstar as falling into the respective category indicated funds designated within the mstarhym include those that invest at least  of assets in highincome municipal securities that are not rated or that are rated by a major agency such as standard  poors or moodys investor service at the level of bbb considered part of the high yield universe within the municipal industry and below they do not reflect sales charges annual shareholder report  during the reporting period the most significant factors affecting the funds performance relative to the main index were a selection of lowerquality investmentgrade and noninvestmentgrade securities these securities typically have higher yields than high quality investmentgrade securities available in the market b security selection particularly of inverse floaters these securities typically have higher yields due to the leverage of the security c selection of intermediate to longterm taxexempt municipal bonds that typically yield more than shortterm taxexempt municipal bonds due to the upward sloping yield curve d active adjustment of the funds duration which indicates the portfolio sensitivity to changes in interest rates and e allocation of the funds portfolio among securities of similar issuers referred to as sectors the following discussion focuses on the performance of the funds class a shares the  total return of the class a shares for the reporting period consisted of  of taxexempt dividends and reinvestments and  of price appreciation in the net asset value of the shares  investmentgrade

securities of a comparable quality credit ratings are an indication of the risk that a security will default they do not protect a security from credit risk lowerrated bonds typically offer higher yields to help compensate investors for the increased risk associated with them among these risks are lower creditworthiness greater price volatility more risk to principal and income than with higherrated securities and increased possibilities of default  bond prices are sensitive to changes in interest rates and a rise in interest rates can cause a decline in their prices  duration is a

modest income growth and lower housing wealth being major contributors to this economic environment yields on nominal treasury coupon securities fell noticeably during the period and treasury auctions

“fed” kept constant its holdings of securities at the current levels by reinvesting principal payments from agency debt and mortgagebacked securities in longer term treasury securities and rolling over its holdings of treasury debt as it matured the fed maintained the target range for the federal funds rate between  and  during the entire period the combined fiscal and monetary stimuli drove an impressive rebound in the valuation of risky assets taxexempt municipal credit spreads declined significantly as the spread between  year bbbrated and aaarated taxexempt municipal bonds declined by

federal financial support programs for state governments were put in place to stimulate local economies and boost confidence the build america bonds program reduced the supply of taxexempt municipal bonds issued helping to create a shortage of taxexempt bonds available in the market ongoing strong demand for yield from investors as money market rates remained very low the expectations of higher marginal tax rates and strong mutual fund flows led to solid demand for taxexempt debt these factors helped to create the supply and demand imbalance that enabled the taxexempt municipal market to recover and provide positive returns during the period the credit fundamentals of the taxexempt municipal bond market have shown continued deterioration in such credit factors as pension funding requirements real estate values and revenue growth although credit remained relatively weak taxexempt municipal high yield bonds performed well during the period as liquidity returned to the market annual shareholder report  credit quality during the month reporting period lower investmentgrade and noninvestmentgrade taxexempt municipal debt outperformed due to tightening of credit spreads this helped the funds performance because of the funds holdings in lower investmentgrade taxexempt municipal bonds bonds rated bbb or unrated bonds of comparable quality and noninvestmentgrade taxexempt municipal bonds which averaged nearly  of the funds portfolio over the course of the reporting period the fund increased its allocation to bbbrated and noninvestmentgrade bonds in order to take advantage of credit spreads which were wider than historic averages the funds exposure to nonrated bonds decreased as a number of nonrated prerefunded bonds were sold although these prerefunded bonds were nonrated they were actually highquality bonds so their sale benefitted the fund security selection on an historical basis inverse floating rate securities typically have higher yields due to the leverage of the security these securities however typically are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and credit spreads individual securities saw both positive and negative price movement for idiosyncratic reasons as a result the funds allocation to inverse floating rate securities during the month reporting period had a positive contribution to the funds performance maturity and yield curve during the month reporting period the fund primarily purchased securities on the longer end of the taxexempt municipal bond yield curve  year maturity bonds but also made selective purchases in the short and intermediate areas of the yield curve the funds heavy position in bonds maturing in  years or more helped the funds absolute returns as interest rates fell along the yield curve and longer bonds outperformed shorter bonds duration as determined at the end of the month reporting period the funds dollarweighted average duration was  years duration management remained a significant component of the funds investment strategy the shorter a funds duration is relative to an index the less its net asset value will react as interest rates change as rates fell the funds longer duration relative to the main index contributed to positive relative fund performance sector during the month reporting period the fund was overweight as compared to the main index in hospitals senior care and industrial development bonds all of which outperformed and helped the funds performance in general the funds allocation to riskier sectors contributed positively to its performance during the reporting period  credit ratings pertain only to the securities in the portfolio and do not protect fund shares against market risk annual shareholder report  growth of a  investment  class a shares

fund in the preparation of its financial statements these policies are in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap investment valuation in calculating its net asset value nav the fund generally values investments as follows fixedincome securities acquired with remaining maturities greater than  days are fair valued using price evaluations provided by a pricing service approved by the board of trustees the “trustees” fixedincome securities acquired with remaining maturities of  days or less are valued at their cost adjusted for the accretion of any discount or amortization of any premium shares of other mutual funds are valued based upon their reported navs derivative contracts listed on exchanges are valued at their reported settlement or closing price overthecounter otc derivative contracts are fair valued using price evaluations provided by a pricing service approved by the trustees if the fund cannot obtain a price or price evaluation from a pricing service for an investment the fund may attempt to value the investment based upon the mean of bid and asked quotations or fair value the investment based on price evaluations from one or more dealers if any price quotation price evaluation or other pricing source is not readily available when the nav is calculated the fund uses the fair value of the investment determined in accordance with the procedures described below there can be no assurance that the fund could purchase or sell an investment at the price used to calculate the funds nav fair valuation and significant events procedures the trustees have authorized the use of pricing services to provide evaluations of the current fair value of certain investments for purposes of calculating the nav factors considered by pricing services in evaluating an investment include the yields or prices of investments of comparable quality coupon maturity call rights and other potential prepayments terms and type reported transactions indications as to values from dealers and general market conditions some pricing services provide a single price evaluation reflecting the bidside of annual shareholder report  the market for an investment a “bid” evaluation other pricing services offer both bid evaluations and price evaluations indicative of a price between the prices bid and asked for the investment a “mid” evaluation the fund normally uses bid evaluations for us treasury and agency securities mortgagebacked securities and municipal securities the fund normally uses mid evaluations for other types of fixedincome securities and otc derivative contracts in the event that market quotations and price evaluations are not available for an investment the fair value of the investment is determined in accordance with procedures adopted by the trustees the trustees also have adopted procedures requiring an investment to be priced at its fair value whenever the adviser determines that a significant event affecting the value of the investment has occurred between the time as of which the price of the investment would otherwise be determined and the time as of which the nav is computed an event is considered significant if there is both an affirmative expectation that the investments value will change in response to the event and a reasonable basis for quantifying the resulting change in value examples of significant events that may occur after the close of the principal market on which a security is traded or after the time of a price evaluation provided by a pricing service or a dealer include with respect to price evaluations of fixedincome securities determined before the close of regular trading on the nyse actions by the federal reserve open market committee and other significant trends in us fixedincome markets political or other developments affecting the economy or markets in which an issuer conducts its operations or its securities are traded and announcements concerning matters such as acquisitions recapitalizations litigation developments a natural disaster affecting the issuers operations or regulatory changes or market developments affecting the issuers industry the fund may seek to obtain more current quotations or price evaluations from alternative pricing sources if a reliable alternative pricing source is not available the fund will determine the fair value of the investment using another method approved by the trustees investment income gains and losses expenses and distributions investment transactions are accounted for on a tradedate basis

mr albrecht has received the chartered financial analyst designation and an ms in public management from carnegie mellon universityannual shareholder report  evaluation and approval of advisory contract  may  federated municipal high yield advantage fund the “fund” the funds board reviewed the funds investment advisory contract at meetings held in may  the boards decision regarding the contract reflects the exercise of its business judgment on whether to continue the existing arrangements in this connection the federated funds board had previously appointed a senior officer whose duties include specified responsibilities relating to the process by which advisory fees are to be charged to a federated fund the senior officer has the authority to retain consultants experts or staff as may be reasonably necessary to assist in the performance of his duties reports directly to the board and may be terminated only with the approval of a majority of the independent members of the board the senior officer prepared and furnished to the board an independent written evaluation that covered topics discussed below the board considered that evaluation along with other information in deciding to approve the advisory contract during its review of the contract the board considered compensation and benefits received by the adviser this included the fees received for services provided to the fund by other entities in the federated organization and research services if any received by the adviser from brokers that execute federated fund trades as well as advisory fees the board is also familiar with and considered judicial decisions concerning allegedly excessive investment advisory fees which have indicated that the following factors may be relevant to an advisers fiduciary duty with respect to its receipt of compensation from a fund the nature and quality of the services provided by the adviser including the performance of the fund the advisers cost of providing the services the extent to which the adviser may realize “economies of scale” as a fund grows larger any indirect benefits that may accrue to the adviser and its affiliates as a result of the advisers relationship with a fund performance and expenses of comparable funds and the extent to which the independent board members are fully informed about all facts the board deems relevant bearing on the advisers services and fees the board further considered management fees including any components thereof charged to institutional and other clients of the adviser for what might be viewed as like services and the cost to the adviser and its affiliates of supplying services pursuant to the management fee agreements excluding any intracorporate profit and profit margins of the adviser and its affiliates for supplying such services the board was aware of these factors and was guided by them in its review of the funds advisory contract to the extent it considered them to be appropriate and relevant as discussed further below annual shareholder report  the board considered and weighed these circumstances in light of its substantial accumulated experience in governing the fund and working with federated on matters relating to the federated funds and was assisted in its deliberations by independent legal counsel throughout the year the board has requested and received substantial and detailed information about the fund and the federated organization that was in addition to the extensive materials that comprise and accompany the senior officers evaluation federated provided much of this information at each regular meeting of the board and furnished additional reports in connection with the particular meeting at which the boards formal review of the advisory contract occurred between regularly scheduled meetings the board also received information on particular matters as the need arose thus the boards consideration of the advisory contract included review of the senior officers evaluation accompanying data and additional reports covering such matters as the advisers investment philosophy revenue profitability personnel and processes investment and operating strategies the funds short and longterm performance in absolute terms both on a gross basis and net of expenses as well as in relationship to its particular investment program and certain competitor or “peer group” funds andor other benchmarks as appropriate and comments on the reasons for performance the funds investment objectives the funds expenses including the advisory fee itself and the overall expense structure of the fund both in absolute terms and relative to similar andor competing funds with due regard for contractual or voluntary expense limitations the use and allocation of brokerage commissions derived from trading the funds portfolio securities if any and the nature quality and extent of the advisory and other services provided to the fund by the adviser and its affiliates the board also considered the preferences and expectations of fund shareholders and their relative sophistication the continuing state of competition in the mutual fund industry and market practices the range of comparable fees for similar funds in the mutual fund industry the funds relationship to the federated family of funds which include a comprehensive array of funds with different investment objectives policies and strategies which are available for exchange without the incurrence of additional sales charges compliance and audit reports concerning the federated funds and the federated companies that service them including communications from regulatory agencies as well as federateds responses to any issues raised therein and relevant developments in the mutual fund industry and how the federated funds andor federated are responding to them the boards evaluation process is evolutionary the criteria considered and the emphasis placed on relevant criteria change in recognition of changing circumstances in the mutual fund marketplace with respect to the funds performance and expenses in particular the board has found the use of comparisons to other mutual funds with comparable investment programs to be relevant given the high degree of competition in the mutual fund business the board focused on comparisons with other similar annual shareholder report  mutual funds more heavily than nonmutual fund products or services because it is believed that they are more relevant for example other mutual funds are the products most like the fund they are readily available to fund shareholders as alternative investment vehicles and they are the type of investment vehicle in fact chosen and maintained by the funds investors the range of their fees and expenses therefore appears to be a generally reliable indication of what consumers have found to be reasonable in the precise marketplace in which the fund competes the funds ability to deliver competitive performance when compared to its peer group was a useful indicator of how the adviser is executing the funds investment program which in turn assisted the board in reaching a conclusion that the nature extent and quality of the advisers investment management services were such as to warrant continuation of the advisory contract in this regard the senior officer has reviewed federateds fees for providing advisory services to products outside the federated family of funds eg institutional and separate accounts he concluded that mutual funds and institutional accounts are inherently different products those differences include but are not limited to different types of targeted investors being subject to different laws and regulations different legal structures different average account sizes different associated costs different portfolio management techniques made necessary by different cash flows and portfolio manager time spent in review of securities pricing the senior officer did not consider these fee schedules to be determinative in judging the appropriateness of mutual fund advisory contracts the senior officer reviewed reports compiled by federated using data supplied by independent fund ranking organizations regarding the performance of and fees charged by other mutual funds noting his view that comparisons to fund peer groups are relevant in judging the reasonableness of proposed fees the funds performance fell below the median of the relevant peer group for the oneyear threeyear and fiveyear periods covered by the report the board discussed the funds performance with the adviser and recognized the efforts being undertaken by the adviser the board will continue to monitor these efforts and the performance of the fund the board also received financial information about federated including reports on the compensation and benefits federated derived from its relationships with the federated funds these reports covered not only the fees under the advisory contracts but also fees received by federateds subsidiaries for providing other services to the federated funds under separate contracts eg for serving as the federated funds administrator the reports also discussed any indirect benefit federated may derive from its receipt of research services from brokers who execute federated fund trades in addition the board considered the fact that in order for a fund to be competitive in the marketplace federated and its affiliates frequently waived fees andor reimbursed expenses and have disclosed to fund investors andor indicated to annual shareholder report  the board their intention to do so in the future where appropriate moreover the board receives regular reports regarding the institution or elimination of these voluntary waivers in this regard it was noted that the adviser has agreed to a reduction of  in the funds advisory fee at least through december   federated furnished reports requested by the senior officer that reported revenues on a fundbyfund basis and made estimates of the allocation of expenses on a fundbyfund basis using allocation methodologies specified by the senior officer the senior officer noted that although they may apply consistent allocation processes the inherent difficulties in allocating costs and the unavoidable arbitrary aspects of that exercise and the lack of consensus on how to allocate those costs may render such allocation reports unreliable the allocation reports were considered in the analysis by the board but were determined to be of limited use the board and the senior officer also reviewed a report compiled by federated comparing profitability information for federated to other publicly held fund management companies in this regard the senior officer noted the limited availability of such information but nonetheless concluded that federateds profit margins did not appear to be excessive and the board agreed the senior officers evaluation also discussed the notion of possible realization of “economies of scale” as a fund grows larger the board considered in this regard that the adviser has made significant and longterm investments in areas that support all of the federated funds such as personnel and processes for the portfolio management compliance and risk management functions and systems technology and that the benefits of these efforts as well as any economies should they exist were likely to be enjoyed by the fund complex as a whole finally the board also noted the absence of any applicable regulatory or industry guidelines on this subject which as discussed in the senior officers evaluation is compounded by the lack of any common industry practice or general pattern with respect to structuring fund advisory fees with “breakpoints” that serve to reduce the fee as the fund attains a certain size the senior officer did not recommend institution of breakpoints in pricing federateds fund advisory services at this time it was noted in the materials for the board meeting that for the period covered by the report the funds investment advisory fee after waivers and expense reimbursements if any was below the median of the relevant peer group the board reviewed the fees and other expenses of the fund with the adviser and was satisfied that the overall expense structure of the fund remained competitive the senior officers evaluation noted his belief that the information and observations contained in his evaluation supported a finding that the proposed management fees are reasonable and that federated appeared to provide appropriate administrative services to the fund for the fees paid under these annual shareholder report  circumstances no changes were recommended to and no objection was raised to the continuation of the funds advisory contract the board concluded that the nature quality and scope of services provided the fund by the adviser and its affiliates were satisfactory in its decision to continue an existing investment advisory contract the board was mindful of the potential disruptions of the funds operations and various risks uncertainties and other effects that could occur as a result of a decision to terminate or not renew an advisory contract in particular the board recognized that many shareholders have invested in the fund on the strength of the advisers industry standing and reputation and with the expectation that the adviser will have a continuing role in providing advisory services to the fund thus the boards approval of the advisory contract reflected the fact that it is the shareholders who have effectively selected the adviser by virtue of having invested in the fund the board based its decision to approve the advisory contract on the totality of the circumstances and relevant factors and with a view to past and future longterm considerations not all of the factors and considerations identified above were necessarily relevant to the fund nor did the board consider any one of them to be determinative with respect to the factors that were relevant the boards decision to approve the contract reflects its determination that federateds performance and actions provided a satisfactory basis to support the decision to continue the existing arrangements annual shareholder report  voting proxies on fund

selection of securities with different maturities expressed by a yield curve showing the relative yield of similar securities with different maturities c the allocation of the funds portfolio among securities of similar issuers referred to as sectors and d the credit quality of portfolio securities which indicates the risk that the securities may default the  total return for the reporting period consisted of  of taxexempt dividends and  of price appreciation in the net asset value of the shares market overview during the month reporting period the pace of recovery in output and employment slowed with tight credit modest income growth and lower housing wealth being major contributors to this economic environment yields on nominal treasury coupon securities fell noticeably during the period and treasury auctions were generally well received the pace of economic recovery was more modest than had been anticipated and inflation remained subdued to help support economic recovery the federal reserve board the “fed” kept constant its holdings of securities at the current levels by reinvesting principal payments from agency debt and mortgage backed securities in longer term treasury securities and rolling over its holdings of treasury debt as it matured the fed maintained the target range for the federal funds rate between  and  during the entire period  duration is a measure of a securitys price sensitivity to changes in interest rates securities with longer durations are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than securities with shorter durations  bond prices are sensitive to changes in interest rates and a rise in interest rates can cause a decline in their prices  income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for individuals or corporations annual shareholder report  the combined fiscal and monetary stimuli drove an impressive rebound in the valuation of risky assets taxexempt municipal credit spreads declined significantly as the spread between  year bbbrated and aaarated taxexempt municipal bonds declined by  basis points during the reporting period this extensive normalization of the taxexempt municipal market from the market disruptions in  resulted from several positive technical factors significant federal financial support programs for state governments were put in place to stimulate local economies and boost confidence the build america bonds bab program reduced the supply of taxexempt municipal bonds issued helping to create a shortage of taxexempt bonds available in the market ongoing strong demand for yield from investors as money market rates remained very low the expectations of higher marginal tax rates and strong mutual fund flows led to solid demand for taxexempt debt these factors helped to create the supply and demand imbalance that has enabled the taxexempt municipal market to recover and provide positive returns during the period during the month reporting period the michigan taxexempt municipal market reflected the national market according to municipal market data yields on michigan bonds fell over the course of the period as the overall yield curve fell and spreads on michigan credits tightened the bond buyer reported that issuance of michigan municipal bonds for the first eight months of  was in line with the same period in  however a significant portion of these were taxable babs resulting in a net decline in the issuance of taxexempt bonds the economic and fiscal situations in michigan remained weak as the state continued to be particularly hard hit by the recession but michigans economy began to improve with the natural economy during the period the state grappled with the fallout of the bankruptcies of gm and chrysler and other large declines in the manufacturing sector the states unemployment rate at the end of july stood at  second only to nevada but with the domestic auto industry starting to regain its footing during the period michigan payrolls began to expand again in  home prices remained weak both the state and local governments have had to confront declining revenues and budget deficits despite the weak economic and fiscal situation in michigan the state saw its rating raised by two of the ratings agencies as a result of recalibrations of their ratings systems in april moodys investors service revised the rating on the states general obligation debt from aa to aa and fitch ratings revised its rating from a to aa sps rating of aa remained unchanged all three ratings carried stable outlooks annual shareholder report  duration as determined at the end of the month reporting period the funds dollarweighted average duration was  years duration management was a significant component of the funds investment strategy the funds duration was maintained short of the duration of the intermediate index during the month reporting period with falling rates the funds relatively short duration had a slight negative impact on the funds performance relative to the intermediate index yield curvematurity throughout the yield curve bonds with longer maturities outperformed bonds with shorter maturities during the reporting period since the fund had a larger concentration of bonds in shorter maturities relative to the intermediate index yield curve positioning was a net detractor to the funds performance sector during the month reporting period the fund was overweight as compared to the intermediate index in hospital and industrial revenue bonds which were among the bestperforming sectors likewise the fund was underweight prerefunded and water and sewer bonds which underperformed thus sector selection was positive contributor to the funds performance versus the intermediate index credit quality the fund maintained a highquality portfolio with over  of the portfolio rated in one of the three highest rating categories aaa aa and a throughout the month reporting period highquality taxexempt municipal bonds underperformed lower quality bonds as spreads tightened on the latter driving their prices down consequently credit quality contributed to the funds underperformance versus the intermediate index  credit ratings pertain only to the securities in the portfolio and do not protect the fund shares against market risk  investmentgrade securities are securities that are rated at least bbb ie in one of the four highest rating categories or unrated securities of a comparable quality noninvestmentgrade securities are securities that are not rated at least bbb or unrated securities of a comparable quality credit ratings are an indication of the risk that a security will default they do not protect a security from credit risk lowerrated bonds typically offer higher yields to help compensate investors for the increased risk associated with them among these risks are lower creditworthiness greater price volatility more risk to principal and income than with higherrated securities and increased possibilities of default annual shareholder report  growth of a  investment  class a shares the graph below illustrates the hypothetical

securities the fund normally uses mid evaluations for other types of fixedincome securities and otc derivative contracts in the event that market quotations and price evaluations are not available for an investment the fair value of the investment is determined in accordance with procedures adopted by the trusteesthe trustees also have adopted procedures requiring an investment to be priced at its fair value whenever the adviser determines that a significant event affecting the value of the investment has occurred between the time as of which the price of the investment would otherwise be determined and the time as of which the nav is computed an event is considered significant if there is both an affirmative expectation that the investments value will change in response to the event

carnegie mellon universityannual shareholder report  evaluation and approval of advisory contract  may  federated michigan intermediate municipal trust the “fund” the funds board reviewed the funds investment advisory contract at meetings held in may  the boards decision regarding the contract reflects the exercise of its business judgment on whether to continue the existing arrangements in this connection the federated funds board had previously appointed a senior officer whose duties include specified responsibilities relating to the process by which advisory fees are to be charged to a federated fund the senior officer has the authority to retain consultants experts or staff as may be reasonably necessary to assist in the performance of his duties reports directly to the board and may be terminated only with the approval of a majority of the independent members of the board the senior officer prepared and furnished to the board an independent written evaluation that covered topics discussed below the board considered that evaluation along with other information in deciding to approve the advisory contract during its review of the contract the board considered compensation and benefits received by the adviser this included the fees received for services provided to the fund by other entities in the federated organization and research services if any received by the adviser from brokers that execute federated fund trades as well as advisory fees the board is also familiar with and considered judicial decisions concerning allegedly excessive investment advisory fees which have indicated that the following factors may be relevant to an advisers fiduciary duty with respect to its receipt of compensation from a fund the nature and quality of the services provided by the adviser including the performance of the fund the advisers cost of providing the services the extent to which the adviser may realize “economies of scale” as a fund grows larger any indirect benefits that may accrue to the adviser and its affiliates as a result of the advisers relationship with a fund performance and expenses of comparable funds and the extent to which the independent board members are fully informed about all facts the board deems relevant bearing on the advisers services and fees the board further considered management fees including any components thereof charged to institutional and other clients of the adviser for what might be viewed as like services and the cost to the adviser and its affiliates of supplying services pursuant to the management fee agreements excluding any intracorporate profit and profit margins of the adviser and its affiliates for supplying such services the board was aware of these factors and was guided by them in its review of the funds advisory contract to the extent it considered them to be appropriate and relevant as discussed further below annual shareholder report  the board considered and weighed these circumstances in light of its substantial accumulated experience in governing the fund and working with federated on matters relating to the federated funds and was assisted in its deliberations by independent legal counsel throughout the year the board has requested and received substantial and detailed information about the fund and the federated organization that was in addition to the extensive materials that comprise and accompany the senior officers evaluation federated provided much of this information at each regular meeting of the board and furnished additional reports in connection with the particular meeting at which the boards formal review of the advisory contract occurred between regularly scheduled meetings the board also received information on particular matters as the need arose thus the boards consideration of the advisory contract included review of the senior officers evaluation accompanying data and additional reports covering such matters as the advisers investment philosophy revenue profitability personnel and processes investment and operating strategies the funds short and longterm performance in absolute terms both on a gross basis and net of expenses as well as in relationship to its particular investment program and certain competitor or “peer group” funds andor other benchmarks as appropriate and comments on the reasons for performance the funds investment objectives the funds expenses including the advisory fee itself and the overall expense structure of the fund both in absolute terms and relative to similar andor competing funds with due regard for contractual or voluntary expense limitations the use and allocation of brokerage commissions derived from trading the funds portfolio securities if any and the nature quality and extent of the advisory and other services provided to the fund by the adviser and its affiliates the board also considered the preferences and expectations of fund shareholders and their relative sophistication the continuing state of competition in the mutual fund industry and market practices the range of comparable fees for similar funds in the mutual fund industry the funds relationship to the federated family of funds which include a comprehensive array of funds with different investment objectives policies and strategies which are available for exchange without the incurrence of additional sales charges compliance and audit reports concerning the federated funds and the federated companies that service them including communications from regulatory agencies as well as federateds responses to any issues raised therein and relevant developments in the mutual fund industry and how the federated funds andor federated are responding to them the boards evaluation process is evolutionary the criteria considered and the emphasis placed on relevant criteria change in recognition of changing circumstances in the mutual fund marketplace with respect to the funds performance and expenses in particular the board has found the use of comparisons to other mutual funds with comparable investment programs to be relevant given the high degree of competition in the mutual fund business the board focused on comparisons with other similar annual shareholder report  mutual funds more heavily than nonmutual fund products or services because it is believed that they are more relevant for example other mutual funds are the products most like the fund they are readily available to fund shareholders as alternative investment vehicles and they are the type of investment vehicle in fact chosen and maintained by the funds investors the range of their fees and expenses therefore appears to be a generally reliable indication of what consumers have found to be reasonable in the precise marketplace in which the fund competes the funds ability to deliver competitive performance when compared to its peer group was a useful indicator of how the adviser is executing the funds investment program which in turn assisted the board in reaching a conclusion that the nature extent and quality of the advisers investment management services were such as to warrant continuation of the advisory contract in this regard the senior officer has reviewed federateds fees for providing advisory services to products outside the federated family of funds eg institutional and separate accounts he concluded that mutual funds and institutional accounts are inherently different products those differences include but are not limited to different types of targeted investors being subject to different laws and regulations different legal structures different average account sizes different associated costs different portfolio management techniques made necessary by different cash flows and portfolio manager time spent in review of securities pricing the senior officer did not consider these fee schedules to be determinative in judging the appropriateness of mutual fund advisory contracts the senior officer reviewed reports compiled by federated using data supplied by independent fund ranking organizations regarding the performance of and fees charged by other mutual funds noting his view that comparisons to fund peer groups are relevant in judging the reasonableness of proposed fees the funds performance fell below the median of the relevant peer group for the oneyear threeyear and fiveyear periods covered by the report the board discussed the funds performance with the adviser and recognized the efforts being undertaken by the adviser the board will continue to monitor these efforts and the performance of the fund the board also received financial information about federated including reports on the compensation and benefits federated derived from its relationships with the federated funds these reports covered not only the fees under the advisory contracts but also fees received by federateds subsidiaries for providing other services to the federated funds under separate contracts eg for serving as the federated funds administrator the reports also discussed any indirect benefit federated may derive from its receipt of research services from brokers who execute federated fund trades in addition the board considered the fact that in order for a fund to be competitive in the marketplace federated and its affiliates frequently waived fees andor annual shareholder report  reimbursed expenses and have disclosed to fund investors andor indicated to the board their intention to do so in the future where appropriate moreover the board receives regular reports regarding the institution or elimination of these voluntary waivers federated furnished reports requested by the senior officer that reported revenues on a fundbyfund basis and made estimates of the allocation of expenses on a fundbyfund basis using allocation methodologies specified by the senior officer the senior officer noted that although they may apply consistent allocation processes the inherent difficulties in allocating costs and the unavoidable arbitrary aspects of that exercise and the lack of consensus on how to allocate those costs may render such allocation reports unreliable the allocation reports were considered in the analysis by the board but were determined to be of limited use the board and the senior officer also reviewed a report compiled by federated comparing profitability information for federated to other publicly held fund management companies in this regard the senior officer noted the limited availability of such information but nonetheless concluded that federateds profit margins did not appear to be excessive and the board agreed the senior officers evaluation also discussed the notion of possible realization of “economies of scale” as a fund grows larger the board considered in this regard that the adviser has made significant and longterm investments in areas that support all of the federated funds such as personnel and processes for the portfolio management compliance and risk management functions and systems technology and that the benefits of these efforts as well as any economies should they exist were likely to be enjoyed by the fund complex as a whole finally the board also noted the absence of any applicable regulatory or industry guidelines on this subject which as discussed in the senior officers evaluation is compounded by the lack of any common industry practice or general pattern with respect to structuring fund advisory fees with “breakpoints” that serve to reduce the fee as the fund attains a certain size the senior officer did not recommend institution of breakpoints in pricing federateds fund advisory services at this time it was noted in the materials for the board meeting that for the period covered by the report the funds investment advisory fee after waivers and expense reimbursements if any was below the median of the relevant peer group the board reviewed the fees and other expenses of the fund with the adviser and was satisfied that the overall expense structure of the fund remained competitive the senior officers evaluation noted his belief that the information and observations contained in his evaluation supported a finding that the proposed management fees are reasonable and that federated appeared to provide appropriate administrative services to the fund for the fees paid under these annual shareholder report  circumstances no changes were recommended to and no objection was raised to the continuation of the funds advisory contract the board concluded that the nature quality and scope of services provided the fund by the adviser and its affiliates were satisfactory in its decision to continue an existing investment advisory contract the board was mindful of the potential disruptions of the funds operations and various risks uncertainties and other effects that could occur as a result of a decision to terminate or not renew an advisory contract in particular the board recognized that many shareholders have invested in the fund on the strength of the advisers industry standing and reputation and with the expectation that the adviser will have a continuing role in providing advisory services to the fund thus the boards approval of the advisory contract reflected the fact that it is the shareholders who have effectively selected the adviser by virtue of having invested in the fund the board based its decision to approve the advisory contract on the totality of the circumstances and relevant factors and with a view to past and future longterm considerations not all of the factors and considerations identified above were necessarily relevant to the fund nor did the board consider any one of them to be determinative with respect to the factors that were relevant the boards decision to approve the contract reflects its determination that federateds performance and actions provided a satisfactory basis to support the decision to continue the existing arrangements annual shareholder report  voting proxies on fund portfolio securities a description of the

for example an  account value divided by    then multiply the result by the number in the first section under the heading entitled “expenses paid during period” to estimate the expenses attributable to your investment during this period hypothetical example for comparison purposes the second section of the table below provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the funds actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of  per year before expenses which is not the funds actual return thus you should not use the hypothetical account values

indicates the portfolios sensitivity to changes in interest rates b the allocation of the funds portfolio among securities of similar issuers referred to as sectors and c the credit rating of portfolio securities which indicates the risk that the securities may default the following discussion will focus on the performance of the funds class a shares the  total return of the class a shares consisted of  of taxexempt dividends and  appreciation in the net asset value of the shares market overview during the month reporting period ended august   the pace of recovery in output and employment slowed with tight credit modest income growth and lower housing wealth being major contributors to this economic environment yields on nominal treasury coupon securities fell noticeably during the period and treasury auctions were generally well received the pace of economic recovery was more modest than had been anticipated and inflation remained subdued to help support economic recovery the federal reserve board the “fed” kept constant its holdings of securities at the current levels by reinvesting principal payments from agency debt and mortgagebacked securities in longer term treasury securities and rolling over its holdings of treasury debt as it matured the fed maintained the target range for the federal funds rate between  and  during the entire period the state of new york continued to have a broad and wealthy economy that continued to attract a highly educated work force the state of new yorks pension system continued to be well funded and it continued to have a wealthy tax base and a long history of raising revenue and adjusting spending to maintain fiscal solvency however the state continued to maintain an above average debt burden relative to other states due in part to significant additional issuance for capital spending needs the states economy has been highly cyclical which reflects its dependence on new york city and the financial services industry the state fiscal situation has also been volatile due to its above average dependence on income taxes and the large recurring expenditure demands from very generous social service programs  duration is a measure of a securitys price sensitivity to changes in interest rates securities with longer durations are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than securities with shorter durations  bond prices are sensitive to changes in interest rates and a rise in interest rates can cause a decline in their prices  income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for individuals and corporations annual shareholder report  the combined fiscal and monetary stimuli drove an impressive rebound in the valuation of risky assets taxexempt municipal credit spreads declined significantly as the spread between  year bbbrated and aaarated taxexempt municipal bonds declined by  basis points during the reporting period this extensive normalization of the taxexempt municipal market from the market disruptions in  resulted from several positive technical factors significant federal financial support programs for state governments were put in place to stimulate local economies and boost confidence the build america bonds program reduced the supply of taxexempt municipal bonds issued helping to create a shortage of taxexempt bonds available in the market ongoing strong demand for yield from investors as money market rates remained very low the expectations of higher marginal tax rates and strong mutual fund flows led to solid demand for taxexempt debt these factors helped to create the supply and demand imbalance that enabled the taxexempt municipal market to recover and provide positive returns during the period the credit fundamentals of the municipal bond market showed continued deterioration in such credit factors as pension funding requirements real estate values and revenue growth duration as determined at the end of the month reporting period the funds dollarweighted average duration was  years duration management continued to be a significant component of the funds investment strategy the shorter a funds duration relative to an index the less its net asset value will react as interest rates change the fund adjusted duration relative to the ny index several times during the reporting period taxexempt municipal bond yields declined significantly during the period as the market stabilized and then recovered from a near crisis environment to one of improved liquidity a near zero federal funds rate and increased investment activity as a result the funds duration overweight  relative to the ny index resulted in a positive contribution to the funds performance sector during the month reporting period relative to the ny index the fund maintained a higher portfolio allocation to securities issued by public utilities and industrial development revenue bonds these allocations helped the funds performance due to the narrowing of credit spreads within these sectors the fund had a higher allocation to prerefunded bonds higher education debt and healthcare than the ny index these sectors underperformed the ny index during the period and detracted from performance overall the fund experienced a negative excess return contribution from its sector allocations annual shareholder report  credit quality riskaversion by investors subsided as the financial markets stabilized and a preference for yield resulted in the outperformance of bonds rated a and bbb and unrated bonds of similar quality relative to bonds rated in the higher rating categories or unrated bonds of similar quality with the decrease in credit spreads during the period and the narrowing of credit spreads to a greater extent for a and bbbrated or comparable quality debt the funds overweight relative to the ny index in bbbrated debt during the reporting period minimally helped the funds performance as the yield on bbbrated debt decreased to a greater extent than for other investmentgrade securities also the funds weighting in bbrated debt relative to ny indexs zero weighting in that rating category detracted from fund performance despite the contraction of credit spreads during the period due to security selection  credit ratings pertain only to the securities in the portfolio and do not protect fund shares against market risk  investmentgrade securities are securities that are rated at least “bbb” or unrated securities of a comparable quality noninvestmentgrade securities are securities that are not rated at least “bbb” or unrated securities of a comparable quality credit ratings are an indication of the risk that a security will default they do not protect a security from credit risk lowerrated bonds typically offer higher yields to help compensate investors for the increased risk associated with them among these risks are lower creditworthiness greater price volatility more risk to principal and income than with higherrated securities and increased possibilities of default annual shareholder report  growth of a  investment  class a shares the graph below illustrates the hypothetical

federal amt for individuals and corporations  significant accounting policies the following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the fund in the preparation of its financial statements these policies are in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap investment valuation in calculating its net asset value nav the fund generally values investments as follows fixedincome securities acquired with remaining maturities greater than  days are fair valued using price evaluations provided by a pricing service approved by the board of trustees the “trustees” fixedincome securities acquired with remaining maturities of  days or less are valued at their cost adjusted for the accretion of any discount or amortization of any premium derivative contracts listed on exchanges are valued at their reported settlement or closing price overthecounter otc derivative contracts are fair valued using price evaluations provided by a pricing service approved by the trustees shares of other mutual funds are valued based upon their reported navs if the fund cannot obtain a price or price evaluation from a pricing service for an investment the fund may attempt to value the investment based upon the mean of bid and asked quotations or fair value the investment based on price evaluations from one or more dealers if any price quotation price evaluation or other pricing source is not readily available when the nav is calculated the fund uses the fair value of the investment determined in accordance with the procedures described below there can be no assurance that the fund could purchase or sell an investment at the price used to calculate the funds nav fair valuation and significant events procedures the trustees have authorized the use of pricing services to provide evaluations of the current fair value of certain investments for purposes of calculating the nav factors considered by pricing services in evaluating an investment include the yields or prices of investments of comparable quality coupon maturity call rights and other potential prepayments terms and type reported transactions indications as to values from dealers and general market annual shareholder report  conditions some pricing services provide a single price evaluation reflecting the bidside of the market for an investment a “bid” evaluation other pricing services offer both bid evaluations and price evaluations indicative of a price between the prices bid and asked for the investment a “mid” evaluation the fund normally uses bid evaluations for us treasury and agency securities mortgagebacked securities and municipal securities the fund normally uses mid evaluations for other types of fixedincome securities and otc derivative contracts in the event that market quotations and price evaluations are not available for an investment the fair value of the investment is determined in accordance with procedures adopted by the trustees the trustees also have adopted procedures requiring an investment to be priced at its fair value whenever the adviser determines that a significant event affecting the value of the investment has occurred between the time as of which the price of the investment would otherwise be determined and the time as of which the nav is computed an event is considered significant if there is both an affirmative expectation that the investments value will change in response to the event and a reasonable basis for quantifying the resulting change in value examples of significant events that may occur after the close of the principal market on which a security is traded or after the time of a price evaluation provided by a pricing service or a dealer include with respect to price evaluations of fixedincome securities determined before the close of regular trading on the nyse actions by the federal reserve open market committee and other significant trends in us fixedincome markets political or other developments affecting the economy or markets in which an issuer conducts its operations or its securities are traded and announcements concerning matters such as acquisitions recapitalizations litigation developments a natural disaster affecting the issuers operations or regulatory changes or market developments affecting the issuers industry the fund may seek to obtain more current quotations or price evaluations from alternative pricing sources if a reliable alternative pricing source is not available the fund will determine the fair value of the investment using another method approved by the trustees investment income gains and losses expenses and distributions investment transactions are accounted for on a tradedate basis realized gains and losses from investment transactions are recorded on an identifiedcost basis interest income and expenses are accrued daily distributions to shareholders are recorded on the exdividend date distributions of net investment income are declared daily and paid monthly noncash dividends included in dividend income if any are recorded at fair value investment income realized and unrealized gains and losses and certain fundlevel expenses are allocated to each class based on relative average daily net assets except that each class may bear certain expenses unique to that class such as distribution services shareholder services and account administration fees dividends are declared separately for each class no class has preferential dividend rights differences in per share dividend rates are generally due to differences in separate class expenses premium and discount amortization all premiums and discounts on fixedincome securities are amortizedaccreted for financial statement purposes annual

in alleging that federated engaged in illegal and improper trading practices including market timing and late trading in concert with certain institutional traders which allegedly caused financial injury to the mutual fund shareholders federated without admitting the validity of any claim has reached a preliminary settlement with the plaintiffs in these cases any settlement would have to be

income fund the “fund” the funds board reviewed the funds investment advisory contract at meetings held in may  the boards decision regarding the contract reflects the exercise of its business judgment on whether to continue the existing arrangements in this connection the federated funds board had previously appointed a senior officer whose duties include specified responsibilities relating to the process by which advisory fees are to be charged to a federated fund the senior officer has the authority to retain consultants experts or staff as may be reasonably necessary to assist in the performance of his duties reports directly to the board and may be terminated only with the approval of a majority of the independent members of the board the senior officer prepared and furnished to the board an independent written evaluation that covered topics discussed below the board considered that evaluation along with other information in deciding to approve the advisory contract during its review of the contract the board considered compensation and benefits received by the adviser this included the fees received for services provided to the fund by other entities in the federated organization and research services if any received by the adviser from brokers that execute federated fund trades as well as advisory fees the board is also familiar with and considered judicial decisions concerning allegedly excessive investment advisory fees which have indicated that the following factors may be relevant to an advisers fiduciary duty with respect to its receipt of compensation from a fund the nature and quality of the services provided by the adviser including the performance of the fund the advisers cost of providing the services the extent to which the adviser may realize “economies of scale” as a fund grows larger any indirect benefits that may accrue to the adviser and its affiliates as a result of the advisers relationship with a fund performance and expenses of comparable funds and the extent to which the independent board members are fully informed about all facts the board deems relevant bearing on the advisers services and fees the board further considered management fees including any components thereof charged to institutional and other clients of the adviser for what might be viewed as like services and the cost to the adviser and its affiliates of supplying services pursuant to the management fee agreements excluding any intracorporate profit and profit margins of the adviser and its affiliates for supplying such services the board was aware of these factors and was guided by them in its review of the funds advisory contract to the extent it considered them to be appropriate and relevant as discussed further below annual shareholder report  the board considered and weighed these circumstances in light of its substantial accumulated experience in governing the fund and working with federated on matters relating to the federated funds and was assisted in its deliberations by independent legal counsel throughout the year the board has requested and received substantial and detailed information about the fund and the federated organization that was in addition to the extensive materials that comprise and accompany the senior officers evaluation federated provided much of this information at each regular meeting of the board and furnished additional reports in connection with the particular meeting at which the boards formal review of the advisory contract occurred between regularly scheduled meetings the board also received information on particular matters as the need arose thus the boards consideration of the advisory contract included review of the senior officers evaluation accompanying data and additional reports covering such matters as the advisers investment philosophy revenue profitability personnel and processes investment and operating strategies the funds short and longterm performance in absolute terms both on a gross basis and net of expenses as well as in relationship to its particular investment program and certain competitor or “peer group” funds andor other benchmarks as appropriate and comments on the reasons for performance the funds investment objectives the funds expenses including the advisory fee itself and the overall expense structure of the fund both in absolute terms and relative to similar andor competing funds with due regard for contractual or voluntary expense limitations the use and allocation of brokerage commissions derived from trading the funds portfolio securities if any and the nature quality and extent of the advisory and other services provided to the fund by the adviser and its affiliates the board also considered the preferences and expectations of fund shareholders and their relative sophistication the continuing state of competition in the mutual fund industry and market practices the range of comparable fees for similar funds in the mutual fund industry the funds relationship to the federated family of funds which include a comprehensive array of funds with different investment objectives policies and strategies which are available for exchange without the incurrence of additional sales charges compliance and audit reports concerning the federated funds and the federated companies that service them including communications from regulatory agencies as well as federateds responses to any issues raised therein and relevant developments in the mutual fund industry and how the federated funds andor federated are responding to them the boards evaluation process is evolutionary the criteria considered and the emphasis placed on relevant criteria change in recognition of changing circumstances in the mutual fund marketplace with respect to the funds performance and expenses in particular the board has found the use of comparisons to other mutual funds with comparable investment programs to be relevant given the high degree of competition in the mutual fund business the board focused on comparisons with other similar annual shareholder report  mutual funds more heavily than nonmutual fund products or services because it is believed that they are more relevant for example other mutual funds are the products most like the fund they are readily available to fund shareholders as alternative investment vehicles and they are the type of investment vehicle in fact chosen and maintained by the funds investors the range of their fees and expenses therefore appears to be a generally reliable indication of what consumers have found to be reasonable in the precise marketplace in which the fund competes the funds ability to deliver competitive performance when compared to its peer group was a useful indicator of how the adviser is executing the funds investment program which in turn assisted the board in reaching a conclusion that the nature extent and quality of the advisers investment management services were such as to warrant continuation of the advisory contract in this regard the senior officer has reviewed federateds fees for providing advisory services to products outside the federated family of funds eg institutional and separate accounts he concluded that mutual funds and institutional accounts are inherently different products those differences include but are not limited to different types of targeted investors being subject to different laws and regulations different legal structures different average account sizes different associated costs different portfolio management techniques made necessary by different cash flows and portfolio manager time spent in review of securities pricing the senior officer did not consider these fee schedules to be determinative in judging the appropriateness of mutual fund advisory contracts the senior officer reviewed reports compiled by federated using data supplied by independent fund ranking organizations regarding the performance of and fees charged by other mutual funds noting his view that comparisons to fund peer groups are relevant in judging the reasonableness of proposed fees for the periods covered by the report the funds performance for the oneyear period was above the median of the relevant peer group and the funds performance fell below the median of the relevant peer group for the threeyear and fiveyear periods the board discussed the funds performance with the adviser and recognized the efforts being undertaken by the adviser the board will continue to monitor these efforts and the performance of the fund the board also received financial information about federated including reports on the compensation and benefits federated derived from its relationships with the federated funds these reports covered not only the fees under the advisory contracts but also fees received by federateds subsidiaries for providing other services to the federated funds under separate contracts eg for serving as the federated funds administrator the reports also discussed any indirect benefit federated may derive from its receipt of research services from brokers who execute federated fund trades in addition the board considered the fact that in order for a fund to be competitive in the marketplace federated and its affiliates frequently waived fees andor annual shareholder report  reimbursed expenses and have disclosed to fund investors andor indicated to the board their intention to do so in the future where appropriate moreover the board receives regular reports regarding the institution or elimination of these voluntary waivers federated furnished reports requested by the senior officer that reported revenues on a fundbyfund basis and made estimates of the allocation of expenses on a fundbyfund basis using allocation methodologies specified by the senior officer the senior officer noted that although they may apply consistent allocation processes the inherent difficulties in allocating costs and the unavoidable arbitrary aspects of that exercise and the lack of consensus on how to allocate those costs may render such allocation reports unreliable the allocation reports were considered in the analysis by the board but were determined to be of limited use the board and the senior officer also reviewed a report compiled by federated comparing profitability information for federated to other publicly held fund management companies in this regard the senior officer noted the limited availability of such information but nonetheless concluded that federateds profit margins did not appear to be excessive and the board agreed the senior officers evaluation also discussed the notion of possible realization of “economies of scale” as a fund grows larger the board considered in this regard that the adviser has made significant and longterm investments in areas that support all of the federated funds such as personnel and processes for the portfolio management compliance and risk management functions and systems technology and that the benefits of these efforts as well as any economies should they exist were likely to be enjoyed by the fund complex as a whole finally the board also noted the absence of any applicable regulatory or industry guidelines on this subject which as discussed in the senior officers evaluation is compounded by the lack of any common industry practice or general pattern with respect to structuring fund advisory fees with “breakpoints” that serve to reduce the fee as the fund attains a certain size the senior officer did not recommend institution of breakpoints in pricing federateds fund advisory services at this time it was noted in the materials for the board meeting that for the period covered by the report the funds investment advisory fee was waived in its entirety the board reviewed the contractual fee rate and other expenses of the fund with the adviser and was satisfied that the overall expense structure of the fund remained competitive the senior officers evaluation noted his belief that the information and observations contained in his evaluation supported a finding that the proposed management fees are reasonable and that federated appeared to provide appropriate administrative services to the fund for the fees paid under these annual shareholder report  circumstances no changes were recommended to and no objection was raised to the continuation of the funds advisory contract the board concluded that the nature quality and scope of services provided the fund by the adviser and its affiliates were satisfactory in its decision to continue an existing investment advisory contract the board was mindful of the potential disruptions of the funds operations and various risks uncertainties and other effects that could occur as a result of a decision to terminate or not renew an advisory contract in particular the board recognized that many shareholders have invested in the fund on the strength of the advisers industry standing and reputation and with the expectation that the adviser will have a continuing role in providing advisory services to the fund thus the boards approval of the advisory contract reflected the fact that it is the shareholders who have effectively selected the adviser by virtue of having invested in the fund the board based its decision to approve the advisory contract on the totality of the circumstances and relevant factors and with a view to past and future longterm considerations not all of the factors and considerations identified above were necessarily relevant to the fund nor did the board consider any one of them to be determinative with respect to the factors that were relevant the boards decision to approve the contract reflects its determination that federateds performance and actions provided a satisfactory basis to support the decision to continue the existing arrangements

incurred over the period simply divide your account value by  for example an  account value divided by    then multiply the result by the number in the first section under the heading entitled “expenses paid during period” to estimate the expenses attributable to your investment during this period hypothetical example for comparison purposes the second section of the table below provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the funds actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of  per year before expenses which is not the funds actual return thus you should not use the hypothetical account values and expenses to estimate the actual ending account balance or your expenses for the period rather these figures are required to be

securities with shorter durations for purposes of this managements discussion of fund performance duration is determined using a thirdparty analytical system  bond prices are sensitive to changes in interest rates and a rise in interest rates can cause a decline in their prices annual shareholder report  the following discussion focuses on the performance of the funds class a shares the  total return of the class a shares for the reporting period consisted of  of taxexempt dividends and reinvestments and  of price appreciation in the net asset value of the shares market overview during the month reporting period the pace of recovery in output and employment slowed with tight credit modest income growth and lower housing wealth being major contributors to the economic environment yields on nominal treasury coupon securities fell noticeably during the period and treasury auctions were generally well received the pace of economic recovery was more modest in the near term than had been anticipated and inflation remained subdued to help support economic recovery the federal reserve board the ”fed” kept constant its holdings of securities at the current levels by reinvesting principal payments from agency debt and mortgagebacked securities in longerterm treasury securities and rolling over its holdings of treasury debt as it matured the fed maintained the target range for the federal funds rate between  and  during the entire period the state of ohio has a history of strong financial management that spanning several decades has been tested by economic underperformance relative to the rest of the country the state has addressed budget shortfalls promptly and has made an effort to build financial reserves however ohios economy remained weak due to its heavy reliance on the manufacturing industry and relied on federal stimulus funding and other nonrecurring measures to balance its fiscal operations the deterioration in manufacturing employment impacted the states already weak demographics as unemployed workers migrated to other states ohio maintained a moderate debt burden relative to other states but had significant erosion in the funded portion of its public employees pension liabilities the combined fiscal and monetary stimuli drove an impressive rebound in the valuation of risky assets taxexempt municipal credit spreads declined significantly as the spread between year bbbrated and aaarated taxexempt municipal bonds declined by  basis points during the reporting period this extensive normalization of the taxexempt municipal market from the market disruptions in  resulted from several positive technical factors significant federal financial support programs for state governments were put in place to stimulate local economies and boost confidence the build america bonds program reduced the supply of taxexempt municipal bonds issued helping to create a shortage of taxexempt bonds available in the market ongoing strong demand for yield from investors as money market rates remained very low the expectations of higher marginal tax rates and strong mutual fund flows led to solid demand for taxexempt debt these factors helped to create the supply and demand imbalance that has enabled the taxexempt municipal market to recover and provide positive returns during the period  income may be subject to the alternative minimum tax for individuals and corporations amt annual shareholder report  the credit fundamentals of the taxexempt municipal bond market have shown continued deterioration in such credit factors as pension funding requirements real estate values and revenue growth duration as determined at the end of the month reporting period the funds dollarweighted average duration was  years duration management continued to be a significant component of the funds investment strategy the shorter a funds duration relative to an index the less its net asset value will react as interest rates change the funds duration was consistently shorter than the oh index during the reporting period taxexempt municipal bond yields declined significantly during the period as the market stabilized and then recovered from a near crisis environment to one of improved liquidity a near zero federal funds target rate and increased investment activity as a result the funds duration underweight  relative to the oh index detracted from fund performance sector during the month reporting period relative to the oh index the fund maintained a higher portfolio allocation to securities issued by single and multifamily housing issuers public power authorities and life care providers these allocations helped the funds performance due to the narrowing of credit spreads within these sectors the fund also had a lesser allocation compared to the oh index to tobaccorelated debt which underperformed during the period and had a large positive contribution to performance the fund maintained an underweight in hospitals relative to the oh index this sector outperformed the oh index during the period and detracted from performance the fund gained positive excess return from its sector selection during the period credit quality riskaversion by investors subsided as the financial markets stabilized and a preference for yield resulted in the outperformance of bonds rated a and bbb and unrated bonds of similar quality relative to bonds rated in the higher rating categories or unrated bonds of similar quality with the decrease in credit spreads during the period and the narrowing of credit spreads to a greater extent for a and bbbrated or comparable quality debt the funds overweight relative to the oh index in a and bbbrated debt during the reporting period helped the funds performance as the yield on a and bbbrated debt decreased to a greater extent than for other investmentgrade securities  credit ratings pertain only to the securities in the portfolio and do not protect fund shares against market risk investmentgrade securities are securities that are rated at least “bbb” or unrated securities of a comparable quality noninvestmentgrade securities are securities that are not rated at

event affecting the value of the investment has occurred between the time as of which the price of the investment would otherwise be determined and the time as of which the nav is computed an event is considered significant if there is both an affirmative expectation that the investments value will change in response to the event and a reasonable basis for quantifying the resulting change in value

municipal income fund the “fund” the funds board reviewed the funds investment advisory contract at meetings held in may  the boards decision regarding the contract reflects the exercise of its business judgment on whether to continue the existing arrangements in this connection the federated funds board had previously appointed a senior officer whose duties include specified responsibilities relating to the process by which advisory fees are to be charged to a federated fund the senior officer has the authority to retain consultants experts or staff as may be reasonably necessary to assist in the performance of his duties reports directly to the board and may be terminated only with the approval of a majority of the independent members of the board the senior officer prepared and furnished to the board an independent written evaluation that covered topics discussed below the board considered that evaluation along with other information in deciding to approve the advisory contract during its review of the contract the board considered compensation and benefits received by the adviser this included the fees received for services provided to the fund by other entities in the federated organization and research services if any received by the adviser from brokers that execute federated fund trades as well as advisory fees the board is also familiar with and considered judicial decisions concerning allegedly excessive investment advisory fees which have indicated that the following factors may be relevant to an advisers fiduciary duty with respect to its receipt of compensation from a fund the nature and quality of the services provided by the adviser including the performance of the fund the advisers cost of providing the services the extent to which the adviser may realize “economies of scale” as a fund grows larger any indirect benefits that may accrue to the adviser and its affiliates as a result of the advisers relationship with a fund performance and expenses of comparable funds and the extent to which the independent board members are fully informed about all facts the board deems relevant bearing on the advisers services and fees the board further considered management fees including any components thereof charged to institutional and other clients of the adviser for what might be viewed as like services and the cost to the adviser and its affiliates of supplying services pursuant to the management fee agreements excluding any intracorporate profit and profit margins of the adviser and its affiliates for supplying such services the board was aware of these factors and was guided by them in its review of the funds advisory contract to the extent it considered them to be appropriate and relevant as discussed further below annual shareholder report  the board considered and weighed these circumstances in light of its substantial accumulated experience in governing the fund and working with federated on matters relating to the federated funds and was assisted in its deliberations by independent legal counsel throughout the year the board has requested and received substantial and detailed information about the fund and the federated organization that was in addition to the extensive materials that comprise and accompany the senior officers evaluation federated provided much of this information at each regular meeting of the board and furnished additional reports in connection with the particular meeting at which the boards formal review of the advisory contract occurred between regularly scheduled meetings the board also received information on particular matters as the need arose thus the boards consideration of the advisory contract included review of the senior officers evaluation accompanying data and additional reports covering such matters as the advisers investment philosophy revenue profitability personnel and processes investment and operating strategies the funds short and longterm performance in absolute terms both on a gross basis and net of expenses as well as in relationship to its particular investment program and certain competitor or “peer group” funds andor other benchmarks as appropriate and comments on the reasons for performance the funds investment objectives the funds expenses including the advisory fee itself and the overall expense structure of the fund both in absolute terms and relative to similar andor competing funds with due regard for contractual or voluntary expense limitations the use and allocation of brokerage commissions derived from trading the funds portfolio securities if any and the nature quality and extent of the advisory and other services provided to the fund by the adviser and its affiliates the board also considered the preferences and expectations of fund shareholders and their relative sophistication the continuing state of competition in the mutual fund industry and market practices the range of comparable fees for similar funds in the mutual fund industry the funds relationship to the federated family of funds which include a comprehensive array of funds with different investment objectives policies and strategies which are available for exchange without the incurrence of additional sales charges compliance and audit reports concerning the federated funds and the federated companies that service them including communications from regulatory agencies as well as federateds responses to any issues raised therein and relevant developments in the mutual fund industry and how the federated funds andor federated are responding to them the boards evaluation process is evolutionary the criteria considered and the emphasis placed on relevant criteria change in recognition of changing circumstances in the mutual fund marketplace with respect to the funds performance and expenses in particular the board has found the use of comparisons to other mutual funds with comparable investment programs to be relevant given the high degree of competition in the mutual fund business the board focused on comparisons with other similar annual shareholder report  mutual funds more heavily than nonmutual fund products or services because it is believed that they are more relevant for example other mutual funds are the products most like the fund they are readily available to fund shareholders as alternative investment vehicles and they are the type of investment vehicle in fact chosen and maintained by the funds investors the range of their fees and expenses therefore appears to be a generally reliable indication of what consumers have found to be reasonable in the precise marketplace in which the fund competes the funds ability to deliver competitive performance when compared to its peer group was a useful indicator of how the adviser is executing the funds investment program which in turn assisted the board in reaching a conclusion that the nature extent and quality of the advisers investment management services were such as to warrant continuation of the advisory contract in this regard the senior officer has reviewed federateds fees for providing advisory services to products outside the federated family of funds eg institutional and separate accounts he concluded that mutual funds and institutional accounts are inherently different products those differences include but are not limited to different types of targeted investors being subject to different laws and regulations different legal structures different average account sizes different associated costs different portfolio management techniques made necessary by different cash flows and portfolio manager time spent in review of securities pricing the senior officer did not consider these fee schedules to be determinative in judging the appropriateness of mutual fund advisory contracts the senior officer reviewed reports compiled by federated using data supplied by independent fund ranking organizations regarding the performance of and fees charged by other mutual funds noting his view that comparisons to fund peer groups are relevant in judging the reasonableness of proposed fees the funds performance fell below the median of the relevant peer group for the oneyear threeyear and fiveyear periods covered by the report the board discussed the funds performance with the adviser and recognized the efforts being undertaken by the adviser the board will continue to monitor these efforts and the performance of the fund the board also received financial information about federated including reports on the compensation and benefits federated derived from its relationships with the federated funds these reports covered not only the fees under the advisory contracts but also fees received by federateds subsidiaries for providing other services to the federated funds under separate contracts eg for serving as the federated funds administrator the reports also discussed any indirect benefit federated may derive from its receipt of research services from brokers who execute federated fund trades in addition the board considered the fact that in order for a fund to be competitive in the marketplace federated and its affiliates frequently waived fees andor annual shareholder report  reimbursed expenses and have disclosed to fund investors andor indicated to the board their intention to do so in the future where appropriate moreover the board receives regular reports regarding the institution or elimination of these voluntary waivers federated furnished reports requested by the senior officer that reported revenues on a fundbyfund basis and made estimates of the allocation of expenses on a fundbyfund basis using allocation methodologies specified by the senior officer the senior officer noted that although they may apply consistent allocation processes the inherent difficulties in allocating costs and the unavoidable arbitrary aspects of that exercise and the lack of consensus on how to allocate those costs may render such allocation reports unreliable the allocation reports were considered in the analysis by the board but were determined to be of limited use the board and the senior officer also reviewed a report compiled by federated comparing profitability information for federated to other publicly held fund management companies in this regard the senior officer noted the limited availability of such information but nonetheless concluded that federateds profit margins did not appear to be excessive and the board agreed the senior officers evaluation also discussed the notion of possible realization of “economies of scale” as a fund grows larger the board considered in this regard that the adviser has made significant and longterm investments in areas that support all of the federated funds such as personnel and processes for the portfolio management compliance and risk management functions and systems technology and that the benefits of these efforts as well as any economies should they exist were likely to be enjoyed by the fund complex as a whole finally the board also noted the absence of any applicable regulatory or industry guidelines on this subject which as discussed in the senior officers evaluation is compounded by the lack of any common industry practice or general pattern with respect to structuring fund advisory fees with “breakpoints” that serve to reduce the fee as the fund attains a certain size the senior officer did not recommend institution of breakpoints in pricing federateds fund advisory services at this time it was noted in the materials for the board meeting that for the period covered by the report the funds investment advisory fee after waivers and expense reimbursements if any was below the median of the relevant peer group the board reviewed the fees and other expenses of the fund with the adviser and was satisfied that the overall expense structure of the fund remained competitive the senior officers evaluation noted his belief that the information and observations contained in his evaluation supported a finding that the proposed management fees are reasonable and that federated appeared to provide appropriate administrative services to the fund for the fees paid under these annual shareholder report  circumstances no changes were recommended to and no objection was raised to the continuation of the funds advisory contract the board concluded that the nature quality and scope of services provided the fund by the adviser and its affiliates were satisfactory in its decision to continue an existing investment advisory contract the board was mindful of the potential disruptions of the funds operations and various risks uncertainties and other effects that could occur as a result of a decision to terminate or not renew an advisory contract in particular the board recognized that many shareholders have invested in the fund on the strength of the advisers industry standing and reputation and with the expectation that the adviser will have a continuing role in providing advisory services to the fund thus the boards approval of the advisory contract reflected the fact that it is the shareholders who have effectively selected the adviser by virtue of having invested in the fund the board based its decision to approve the advisory contract on the totality of the circumstances and relevant factors and with a view to past and future longterm considerations not all of

transaction costs including sales charges loads on purchase or redemption payments and  ongoing costs including management fees and to the extent applicable distribution b fees andor shareholder services fees and other fund expenses this example is intended to help you to understand your ongoing costs in dollars of investing in the fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds it is based on an investment of  invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire period from march   to august   actual expenses the first section of the table below provides information about actual account values and actual expenses you may use the information in this section together with the amount you invested to estimate the expenses that you incurred over the period simply divide your account value by  for example an  account value divided by    then multiply the result by the number in the first section under the heading entitled “expenses paid during period” to estimate the expenses attributable to your investment during this period hypothetical example for comparison purposes the second section of the table below provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the funds actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of  per year before expenses which is not the funds actual return thus you should not use the hypothetical account values and expenses to estimate the actual ending account balance or your expenses for the period rather these figures are required to be provided to enable you to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the fund with other funds to do so compare this  hypothetical example with the  hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds annual shareholder report  please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transaction costs such as sales charges loads on purchase or redemption payments therefore the second section of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only and will not help you determine the relative total costs of

bcpamb are adjusted to reflect sales charges expenses and other fees that the securities and exchange commission sec requires to be reflected in the funds performance it is not possible to invest directly in an index annual shareholder report  during the reporting period the most significant factors affecting the funds performance relative to the pa index were a the effective duration of its portfolio which indicates the portfolios sensitivity to changes in interest rates b the allocation of the funds portfolio among securities of similar issuers referred to as sectors and c the credit rating of portfolio securities the following discussion focuses on the performance of the funds class a shares the  total return of the class a shares for the reporting period consisted of  of taxexempt dividends and reinvestments and  of price appreciation in the net asset value of the shares market overview during the month reporting period the pace of recovery in output and employment slowed with tight credit modest income growth and lower housing wealth being major contributors to the economic environment yields on nominal treasury coupon securities fell noticeably during the period and treasury auctions were generally well received the pace of economic recovery was more modest than had been anticipated and inflation remained subdued to help support economic recovery the federal reserve board the “fed” kept constant its holdings of securities at the current levels by reinvesting principal payments from agency debt and mortgagebacked securities in longer term treasury securities and rolling over its holdings of treasury debt as it matured the fed maintained the target range for the federal funds rate between  and  during the entire period the commonwealth of pennsylvania continued to have one of the oldest populations in the us with a median age of  years three years above the national median level the commonwealth continued to maintain a moderate debt burden and a diversifying economy but continued to have weak revenue growth the commonwealth continued to draw upon its sizable reserves amid measures to maintain budget balance the pennsylvania economy continued to diversify away from manufacturing strong employment in education and health services continued to be a stabilizing factor the pension system has historically been well funded  duration is a measure of a securitys price sensitivity to changes in interest rates securities with longer durations are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than securities with shorter durations for purposes of this managements discussion of fund performance duration is determined using a thirdparty analytical system  bond prices are sensitive to changes in interest rates and a rise in interest rates can cause a decline in their prices  income may be subject to the amt for individuals and corporations annual shareholder report  the combined fiscal and monetary stimuli drove an impressive rebound in the valuation of risky assets taxexempt municipal credit spreads declined significantly as the spread between  year bbbrated and aaarated taxexempt municipal bonds declined by  basis points during the reporting period this extensive normalization of the taxexempt municipal market from the market disruptions in  resulted from several positive technical factors significant federal financial support programs for state governments were put in place to stimulate local economies and boost confidence the build america bonds program reduced the supply of taxexempt municipal bonds issued helping to create a shortage of taxexempt bonds available in the market ongoing strong demand for yield from investors as money market rates remained very low the expectations of higher marginal tax rates and strong mutual fund flows led to solid demand for taxexempt debt these factors helped to create the supply and demand imbalance that has enabled the taxexempt municipal market to recover and provide positive returns during the period the credit fundamentals of the taxexempt municipal bond market have shown continued deterioration in such credit factors as pension funding requirements real estate values and revenue growth duration as determined at the end of the month reporting period the funds dollarweighted average duration for the reporting period was  years duration management was a significant component of the funds investment strategy the shorter a funds duration relative to an index the less its net asset value will react as interest rates change the fund adjusted duration relative to the pa index several times during the reporting period taxexempt municipal bond yields declined significantly during the period as the market stabilized and then recovered from a near crisis environment to one of improved liquidity a near zero federal funds rate and increased investment activity as a result the funds duration underweight  relative to the pa index detracted from fund performance sector during the month reporting period the fund maintained a higher portfolio allocation to securities issued by multifamily housing issuers public power authorities and life care providers these allocations helped the funds performance due to the narrowing of credit spreads within these sectors the fund also had less of an allocation to industrial development debt and hospitals than the pa index these sectors outperformed the pa index during the period and detracted from performance annual shareholder report  credit quality riskaversion by investors subsided as the financial markets stabilized and a preference for yield resulted in the outperformance of bonds rated a and bbb and unrated bonds of similar quality relative to bonds rated in the higher rating categories or unrated bonds of similar quality with the decrease in credit spreads during the period and the narrowing of credit spreads to a greater extent for a and bbbrated or comparable quality debt the funds overweight relative to the pa index in bbbrated debt during the reporting period helped the funds performance as the yield on bbbrated debt decreased to a greater extent than for other investmentgrade securities also the funds weighting in bbrated debt relative to the pa indexs zero weighting in that rating category resulted in a positive contribution to fund performance for the same reasons  credit ratings pertain only to the securities in the portfolio and do not protect fund shares against market risk  investmentgrade securities are securities that are rated at least “bbb” or unrated securities of a comparable quality noninvestmentgrade securities are securities that are not rated at least “bbb” or unrated securities of a comparable quality credit ratings are an indication of the risk that a security will default they do not protect a security from credit risk lowerrated bonds typically offer higher yields to help compensate investors for the

valued using price evaluations provided by a pricing service approved by the trusteesfixedincome securities acquired with remaining maturities of  days or less are valued at their cost adjusted for the accretion of any discount or amortization of any premiumderivative contracts listed on exchanges are valued at their reported settlement or closing priceoverthecounter otc derivative contracts are fair valued using price evaluations provided by a pricing service approved by the trusteesshares of other mutual funds are valued based upon their reported navsannual shareholder report  if the fund cannot obtain a price or price evaluation from a pricing service for an investment the fund may attempt to value the investment based upon the mean of bid and asked quotations or fair value the investment based on price evaluations from one or more dealers if any price quotation price evaluation or other pricing source is not readily available when the nav is calculated the fund uses the fair value of the investment determined in accordance with the procedures described below there can be no assurance that the fund could purchase or sell an investment at the price used to calculate the funds navfair valuation and significant events proceduresthe trustees have authorized the use of pricing services to provide evaluations of the current fair value of certain investments for purposes of calculating the nav factors considered by pricing services in evaluating an investment include the yields or prices of investments of comparable quality coupon maturity call rights and other potential prepayments terms and type reported transactions indications as to values from dealers and general market conditions some pricing services provide a single price evaluation reflecting the bidside of the market for an investment a “bid” evaluation other pricing services offer both bid evaluations and price evaluations indicative of a price between the prices bid and asked for the investment a “mid” evaluation the fund normally uses bid evaluations for us treasury and agency securities mortgagebacked securities and municipal securities the fund normally uses mid evaluations for other types of fixedincome securities and otc derivative contracts in the event that market quotations and price evaluations are not available for an investment the fair value of the investment is determined in accordance with procedures adopted by the trusteesthe trustees also have adopted procedures requiring an investment to be priced at its fair value whenever the adviser determines that a significant event affecting the value of the investment has occurred between the time as of which the price of the investment would otherwise be determined and the time as of which the nav is computed an event is considered significant if there is both an affirmative expectation that the investments value will change in response to the event and a reasonable basis for quantifying the resulting change in value examples of significant events that may occur after the close of the principal market on which a security is traded or after the time of a price evaluation provided by a pricing service or a dealer includewith respect to price evaluations of fixedincome securities determined before the close of regular trading on the nyse actions by the federal reserve open market committee

public management from carnegie mellon universityannual shareholder report  evaluation and approval of advisory contract  may  federated pennsylvania municipal income fund the “fund” the funds board reviewed the funds investment advisory contract at meetings held in may  the boards decision regarding the contract reflects the exercise of its business judgment on whether to continue the existing arrangements in this connection the federated funds board had previously appointed a senior officer whose duties include specified responsibilities relating to the process by which advisory fees are to be charged to a federated fund the senior officer has the authority to retain consultants experts or staff as may be reasonably necessary to assist in the performance of his duties reports directly to the board and may be terminated only with the approval of a majority of the independent members of the board the senior officer prepared and furnished to the board an independent written evaluation that covered topics discussed below the board considered that evaluation along with other information in deciding to approve the advisory contract during its review of the contract the board considered compensation and benefits received by the adviser this included the fees received for services provided to the fund by other entities in the federated organization and research services if any received by the adviser from brokers that execute federated fund trades as well as advisory fees the board is also familiar with and considered judicial decisions concerning allegedly excessive investment advisory fees which have indicated that the following factors may be relevant to an advisers fiduciary duty with respect to its receipt of compensation from a fund the nature and quality of the services provided by the adviser including the performance of the fund the advisers cost of providing the services the extent to which the adviser may realize “economies of scale” as a fund grows larger any indirect benefits that may accrue to the adviser and its affiliates as a result of the advisers relationship with a fund performance and expenses of comparable funds and the extent to which the independent board members are fully informed about all facts the board deems relevant bearing on the advisers services and fees the board further considered management fees including any components thereof charged to institutional and other clients of the adviser for what might be viewed as like services and the cost to the adviser and its affiliates of supplying services pursuant to the management fee agreements excluding any intracorporate profit and profit margins of the adviser and its affiliates for supplying such services the board was aware of these factors and was guided by them in its review of the funds advisory contract to the extent it considered them to be appropriate and relevant as discussed further below annual shareholder report  the board considered and weighed these circumstances in light of its substantial accumulated experience in governing the fund and working with federated on matters relating to the federated funds and was assisted in its deliberations by independent legal counsel throughout the year the board has requested and received substantial and detailed information about the fund and the federated organization that was in addition to the extensive materials that comprise and accompany the senior officers evaluation federated provided much of this information at each regular meeting of the board and furnished additional reports in connection with the particular meeting at which the boards formal review of the advisory contract occurred between regularly scheduled meetings the board also received information on particular matters as the need arose thus the boards consideration of the advisory contract included review of the senior officers evaluation accompanying data and additional reports covering such matters as the advisers investment philosophy revenue profitability personnel and processes investment and operating strategies the funds short and longterm performance in absolute terms both on a gross basis and net of expenses as well as in relationship to its particular investment program and certain competitor or “peer group” funds andor other benchmarks as appropriate and comments on the reasons for performance the funds investment objectives the funds expenses including the advisory fee itself and the overall expense structure of the fund both in absolute terms and relative to similar andor competing funds with due regard for contractual or voluntary expense limitations the use and allocation of brokerage commissions derived from trading the funds portfolio securities if any and the nature quality and extent of the advisory and other services provided to the fund by the adviser and its affiliates the board also considered the preferences and expectations of fund shareholders and their relative sophistication the continuing state of competition in the mutual fund industry and market practices the range of comparable fees for similar funds in the mutual fund industry the funds relationship to the federated family of funds which include a comprehensive array of funds with different investment objectives policies and strategies which are available for exchange without the incurrence of additional sales charges compliance and audit reports concerning the federated funds and the federated companies that service them including communications from regulatory agencies as well as federateds responses to any issues raised therein and relevant developments in the mutual fund industry and how the federated funds andor federated are responding to them the boards evaluation process is evolutionary the criteria considered and the emphasis placed on relevant criteria change in recognition of changing circumstances in the mutual fund marketplace with respect to the funds performance and expenses in particular the board has found the use of comparisons to other mutual funds with comparable investment programs to be relevant given the high degree of competition in the mutual fund business the board focused on comparisons with other similar annual shareholder report  mutual funds more heavily than nonmutual fund products or services because it is believed that they are more relevant for example other mutual funds are the products most like the fund they are readily available to fund shareholders as alternative investment vehicles and they are the type of investment vehicle in fact chosen and maintained by the funds investors the range of their fees and expenses therefore appears to be a generally reliable indication of what consumers have found to be reasonable in the precise marketplace in which the fund competes the funds ability to deliver competitive performance when compared to its peer group was a useful indicator of how the adviser is executing the funds investment program which in turn assisted the board in reaching a conclusion that the nature extent and quality of the advisers investment management services were such as to warrant continuation of the advisory contract in this regard the senior officer has reviewed federateds fees for providing advisory services to products outside the federated family of funds eg institutional and separate accounts he concluded that mutual funds and institutional accounts are inherently different products those differences include but are not limited to different types of targeted investors being subject to different laws and regulations different legal structures different average account sizes different associated costs different portfolio management techniques made necessary by different cash flows and portfolio manager time spent in review of securities pricing the senior officer did not consider these fee schedules to be determinative in judging the appropriateness of mutual fund advisory contracts the senior officer reviewed reports compiled by federated using data supplied by independent fund ranking organizations regarding the performance of and fees charged by other mutual funds noting his view that comparisons to fund peer groups are relevant in judging the reasonableness of proposed fees the funds performance fell below the median of the relevant peer group for the oneyear threeyear and fiveyear periods covered by the report the board discussed the funds performance with the adviser and recognized the efforts being undertaken by the adviser the board will continue to monitor these efforts and the performance of the fund the board also received financial information about federated including reports on the compensation and benefits federated derived from its relationships with the federated funds these reports covered not only the fees under the advisory contracts but also fees received by federateds subsidiaries for providing other services to the federated funds under separate contracts eg for serving as the federated funds administrator the reports also discussed any indirect benefit federated may derive from its receipt of research services from brokers who execute federated fund trades in addition the board considered the fact that in order for a fund to be competitive in the marketplace federated and its affiliates frequently waived fees andor annual shareholder report  reimbursed expenses and have disclosed to fund investors andor indicated to the board their intention to do so in the future where appropriate moreover the board receives regular reports regarding the institution or elimination of these voluntary waivers federated furnished reports requested by the senior officer that reported revenues on a fundbyfund basis and made estimates of the allocation of expenses on a fundbyfund basis using allocation methodologies specified by the senior officer the senior officer noted that although they may apply consistent allocation processes the inherent difficulties in allocating costs and the unavoidable arbitrary aspects of that exercise and the lack of consensus on how to allocate those costs may render such allocation reports unreliable the allocation reports were considered in the analysis by the board but were determined to be of limited use the board and the senior officer also reviewed a report compiled by federated comparing profitability information for federated to other publicly held fund management companies in this regard the senior officer noted the limited availability of such information but nonetheless concluded that federateds profit margins did not appear to be excessive and the board agreed the senior officers evaluation also discussed the notion of possible realization of “economies of scale” as a fund grows larger the board considered in this regard that the adviser has made significant and longterm investments in areas that support all of the federated funds such as personnel and processes for the portfolio management compliance and risk management functions and systems technology and that the benefits of these efforts as well as any economies should they exist were likely to be enjoyed by the fund complex as a whole finally the board also noted the absence of any applicable regulatory or industry guidelines on this subject which as discussed in the senior officers evaluation is compounded by the lack of any common industry practice or general pattern with respect to structuring fund advisory fees with “breakpoints” that serve to reduce the fee as the fund attains a certain size the senior officer did not recommend institution of breakpoints in pricing federateds fund advisory services at this time it was noted in the materials for the board meeting that for the period covered by the report the funds investment advisory fee after waivers and expense reimbursements if any was below the median of the relevant peer group the board reviewed the fees and other expenses of the fund with the adviser and was satisfied that the overall expense structure of the fund remained competitive the senior officers evaluation noted his belief that the information and observations contained in his evaluation supported a finding that the proposed management fees are reasonable and that federated appeared to provide appropriate administrative services to the fund for the fees paid under these annual shareholder report  circumstances no changes were recommended to and no objection was raised to the continuation of the funds advisory contract the board concluded that the nature quality and scope of services provided the fund by the adviser and its affiliates were satisfactory in its decision to continue an existing investment advisory contract the board was mindful of the potential disruptions of the funds operations and various risks uncertainties and other effects that could occur as a result of a decision to terminate or not renew an advisory contract in particular the board recognized that many shareholders have invested in the fund on the strength of the advisers industry standing and reputation and with the expectation that the adviser will have a continuing role in providing advisory services to the fund thus the boards approval of the advisory contract reflected the fact that it is the shareholders who have effectively selected the adviser by virtue of having invested in the fund the board based its decision to approve the advisory contract on the totality of the circumstances and relevant factors and with a view to past and future longterm considerations not all of the factors and considerations identified above were necessarily relevant to the fund nor did the board consider any one of them to be determinative with respect to the factors that were relevant the boards decision to approve the contract reflects its determination that federateds performance and actions provided a satisfactory basis to support the decision to continue the existing arrangements annual shareholder report  voting proxies on fund portfolio securities a description of the
