end of christendom and the future of christianity imaging god dominion as stewardship the messenger friendship faith and finding one’s way the steward a biblical symbol come of age waiting for gospel an appeal to the dispirited remnants of protestant “establishment” what christianity is not an exercise in “negative” theology when you pray thinking your way into god’s world the end of christendom and the future of christianity author douglas john hall publisher wipf  stock publication date  pages  sample pages              christianity can have a significant future—one that will be faithful to the original vision of the movement and of immense service to our beleaguered world but to have that future western christians must give up the future that  centuries of statesponsored christianity has conditioned them to covet douglas john hall traces the decline of western christendom examining ecclesiastical responses to its fall he proposes that the churches should use their disestablishment for good and describes how christians might serve dominant societies classes and institutions in a postchristian era imaging god dominion as stewardship author douglas john hall publisher wipf  stock publication date  pages  sample pages              the deterioration of our natural environment is one of the major issues of our time many analysts say that the christian concept of humanity’s “dominion” over creation is a primary cause of this crisis douglas john hall does not attempt to exonerate historical christianity from that charge—the church must own part in this predicament but hall argues confession alone is not enough the crisis forces us to rethink our whole understanding of the relationship between humanity and nature this new understanding must be based on the image of god in humanity—the imago dei hall carefully examines the biblical historical and theological meanings of this term which became christianity’s symbolic way of designating the essence of human beings he argues that the image of god is not an endowment rather it is a quality that pertains to our relationship with god we should think of imago as a verb not a noun he says the human vocation within the created order is “to image” the creator the messenger friendship faith and finding one’s way author douglas john hall publisher cascade publication date  pages  sample pages              when he was  years old douglas john hall hoped to study music professionally he met a young minister whose “different” christianity both surprised and intrigued him in the end this friendship altered the course of his life this book traces the story of their year friendship and its impact upon their lives in the process of telling his story hall reveals the importance of mentors in the lives of the young doug hall weighs in again with his characteristic gracefulness and his mature uncommon wisdom —walter brueggemann william marcellus mcpheeters professor of old testament emeritus columbia theological seminary the steward a biblical symbol come of age author douglas john hall publisher wipf  stock publication date  pages  sample pages              many christians are confused or ambivalent about their role as stewards douglas john hall recaptures the most basic meaning of the biblical metaphor of the steward and applies that meaning to our social context working from numerous angles hall explores the rich meaning and implications of stewardship he compares scriptural teaching on stewardship—concentrated in jesus’ parables—with the role of stewardship in the church’s history maintaining that ever since the fourth century the churchs understanding and practice of stewardship has been distorted by its alliance with institutional power waiting for gospel an appeal to the dispirited remnants of protestant “establishment” author douglas john hall publisher cascade publication date  pages  sample pages              douglas john hall argues that christianity first gained a foothold in the world because it proclaimed a message that awakened men and women to possibilities they had never entertained according to hall christianity’s existence is dependent on this new zest for life that is awakened in people who are transformed by a gospel that speaks to the specifics of each persons time and place religion is in decline in the west but hall challenges christians to stop devising ever more impressive promotional schemes and to hear and proclaim the gospel instead as people continue to discuss the place of the church in north america leaning on sociology and cultural studies doug hall reminds us that in the end it will be only theology a lived theology of existential depth that will help —andrew root olson baalson associate professor of youth and family ministry luther seminary st paul minnesota what christianity is not an exercise in “negative” theology author douglas john hall publisher cascade publication date  pages  sample pages              what really is christianity if all the religious packaging in which it is wrapped were removed what would remain these were dietrich bonhoeffer’s questions and douglas john hall argues that they must be ours today in many quarters christianity is so narrowly identified with a few radical parts cultural associations and past ambitions that many see it as a threat to the planetary future hall maintains that though we may no longer speak clearly of the essence of christianity perhaps we may still have a sufficiently shared sense of the core of the faith to be able to say what christianity is not in his critique of idolatrous misconstruals of the faith hall is himself a forceful antidote to the dysfunction of our society and to the dismay of the church —walter brueggemann william marcellus mcpheeters professor of old testament emeritus columbia theological seminary as one of this generations most profound theological thinkers douglas john hall reveals his magisterial grasp of the depth and complexity of the christian tradition —patricia g kirkpatrick associate professor of hebrew bible mcgill university when you pray thinking your way into god’s world author douglas john hall publisher wipf  stock publication date  pages  sample pages              when life becomes complicated with problems too painful to face christians often turn to god as a way of turning off the world for douglas john hall prayer is more than a shield from trouble or a source of comfort he calls christians to experience exciting prayer possibilities that lift us out of our selfconcern into a vital worldly stewardship in harmony with the purpose of the gospel this thoughtful study asks two significant questions what is prayer and what should we be doing when we pray hall explores the nature of prayer and the relationship between prayer thought and action he observes that “love for god and love for the world are not alternatives they are part of the same seamless robe” through prayer “god separates us from the world in order to send us back into the world with renewed spirits” about douglas john hall douglas john hall is emeritus professor of theology at mcgill university in montreal quebec among the most widely read theologians in north america hall has written many popular and acclaimed works including lighten our darkness god and human suffering and why
