and related operations through various direct and indirect wholly owned insurance companies including sun life us and keyport it proposes to simplify its corporate and operational structure so that it might operate more efficiently and reduce administrative and compliance costs to that end it intends to combine the operations of sun life us and keyport through the merger in june  sun life us and keyport entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement pursuant to which keyport will merge with and into sun life us leaving sun life us as the surviving company the merger including the transfers the mva transfer and related transactions has been approved by the boards of directors of sun life us and keyport and each partys sole shareholder the parties have obtained the other necessary formal regulatory approvals and expect to have the merger become effective on december   upon the effective date of the merger effective date sun life us will assume legal ownership of all of the assets of keyport and will become directly liable for keyports liabilities and obligations with respect to the keyport contracts then outstanding each keyport contract owner will become a contract owner of sun life us by operation of law the merger will not affect the provisions of or the rights and obligations under the keyport contracts moreover the merger will not dilute or otherwise adversely affect the economic interests of the owners of the keyport contracts nor will the merger affect the values determined under the keyport contracts the net unit value of the keyport accounts in effect immediately after the transfers will be identical to the net asset value per unit of interest in effect immediately before the transfers the merger agreement will not affect the current owners of sun life us contracts the sun life us accounts and the keyport accounts collectively the accounts are not parties to the merger agreement which will be entered into at the insurance company level as a result of the merger the accounts which are registered under the  act will continue to maintain their separate account status as unit investment trusts under the  act and as separate accounts under applicable state insurance law the accounts will not be merged into one another no charges will be imposed on or other deductions made from the keyport accounts or the sun life us accounts in connection with the merger in addition no payments will be required or charges imposed under the keyport contracts in connection with or by virtue of the merger that would not otherwise be required or imposed no new investment options will be made available to owners of the keyport contracts in connection with or by virtue of the merger nor will any existing investment options be substituted or terminated each subaccount of the keyport accounts will continue to invest in the same underlying fund as that subaccount invested in prior to the merger the merger will not directly affect any of the management investment companies underlying either the keyport accounts or the sun life us accounts collectively the funds the funds will not be a party to the merger or any related transaction the investment objectives policies and restrictions of the funds will not be changed as a result of the merger or any related transaction no investment portfolios are proposed to be added to substituted by or terminated by the funds in connection with the merger or any related transaction moreover the merger will not result in any change to the investment advisers for the funds the funds assets or the charges imposed on the funds or their shareholders in addition although the principal underwriter for keyport may change after the merger the principal underwriter will continue to be a wholly owned subsidiary of sun life us holdings sun life us and keyport have determined that no provision of the keyport contracts or state law provides the owners of those contracts the keyport contract owners with any right to optout of or to vote on or otherwise consent to the merger rather the only required votes are those of the sole voting stockholders of the merging companies moreover none of the events affecting the keyport accounts in connection with the merger require a vote of keyport contract owners under the  act in addition as described above the investment options and contractual rights and obligations under the keyport contracts will not change except that sun life us will become the depositor of the keyport accounts consequently keyport contract owners will have no investment decision to make with respect to the merger all direct and indirect costs of the merger will be borne by sun life us or keyport and not by any owners of sun life us or keyport contracts b the transfers pursuant to the merger agreement each of the keyport accounts will transfer intact to sun life us and become part of sun life us on the effective date each transferred keyport account will change its name and have sun life us as its depositor rather than keyport no other changes to the keyport accounts will result from the merger the assets and liabilities that comprise the keyport accounts immediately prior to the merger will remain intact and legally separate from any other business of sun life us as the surviving company after the merger in addition the keyport accounts will continue to fund the same keyport contracts they did immediately prior to the merger after the merger sun life us intends to accept additional payments under the transferred keyport variable contracts outstanding at the time the merger is effected and to continue offering new contracts that are identical to the contracts currently being offered but for the change in depositor sun life us will administer the keyport variable contracts in the same manner as keyport did immediately prior to the merger c the mva transfer pursuant to the merger agreement keyport will transfer assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under the keyport mva contracts to sun life us and sun life us will assume keyports obligations under such contracts on the effective date as a result of the merger each nonunitized separate account of keyport that funds the keyport mva contracts will become a nonunitized separate account of sun life us at the same time sun life us will assume legal ownership of the fixed account assets of keyport and become responsible for all the liabilities and obligations of keyport under the keyport mva contracts issued prior to the merger the mva transfer will not change the terms of the keyport mva contracts except for the succession of sun life us as the insurer under the keyport mva contracts and it will not adversely affect the values determined under or the economic interests of the owners of those contracts after the merger sun life us intends to accept additional payments under the transferred flex premium mva contracts outstanding at the time the merger is effected and to continue offering new contracts that are identical to the contracts currently being offered sun life us will administer the flex premium mva contracts in the same manner as keyport did immediately prior to the merger sun life us does not intend to offer additional single premium mva contracts or accept additional payments under outstanding single premium mva contracts or file posteffective amendments to the  act registration statement for the single premium mva contracts d procedural matters sun life us will file new registration statements on form n or form n as applicable under the  act to reflect the change in depositor of the keyport accounts and sun life uss assumption pursuant to the merger of the contractual obligations and liabilities of keyport under the keyport variable contracts the registration statements will include financial statements reflecting consummation of the merger and reflect sun life uss sponsorship of the keyport accounts as a result of the merger but will retain the historical financial information of the keyport accounts sun life us will seek to have the new registration statements declared effective on or immediately following the effective date the prospectuses included in the new registration statements will be sent to all keyport contract owners sun life us also will file a new registration statement on form s under the  act for the flexible premium mva contracts sun life us will seek to have the registration statement declared effective on or immediately following the effective date the new registration statement will reflect sun life uss assumption of the contractual obligations and liabilities of keyport with respect to the flexible premium mva contracts pursuant to the merger each person who owns a keyport mva contract at the time of the mva transfer will receive a revised prospectus reflecting the change in insurer following the effective date sun life us will not make offers or accept payments under the keyport contracts until the new registration statements filed with the commission are effective iii analysis a introduction as discussed more fully below it is our view with regard to the proposed merger including the transfers and the mva transfer that  section  of the  act and rule  thereunder are inapplicable to the merger and no registration statements on form n are required  section  of the  act is inapplicable to the merger and  section  of the  act is inapplicable to the merger but if section  is viewed as applicable to the merger transactions the transactions will comply with the conditions of section a of the  act and rule a thereunder neither sun life us nor keyport seeks noaction reassurance under section a or section d of the  act with respect to the transfers in support of our views we note that the proposed merger is analytically the same as numerous reorganizations that have been the subject of previous noaction requests seeking substantially identical relief from the provisions of the  act and  act noted above to which the staff responded favorably and which deal with stock and mutual life insurance companies involved in mergers where one or both of such companies issued variable insurance products in connection with the relief sought in this request the proposed merger poses no different issues than those present in these previous transactions b section  of the  act and rule  thereunder are inapplicable to the transfers and the mva transfer  transfers in our view the succession of sun life us to the position of depositor for the keyport accounts and coissuer of the keyport variable contracts pursuant to the transfers and any related transactions will not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security or in the creation of a new or different investment company issuer for purposes of section  of the  act or rule  thereunder rule  an interpretive rule adopted by the commission provides guidance on when certain corporate reorganizations may entail the offer or sale of a new security in exchange for outstanding securities of a corporation involved in the reorganization similar to the facts in previously issued noaction letters the terms of the merger agreement will not result in any material change to the keyport variable contracts except that by operation of law the identity of the sponsordepositor will be different these previously issued noaction letters involve circumstances virtually identical to those presented above two insurance companies merging where one or both of the companies have variable contracts outstanding each of the previously issued noaction letters indicates that just as in this case the assets and liabilities that comprised the separate account remained intact after the merger and were legally segregated from the other business of the surviving life insurance company in this case the keyport accounts will remain intact after the merger and the assets of each of the transferred keyport accounts will be legally segregated from all other assets of the depositor and will not be combined with those of any other separate account or other entity the transferred keyport variable contracts will continue to provide contract owners with the same rights and benefits after the proposed merger as before including surrender rights loan privileges annuity options and death benefits in addition the keyport variable contracts will continue to be funded by the transferred keyport accounts albeit under a new name investing in the same underlying investment vehicles as are currently available under the keyport contracts the financial history of the transferred keyport accounts will be carried forward and with the exception of the assumption of liabilities by sun life us which will be reflected by filing an amendment to each registration statement of a keyport account under the  act will not change furthermore the assumption of the insurance guarantees under the keyport variable contracts by sun life us by operation of state law will not affect those aspects of the contracts that cause them to be treated as securities ie the variable nature of the benefits under the keyport variable contracts which benefits will continue to be based on the same pool of assets as discussed above the merger is not subject by either state law or federal securities law to the vote or consent of the contract owners of either sun life us or keyport there is no material change to the security aspect of the keyport variable contracts issued by keyport and no new or different investment options will be made available to the contract owners as a result of the merger the only changes involved are the change in the depositor of the transferred keyport accounts and the assumption of existing keyport variable contracts by sun life us since there will be no vote of the contact owners relating to a new investment decision or otherwise rule  does not apply for the same reasons set forth in the aforementioned noaction letters based on the foregoing we have concluded that neither section  of the  act nor rule  thereunder is applicable to the proposed transfers and any related transactions moreover with respect to registration statements under the  act we believe that no registration statement on form n will be required to be filed in connection with the merger nonetheless we believe that the registration statements for the transferred keyport variable contracts issued through each keyport account as separate accounts of sun life us need to be in effect under the  act to cover any securities issued after the merger which may include any additional payments accepted on the transferred keyport variable contracts outstanding at the time the merger is effected and any new keyport variable contracts issued thereafter as noted above in connection with effecting the merger sun life us and the keyport accounts will file new registration statements with the commission under the  act for the transferred keyport variable contracts which registration statements will be requested to be declared effective in conjunction with the merger these new registration statements which will be filed on form n or form n as applicable will reflect the change in depositor of the keyport accounts and sun life uss assumption pursuant to the merger of the contractual obligations and liabilities of keyport under the keyport variable contracts because the transfers are to be made in connection with the merger of keyport into sun life us the registration statements also will include appropriate financial information reflecting the merger the new prospectuses will be sent to all owners of keyport variable contracts outstanding at the time the transfers are effected and will retain the historical financial information of the keyport accounts and will disclose that new premium payments will be accepted under the keyport variable contracts after the merger prior to the effective date owners of outstanding keyport variable contracts would have received disclosure from keyport informing the owners of the proposed merger including the transfers  mva transfer in our view the mva transfer will not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security for purposes of section  of the  act no change will be made to the keyport mva contracts by virtue of the mva transfer except that sun life us will succeed keyport as the insurance company responsible for providing the rights and benefits under the keyport mva contracts these rights and benefits ie surrender rights annuity options death benefits etc will remain the same keyport will transfer its nonunitized separate accounts that hold assets supporting the reserves and other liabilities under the keyport mva contracts intact to sun life us consequently when the mva transfer becomes effective sun life us will hold these assets in the same nonunitized separate accounts in which they were held prior to the transfer as discussed above owners of keyport mva contracts will not have the opportunity to optout of or to vote on or consent to the merger including the mva transfer and will not by virtue of the merger have available any new or different investment options consequently owners of keyport mva contracts will have no new investment decision to make in connection with the mva transfer we believe however that the registration statement for the transferred flexible premium mva contracts needs to be in effect under the  act to cover any securities issued after the merger which may include any additional payments accepted on the transferred flexible premium mva contracts outstanding at the time the merger is effected and any new flexible premium mva contracts issued thereafter as noted above in connection with effecting the merger sun life us and the keyport accounts will file a new registration statement with the commission under the  act for the transferred flexible premium mva contracts which registration statement will be requested to be declared effective in conjunction with the merger the new registration statement which will be filed on form s will reflect sun life uss assumption of keyports contractual obligations and liabilities with respect to the contracts pursuant to the merger because the transfers are to be made in connection with the merger of keyport into sun life us the registration statement also will include appropriate financial information reflecting the merger the new prospectus will be sent to all owners of flexible premium mva contracts outstanding at the time the transfers are effected and will disclose that new premium payments will be accepted under the flexible premium mva contracts after the merger prior to the effective date owners of outstanding flexible premium mva contracts will have received disclosure from keyport informing the owners of the proposed merger including the transfers c section  of the  act is inapplicable to the transfer of the keyport accounts it is our view that the succession of sun life us to the position of depositor for the transferred keyport accounts as a result of the merger will not result in the organization or creation of any new investment company pursuant to section  of the  act and therefore can and should be effected through the amendment of existing registration statements of the keyport accounts under the  act the filing of these amendments with the commission will be made as part of the process of filing new  act registration statements discussed above for the keyport contracts these amendments will reflect sun life us as the depositor of the keyport accounts and the transfer of contractual obligations and liabilities from keyport to sun life us as of the effective date this procedure will not necessitate the filing of new notifications of registration or registration statements for the transferred keyport accounts pursuant to section  of the  act the proposed merger will cause a change in the depositor for the keyport accounts which will involve a change in the coissuer of the keyport contracts the resulting change in the depositor due to the transfers of the keyport accounts however will not change the structure or operations of the keyport accounts or the relationship of the keyport accounts to their depositor or to the keyport contract owners the keyport accounts will continue to be treated as separate entities for all relevant purposes including financial reporting sun life us and the keyport accounts accordingly will amend the existing registration statements for the transferred keyport accounts under the  act on the effective date as discussed above d section  of the  act is inapplicable to the merger based on the analysis set forth above relating to section  of the  act it also is our view that the merger including the transfers and any related transactions will not involve an exchange of securities issued by an investment company for any other security of an investment company for purposes of section  of the  act nonetheless should these transactions be viewed as an offer of an exchange of investment company securities within the meaning of section  of the  act we believe that the transactions will comply with the conditions of section a of the  act and rule a thereunder accordingly commission approval should not be required under section  of the  act in connection with effecting the merger including the transfers and any related transactions similar to the facts in previously issued noaction letters the terms of the merger agreement will not result in any change to the keyport variable contracts except that by operation of law the identity of the depositor will change these previously issued noaction letters involved circumstances substantially similar to those presented above two insurance companies merging with one or both of the companies having variable contracts outstanding each of the previously issued noaction letters indicates that just as in this case the assets and liabilities which comprised the funding separate account after the merger remained intact and were legally segregated from the other business of the surviving life insurance company in this case the assets in each of the transferred keyport accounts will not be combined with those of any other separate account or other entity the transferred keyport variable contracts will continue to provide contract owners with the same rights and benefits after the proposed merger as before including surrender rights loan privileges annuity options and death benefits in addition the keyport variable contracts will continue to be funded by the transferred keyport accounts albeit under a new name the financial history of the transferred keyport accounts will be carried forward and with the exception of the assumption of liabilities by sun life us the keyport variable contracts will not change furthermore the assumption of the insurance guarantees under the keyport variable contracts by sun life us by operation of state law will not affect those aspects of the contracts that caused them to be treated as securities ie the variable nature of the benefits under the keyport contracts iv noaction request in view of these circumstances we respectfully request that the staff issue a letter stating that the staff will not recommend that the commission take any enforcement action against sun life us or keyport under section  of the  act and rule  thereunder in connection with the transfers and the mva transfer or under sections  and  of the  act in connection with the transfers if the merger is effect as described herein in addition we request that the staff further indicate in this letter that the staff will not recommend that the commission take any action if  the change in the depositor for the transferred keyport accounts as a result of the merger is effected through the filing of amendments to the registration statements for the keyport accounts under the  act and  new registration statements for the transferred keyport contracts under the  act are filed by sun life us and the keyport accounts to cover any securities issued in connection with the keyport contracts after the merger is effected if you have any question or require

necessary in three states the merger has been approved by the state insurance regulators in delaware and rhode island the domiciliary states of sun life us and keyport respectively and by the california department of insurance  see note  supra sun life us currently has no plans to develop and offer additional types of variable contracts through the keyport accounts after the merger  on a number of previous occasions the commission staff has been asked to provide noaction assurances which the staff has granted under sections a and d of the  act in situations when insurance companies merged and transferred separate accounts in connection with the merger see eg metropolitan life ins co pub avail may   intramerica life ins co pub avail oct   californiawestern states life ins co pub avail dec   unum life ins co pub avail oct   lincoln national pension ins co pub avail dec   and american general life ins co of delaware pub avail mar   the staff has stated in these noaction letters that neither section a nor section d of the  act is applicable in the case of a transaction like the present one the staff further stated in metropolitan life that it does not intend to issue additional noaction letters in this area absent novel facts and circumstances we do not believe that novel facts or circumstances are present with respect to the transfers and the factors discussed in the forgoing letters  see eg allstate life ins co pub avail dec   sun life insurance and annuity co of new york pub avail dec   the manufacturers life in co pub avail dec   aid association for

apply when there is submitted to security holders for a vote or consent a plan or agreement for among other things a statutory merger or consolidation or similar plan or acquisition in which securities of such corporation or other person held by such security holders will become or be exchanged for securities of any other person according to the preliminary note to rule  the thrust of the rule is that an offer offer to sell offer for sale or sale occurs when there is submitted to security holders a plan or agreement pursuant to which such holders are required to elect on the basis of what is in substance a new investment decision whether to accept a new or different security in exchange for their existing security  see the noaction letters cited in note  supra  the merger will affect only the insurance aspects of the keyport contracts ie the insurance company guaranteeing the death benefit and certain other contractual rights and will not affect those aspects that cause the keyport contracts to be treated as securities eg the cash surrender value and investment options available through the keyport accounts  see the noaction letters cited in note  and the accompanying text to note  supra  we note that the form n registration statement by its terms does not apply to separate accounts registered as unit investment trusts  while new registration statements will be filed for certain keyport variable contracts that keyport has ceased offering sun life us will rely on prior commission noaction positions in discontinuing filing posteffective amendments and delivering updated prospectuses to existing owners of these contracts see greatwest supra note  we are not requesting any noaction assurances from the staff with respect to the reliance by sun life us or keyport on these prior staff positions  see the noaction letters cited in note  supra  see the accompanying text to note  supra httpwwwsecgovdivisionsinvestmentnoactionsunlifehtm home  previous
