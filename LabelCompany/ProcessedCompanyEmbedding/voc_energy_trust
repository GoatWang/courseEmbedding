expects to receive net proceeds from the sale of  trust units offered by this prospectus of approximately  million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions structuring fees and offering expenses and an additional  million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional trust units in full fortyfive days following the closing of this offering voc sponsor will sell any trust units not sold in this offering to voc partners llc at the initial public offering price voc sponsor intends to use the net proceeds from this offering including any proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional trust units and the sale of trust units to voc partners llc to repay approximately  million of outstanding borrowings under its credit facility to repurchase certain outstanding equity interests in voc sponsor for approximately  million and to make cash distributions to its remaining limited partners voc sponsor is deemed to be an underwriter with respect to the trust units offered hereby the oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive voc sponsor competes with major oil and natural gas companies and independent oil and natural gas companies for oil and natural gas equipment personnel and markets for the sale of oil and natural gas many of these competitors are financially stronger than voc sponsor but even financially troubled competitors can affect the market because of their need to sell oil and natural gas at any price to attempt to maintain cashflow the trust will be subject to the same competitive conditions as voc sponsor and other companies in the oil and natural gas industry oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers primarily based on price these alternate forms of energy include electricity coal and fuel oils changes in the availability or price of oil natural gas or other forms of energy as well as business conditions conservation legislation regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas future price fluctuations for oil and natural gas will directly impact trust distributions estimates of reserves attributable to the trust’s interests and estimated and actual future net revenues to the trust in view of the many uncertainties that affect the supply and demand for oil and natural gas neither the trust nor voc sponsor can make reliable predictions of future oil and natural gas supply and demand future product prices or the effect of future product prices on the trust company description voc energy trust is a delaware statutory trust formed in november  by voc sponsor to own a term net profits interest representing the right to receive  of the net proceeds calculated as described below from production from substantially all of the interests in oil and natural gas properties in the states of kansas and texas held by voc sponsor as of the date of the conveyance of the net profits interest to the trust we refer to the conveyed interest as the “net profits interest” the net profits interest will terminate on the later to occur of  december   or  the time from and after january   when  mmboe which is the equivalent of  mmboe in respect of the net profits interest have been produced from the underlying properties and sold as of december   the underlying properties produced predominantly oil from approximately  gross  net wells located in  fields as of december   the underlying properties had a weighted average age calculated on a pv basis of approximately  years and assuming an average price of  per bbl the average per bbl price for  the weighted average expected remaining reserve life calculated on a pv basis of the reserves attributable to the underlying properties was approximately  years as of december   substantially all of the underlying properties are located in mature oil fields that are characterized by long production histories and several additional development opportunities which may help to diminish natural declines in production from the underlying properties as of december   the total proved reserves attributable to the underlying properties were  mmboe of which approximately  were classified as proved developed producing reserves and approximately  were oil and approximately  were natural gas based on the reserve reports the net profits interest would entitle the trust to receive net proceeds from the sale of production of  mmboe of proved reserves during the term of the trust calculated as  of the proved reserves attributable to the underlying properties expected to be produced during the term of the trust during the year ended december   average net production from the underlying properties was approximately  boe per day or  boe per day attributable to the trust comprised of approximately  oil and approximately  natural gas as of december   approximately  of the total proved reserves relating to the underlying properties based on pretax present value of estimated future net revenue using a discount rate of ten percent per annum “pv” were operated or operated on a contract operator basis by vess oil corporation which we refer to as “vess oil” l d drilling inc or davis petroleum inc which we refer to collectively with vess oil as the “voc operators” for the years   and  voc sponsor has entered into swap contracts which we refer to as the “hedge contracts” at weighted average prices ranging from  to  per barrel of oil that hedge approximately  of expected oil production for such years from the proved developed producing reserves attributable to the underlying properties in the summary reserve reports the hedge contracts should help mitigate the impact of any crude oil price volatility on distributions made on the trust units during the term of the hedge contracts upon expiration in  unitholder exposure to fluctuations in crude oil prices will increase significantly the trust will make quarterly cash distributions of substantially all of its quarterly cash receipts after deduction of fees and expenses for the administration of the trust which are estimated to be approximately  in  to holders of its trust units during the term of the trust the first quarterly distribution is expected to be made on or about august   to trust unitholders owning trust units on or about august   the trust’s first quarterly distribution will consist of an amount in cash paid by voc sponsor equal to the amount that would have been payable to the trust had the net profits interest been in effect during the period from january   through june   less any general and administrative expenses and reserves of the trust as a result of the extended period of time that will be included in the first quarterly distribution subsequent quarterly distributions are likely to be less than the initial distribution because payments to the trust will be generated by depleting assets and the trust has a finite life with the production from the underlying properties diminishing over time a portion of each distribution will represent in effect a return of your original investment the trust will receive quarterly cash receipts from the net proceeds attributable to the net profits interest with such net proceeds generally being equal to  of the gross proceeds received from sales of oil and natural gas attributable to the underlying properties for each calendar quarter less production and development costs and amounts that may be reserved for future development maintenance or operating expenditures which reserve amounts may not exceed  million in the aggregate at any given time and after giving effect to the impact of the hedge contracts net proceeds payable to the trust will generally depend upon among other things the impact of hedge contracts volumes produced wellhead prices price differentials and production and development costs if the trust does not receive net proceeds pursuant to the net profits interest or if such net proceeds are reduced the trust will not be able to distribute cash to the trust unitholders or such cash distributions will be reduced respectively for the year ended december   lease operating expenses were  per boe and production and property taxes were  per boe for an aggregate production cost for the underlying properties of  per boe as substantially all of the underlying properties are located in mature fields voc sponsor does not expect its total future production costs for the underlying properties to change significantly as compared to recent historical costs other than changes in costs due to any increases in the cost of general oilfield services in its operating areas the amount of cash available for distribution by the trust will be reduced by the general and administrative costs of the trust the business and affairs of the trust will be managed by the bank of new york mellon
