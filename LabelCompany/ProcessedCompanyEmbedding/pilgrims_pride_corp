hard work smart and support each other in order to win     our history the story began on october   when aubrey pilgrim and his partner pat johns purchased a feed and seed store for  from w w weems in pittsburg texas soon after forming the partnership aubrey asked his brother lonnie bo pilgrim to join them the early days in the early days the pilgrims would sell  baby chicks and a sack of feed to local farmers who would take the chicks home and raise them in their back yards keeping some for family needs and bringing back the remainder when they were grown selling baby chicks to drive feed sales was one of several innovative ideas that would later lead to the vertical integration model of poultry production used by nearly every major poultry company today overcoming obstacles the pilgrim brothers faced a number of tremendous challenges in building their new business there was nothing remotely close to a longrange plan a strategic plan or a business plan associated with farmers feed and seed bo recalled i doubt if there was even very much time for daydreaming about a future we were working long hours sometimes hauling a load of peas over to the cass county canning co in atlanta texas not getting home until three oclock in the morning then getting to the store to open it at seven oclock the fact is it was all about survival survival meant meeting a customers expectations so the customer would become a return customer he soon learned not only to survive but also how make a business grow the first year i was with my brother as a partner we added a warehouse to the store and with it a loading ramp unloading pit an elevator to carry feed to a bagging machine and an electric sewing machine for the feed sacks he said bos early process improvements allowed the company to dramatically reduce wasted grain which used to be lost through the cracks of the floor in the feed store and enabled the pilgrim brothers to use automation to sell truckloads of feed out of the warehouse we began to grow in a way that looking back was a set of small but integrated steps we didnt know it at the time of course that our steps were linked in some way we were simply responding to one opportunity after the next in retrospect the pieces of a fairly elaborate puzzle were beginning to fall into place said bo         the puzzle soon began to take shape as opportunities came in the form of acquisitions and capital improvements the first major expansion came in the s when the pilgrim brothers purchased the hudson cotton gin and a hatchery in mt pleasant texas they leased their first chickenprocessing plant in mt pleasant in  tragedy struck in  when aubrey pilgrim died of a heart attack leaving bo to lead the company he had worked so hard to help establish as bo remembers i cant begin to tell you what a shock aubreys death was to me my whole world was shaken aubrey and i were brothers and business partners nobody was closer to me after a long sleepless night bo pilgrim decided it was up to him to continue the pilgrims legacy that single decision gave my life direction from that day forward he said i had every hope and intention and motivating desire to run the company to even greater heights failure was not an option growth through acquisitions in the years ahead the company continued to grow and thrive purchasing market produce of fort worth in  and undergoing two name changes pilgrims corporation and pilgrim industries inc several other acquisitions followed and on november   pilgrims pride corporation became a publicly owned company listed on the new york stock exchange one year later the company expanded into mexico in the s pilgrims pride continued its growth acquiring green acre foods inc in nacogdoches texas fastforward to the acquisition of wlr foods inc in  which expanded the companys sales and marketing capabilities from coast to coast and the purchase of conagras chicken division in  which doubled the size of the company and helped generate record sales and earnings growth for pilgrims pride on december   pilgrims pride completed the acquisition of atlantabased gold kist for  billion in cash and the assumption of approximately  million of debt at the time gold kist had been the thirdlargest poultry processor in america processing  million birds per week and employing  people at the time it was acquired by pilgrims pride with the addition of gold kist pilgrims became the worlds leading chicken company in terms of production and the fourthlargest us meat protein company by revenues but by  the chicken market had changed dramatically recordhigh corn prices an oversupply of chicken and financial constraints combined to force pilgrims pride to file for chapter  bankruptcy protection in december  the company brought in a new ceo don jackson who steered the company through a month reorganization in which it closed plants eliminated thousands of administrative and production jobs and refocused on becoming a marketdriven company in december  pilgrims emerged from its reorganization as a stronger more competitive company pilgrims also achieved an incredibly rare feat for companies

health safety concern by fda if accidently consumed or cooked with the chicken why does my chicken weigh less than the package states in october of  the united states department of agriculture usda eliminated the wet tare method used for determining net weight of poultry and meat products purchased by consumers the wet tare method for determining net weight of poultry and meat products does not include liquids absorbed into packaging materials or freeflowing in the package as part of the net weight of the product usda now mandates the use of dry tare procedures this means that the net weight of the product includes all fluid absorbed into the packaging and any freeflowing fluid in the package pilgrim’s plants are in compliance with usda procedures and product is inspected onsite by usda staff additional information on this policy can be found on the usda website at httpwwwfsisusdagovoppderdadfrpubshtm additionally our plants use water during processing to cool the chicken this will cause some natural pick up of moisture during this process as chicken ages in the store and nears its expiration date the product will lose moisture thus being absorbed by the soaker pad in the

history the story began on october   when aubrey pilgrim and his partner pat johns purchased a feed and seed store for  from w w weems in pittsburg texas soon after forming the partnership aubrey asked his brother lonnie bo pilgrim to join them the early days in the early days the pilgrims would sell  baby chicks and a sack of feed to local farmers who would take the chicks home and raise them in their back yards keeping some for family needs and bringing back the remainder when they were grown selling baby chicks to drive feed sales was one of several innovative ideas that would later lead to the vertical integration model of poultry production used by nearly every major poultry company today overcoming obstacles the pilgrim brothers faced a number of tremendous challenges in building their new business there was nothing remotely close to a longrange plan a strategic plan or a business plan associated with farmers feed and seed bo recalled i doubt if there was even very much time for daydreaming about a future we were working long hours sometimes hauling a load of peas over to the cass county canning co in atlanta texas not getting home until three oclock in the morning then getting to the store to open it at seven oclock the fact is it was all about survival survival meant meeting a customers expectations so the customer would become a return customer he soon learned not only to survive but also how make a business grow the first year i was with my brother as a partner we added a warehouse to the store and with it a loading ramp unloading pit an elevator to carry feed to a bagging machine and an electric sewing machine for the feed sacks he said bos early process improvements allowed the company to dramatically reduce wasted grain which used to be lost through the cracks of the floor in the feed store and enabled the pilgrim brothers to use automation to sell truckloads of feed out of the warehouse we began to grow in a way that looking back was a set of small but integrated steps we didnt know it at the time of course that our steps were linked in some way we were simply responding to one opportunity after the next in retrospect the pieces of a fairly elaborate puzzle were beginning to fall into place said bo         the puzzle soon began to take shape as opportunities came in the form of acquisitions and capital improvements the first major expansion came in the s when the pilgrim brothers purchased the hudson cotton gin and a hatchery in mt pleasant texas they leased their first chickenprocessing plant in mt pleasant in  tragedy struck in  when aubrey pilgrim died of a heart attack leaving bo to lead the company he had worked so hard to help establish as bo remembers i cant begin to tell you what a shock aubreys death was to me my whole world was shaken aubrey and i were brothers and business partners nobody was closer to me after a long sleepless night bo pilgrim decided it was up to him to continue the pilgrims legacy that single decision gave my life direction from that day forward he said i had every hope and intention and motivating desire to run the company to even greater heights failure was not an option growth through acquisitions in the years ahead the company continued to grow and thrive purchasing market produce of fort worth in  and undergoing two name changes pilgrims corporation and pilgrim industries inc several other acquisitions followed and on november   pilgrims pride corporation became a publicly owned company listed on the new york stock exchange one year later the company expanded into mexico in the s pilgrims pride continued its growth acquiring green acre foods inc in nacogdoches texas fastforward to the acquisition of wlr foods inc in  which expanded the companys sales and marketing capabilities from coast to coast and the purchase of conagras chicken division in  which doubled the size of the company and helped generate record sales and earnings growth for pilgrims pride on december   pilgrims pride completed the acquisition of atlantabased gold kist for  billion in cash and the assumption of approximately  million of debt at the time gold kist had been the thirdlargest poultry processor in america processing  million birds per week and employing  people at the time it was acquired by pilgrims pride with the addition of gold kist pilgrims became the worlds leading chicken company in terms of production and the fourthlargest us meat protein company by revenues but by  the chicken market had changed dramatically recordhigh corn prices an oversupply of chicken and financial constraints combined to force pilgrims pride to file for chapter  bankruptcy protection in december  the company brought in a new ceo don jackson who steered the company through a month reorganization in which it closed plants eliminated thousands of administrative and production jobs and refocused on becoming a marketdriven company in december  pilgrims emerged from
