chadwick rantanen  jonathan griffin jonathan griffin criticism and essays on art and culture chadwick rantanen by jonathan griffin team bungalow los angeles chadwick rantanen deer rear  installation view team bungalow los angeles the pall of death hangs over chadwick rantanen’s exhibition ‘alarmer’ this is ironic because many of the constituent objects in his assemblage sculptures are expressly designed to simulate life batteryoperated hunting decoys flap their wings and wag their tails in order to attract animals that are living though soon to be dead rantanen’s deer rear all works  is a pitiful construction the stylized hindquarters of a deer are laid on the floor black electrical guts spilling out of the creature’s belly with an irregular force and tempo its tail twitches as if it were in the final stages of expiration in a sense this is indeed the case the tail is powered by a dying power pack which the artist has fitted with batteries smaller than those intended by the manufacturer as a paradoxical consequence the decoy is animated with an uncannily realistic weariness rantanen often works with brandnew objects that are already tired in all sorts of ways consumer products probably made in chinabut associated with redstate americana speak of a broader national malaise between the petrochemical origin of these plastics and the decoys’ intended violence there liesan implicit position of antagonismtowards the natural environment even as its resources are depleted the batteries that power the kinetic sculptures in ‘alarmer’ are cased in plastic sleeves designed by rantanen which resemble cartoon bees these yellow and black striped covers enable them to fit into slots for the fatter and higher capacity batteries while their plastic wings serve no function except to prevent the cover from closing bees today are contradictory symbols of utopian collectivism and – as colony collapse disorder takes hold across north america and parts of europe – of environmental catastrophe all around deer rear in the shedlike back gallery of team bungalow sculptures that look like ornate jorge pardodesigned flypapers hang from the ceiling the templates for the scalloped forms come from a pattern designed for products meant for use in hospitals – gowns wallpaper curtains carpets – which is intended to be aesthetically inert the installation is titled hanging strips yellow – yellow because parts of the translucent plastic are smeared repellently with silicone glue stuck to this mucous substance are wrinkled flakes ofa darker material identified by the checklist as antimicrobial film – which rantanen reportedly painstakingly scrapes off hospital fabrics the result is an artwork for the postnature era the icky smeared silicone and antimicrobial film reappears in another medically inflected sculpture admitting green a folded rectangle of corrugated plastic on the floor the interior gunk only visible through circular apertures and its two open ends far more compelling is the large hanging sculpture crow spread with which it shares team bungalow’s front space this showstopping work resembles the horrific spectacle of six crows strung up by their feet and flapping in panic as with deer rear the birds are decoys hacked by rantanen’s battery adapters busy bees that seem like parasites cheerfully speeding the death throes of the trapped birds the piece is a chandelier for a psychopath’s dining room the final irony of course is that any owner of these kinetic sculptures will be obliged to care for them by endlessly replacing the batteries which the motors drain all too quickly the bees may be powering these endoflife simulations but they are themselves designed to die fast deception is built upon cruel deception the illusion of life in these works leads to death if you’re a crow or to a repeating simulation of death if you’re lucky enough to be a human   first published frieze issue  may  advertisements share

site site archive chadwick proposes increasing legal age to buy tobacco products tuesday sep   at  am sep   at  am by andrew denneyadenneycolumbiatribunecom   first ward councilwoman ginny chadwick has called for columbia to ban the use of ecigarettes indoors and to increase the minimum age to buy tobacco products in the city to the council unanimously passed a motion just after midnight on tuesday at its regular meeting to send the legislative intent for chadwick�s proposal to the city�s board of health and substance abuse advisory commission for review before a complete bill is presented to the council for a votesmoking in indoor public spaces has been banned in columbia since in remarks during the council comments portion of the meeting agenda in which council members are able to propose motions for a vote chadwick said raising the minimum age would lower the use of tobacco products by youth by making it easier to spot underage purchasers decrease cultural acceptance of youth smoking and cut off peers� access to the products�this decrease will create lasting benefits on the prevalence of tobacco use and save thousands of lives in columbia� chadwick saidjonathan sessions a member of the columbia board of education said he approached chadwick with the idea of increasing the tobaccosale age while she was still running for office earlier this year sessions said that because there are yearold students at columbia public schools there is potential for students to legally acquire tobacco products and then distribute them to younger students�it happened when i was in school it happened i�m sure before i was in school it happens to this day� sessions saidaccording to a food and drug administration center for tobacco products literature review released last december there are a number of barriers to determining the toxicity of ecigarettes there is sparse data available on the effects of exposing humans to ecigarettes ecigarette users also might use cigarettes � which can alter exposure levels � and some research has indicated that nicotine delivery levels from ecigarettes can vary substantially even among devices within the same branddespite the dearth of available information about the product advertising for ecigarettes has been aggressiveaccording to an analysis of ecigarette websites conducted this year by the san francisco center for tobacco control research and education  percent of the websites made explicit health claims  percent said the devices can be used anywhere and  percent mentioned smoking cessationdan rader a member of the substance abuse advisory commission and coowner of bengal�s bar and grill in downtown columbia said he thinks the proposals are a �step in the right direction� the use of ecigarettes by bengal�s patrons has caused issues at the bar in the past he said as staff and fellow patrons have confused the devices with cigarettesadditionally rader said he supports applying the same age restrictions that are in place for alcohol to tobacco products�i think it�s become quite clear over time that cigarettes are harmful� rader said �bringing that minimum age more in line with the minimum age for alcohol it makes sense� subscribe today choose the plan that’s right for you digital access or digital and print delivery learn more jonathan chadwick iframe srcwwwgoogletagmanagercomnshtmlidgtmppzpq
