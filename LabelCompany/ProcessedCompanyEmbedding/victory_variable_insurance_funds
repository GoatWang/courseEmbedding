investment objectives and policies and in some cases similar names to retail mutual funds managed by the same manager the portfolios named are not the same funds as the retail funds as a result specific investments may be different and investment results may be higher or lower while all funds involve some risk including possible loss of principal amount invested there are some additional risks to consider when investing in certain types of funds or certain types of asset classes that comprise a fund’s portfolio for further information on risks associated with the various funds see the fund prospectuses a foreign securities and emerging markets risk investing in international funds or funds that invest any of their assets in foreign securities has special risks relating to changes in currency rates foreign taxation differences in auditing and other financial standards political uncertainty and greater volatility these risks are even greater when investing in emerging markets b small cap and mid cap companies risk risks associated with investments in small and mid cap companies include less publicly available information higher volatility and less liquidity than investments in larger companies c concentration risk investments concentrated in specific industries market segments regions or securities may be subject to increased share price volatility d debt securities risk investing in bond funds or funds that invest any of their assets in debt securities exposes the contractowner to the general risks of investing in debt markets such as interest rate credit and prepayment risk generally when interest rates rise bond prices fall and when interest rates fall bond prices rise therefore an increase in interest rates would decrease the value of a bond fund’s holdings the ability of an issuer of a debt security to repay principal prior to a security’s maturity can cause greater price volatility if interest rates change duration is a measure of bond price sensitivity to a given change in interest rates generally the longer a bond’s duration the greater is its price sensitivity to a change in interest rates however low duration bond funds are not an alternative to money market funds low duration bond funds unlike money market funds do not seek to maintain a stable net asset value and as a result are a riskier asset class e high yield debt securities risk investments in high yield bonds or lower rated and unrated debt securities are subject to greater credit risk and price fluctuation than investments in higherrated securities f derivatives risk since the value of a derivative instrument derives from an underlying asset the use of derivatives involves risks different from and possibly greater than the risks associated with investing directly in the underlying assets derivatives can be highly volatile illiquid and difficult to value total returns for these investment options reflect the effects of one or more of the
