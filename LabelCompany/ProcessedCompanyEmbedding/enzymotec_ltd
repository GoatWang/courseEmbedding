omega the stock reached a  week high of  pps on august   on that day the trading volume was only  for the proceeding months the company experienced a steady selloff dropping to a  week low of  pps on november   ycharts reflects prices at closing enzy data by ycharts the historic price reaction is significant as it again approached the  week high in february of  as of late it remains within  of that high mark the speculative sentiment of a pullback is compounded when considering that quarterly revenue and earnings have steadily declined enzy data by ycharts enzyomotec competitor charts opposing growth in opposite fashion to enzymotecs declining revenue and earnings is neptune wellness solutions aka neptune technologies  bioressources inc nasdaq nept further review of neptune can be read at interview neptune wellness solutions ceo jim hamilton they have had two major acquisitions and two major patent settlementsagreements with them being the victors in addition to the financial gain neptune secured the right to use the competitors patents feb   acquired neurobiopharm inc jan   acquired biodroga inc oct   agreement with aker biomarine for a gain of m april   settlement with enzymotec ltd for a gain of m the synergies and organic growth of neptune show revenue increasing and paced to overtake the declining revenue of enzymotec nept revenue quarterly data by ycharts when the two companies have their earnings per share compared it illustrates further convergence nept eps diluted ttm data by ycharts more on krill market share and the settlement during the year ended december   our enzymotec ltd twelve largest customers accounted for approximately half of our revenues our customers generally do not enter longterm purchase commitments with us and we may therefore have limited insight into their future purchasing plans our largest customers may determine to lower their purchasers or cease purchasing our products completely for example one of our largest purchasers of krill products which accounted for  of our revenues in  purchased our products at significantly lower levels in  through  even if a significant customer continues to purchase our products at the same or a greater level their decision to defer purchases even for a few weeks could materially adversely impact our results of operations in a particular quarter and can result in quartertoquarter variability in our financial results for example some of al’s customers in china deferred purchases from al which had an adverse effect on our quarterly results during  and  the success or failure losing market share for example of just a few of our customers’ businesses could have a material effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our business may not develop in a manner that would make us less reliant on a small number of large customers our results of operations may be materially adversely affected if a significant customer elects to stop purchasing our products and we are unable to find new purchasers to offset the loss of that customer  sec form form f fiscal year ended dec  this statement of risk makes more sense when read within the context of the recent settlement with neptune technologies  bioressources inc neptune can utilize enzymotecs patents potentially luring away the customer base neptune specializes in omgea products while this is merely a declining segment of enzymotecs portfolio the other risk factor that materialized is neptunes krill nutrient growth in china on april   neptune technologies  bioressources inc entered a joint venture with a chinese partner the jv will lead to the construction of a stateoftheart krill harvesting vessel in the krill oil market we enzymotec ltd primarily compete with aker biomarine as neptune technologies  bioressources inc or neptune rimfrost usa llc a joint venture of avoca inc and olympic seafood as see “– risks relating to our business and industry – the demand for products based on omega and in particular premium products such as krill oil has declined in the past and may continue to decline this decrease together with a significant increase in capacity by competing manufacturers namely neptune of these products has resulted in and may continue to cause intense competition and price pressure which could impair our ability to generate revenues in the krill oil market  sec form form f fiscal year ended dec  conclusion enzymotec ltd had foreseen neptune technologies  bioressources inc as a major risk in the krillomega space they had also tried to putoff paying royalties and settlements as long as possible the recent payment to neptune and neptunes expansion into china is the nail in the coffin for enymotecs krill segment furthermore neptune is building upon one of its best quarters has turned profitable and the fiscal year q  results are due out soon these two healthcare companies are in direct competition with a clear winner enzymotec ltd

global supplier of specialty lipidbased products and solutions the company develops manufactures and markets innovative bioactive lipid ingredients as well as final products based on sophisticated processes and technologies forward looking statements this press release may contain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended and the safe harbor provisions of the us private securities litigation reform act of  that are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management forwardlooking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by terms such as “anticipates” “believes” “could” “seeks” “estimates” “expects” “intends” “may” “plans” “potential” “predicts” “projects” “should” “will” “would” or similar expressions that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes and the negatives of those terms forwardlooking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations business strategies financing plans competitive position industry environment potential growth opportunities potential market opportunities and the effects of competition such statements involve a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause our future results performance or achievements to differ significantly from the results performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements some of the important factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include the following a high proportion of the sales of the infat® product is to our customers who then use it in their infant formula products sold to end users in china and therefore our revenues are subject to the effects of chinese market trends and competition from locally produced products that are not subject to import taxes we are subject to a degree of customer concentration and our customers do not enter into longterm purchase commitments with us new chinese regulations relating to infant formula came into force on october  and others are constantly evaluated affecting the ability of our customers to market infant nutrition products containing infat® which could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations we rely on our swedish joint venture partner to manufacture infat® growth in the chinese economy has moderated and this slowdown and related volatility could adversely impact demand for our products in china the demand for products based on omega and in particular premium products such as krill oil has declined in the past and may continue to decline which together with a significant increase in capacity by competing manufacturers may continue to cause intense competition and price pressures chinese regulations relating to infant formula are under reexamination and any regulatory changes affecting the ability of our customers to market infant nutrition products containing infat® could adversely affect our business our inventories include sensitive compounds which may face spoilage or obsolescence our inability to manage our inventory levels in particular our high level of inventory relative to sales of our products may have an adverse effect on our profitability a significant portion of the sales of our infat® product is to a small number of customers and if such customers were to suffer financially or reduce their use of infat® our business could be materially adversely affected variations in the cost of raw materials for the production of our products may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our offering of products as medical foods may be challenged by regulatory authorities the outcome of the companys discussions with the fda relating to the import alert our product development cycle is lengthy and uncertain and our development or commercialization efforts for our products may be unsuccessful we are dependent on a single facility that houses the majority of our operations and disruptions at this facility could negatively affect our business financial condition and operations we depend on third parties to obtain raw materials in particular krill necessary for the production of our products and if we cannot secure sufficient supply sources at competitive prices or need to utilize a greater percentage of frozen krill than anticipated with current inventory levels our gross profits from the sale of krill oil will be adversely affected we anticipate that the markets in which we participate will become more competitive due in part to business combinations among existing competitors the arrival of new competitors and technological developments our results are subject to quarterly fluctuations we may have to pay royalties with respect to sales of our krill oil products in the united states or australia and any infringement of intellectual property of others could require us to pay royalties unfavorable publicity or consumer perception of our products such as krill oil the supplements that contain them as ingredients and any similar products distributed by other companies could have a material adverse effect on our reputation the demand for our products and our ability to generate revenues we are generally reliant upon third parties for the distribution or commercialization of our products we may not be able to maintain or increase market acceptance for our products we are subject to risks relating to the operation and expansion of our production or processing facilities and capabilities our ability to obtain krill may be affected by conservation regulation or initiatives disruption to our it system could adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations we are not able to predict the results of clinical trials which may prove unsuccessful or be delayed by certain factors if we are unable to maintain manufacturing efficiency and quality and meet our customers’ needs our financial performance could be adversely affected we could be subject to product liability lawsuits which could result in costly and timeconsuming litigation and significant liabilities our dependence on international sales which expose us to risks associated with the business environment in those countries and other factors discussed under the heading risk factors in our annual report on form f for the year ended
