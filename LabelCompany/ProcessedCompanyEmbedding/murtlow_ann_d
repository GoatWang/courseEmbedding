by ann d murtlow indianapolis power  light co larry doran peterborough utilities groupann d murtlowby kristen wright associate editoreditors at electric light  power magazine in the fall asked readers to nominate ceos of north american electric utilities in two categories the large utility ceo must work at a north american utility having  or more customers the small utility ceo must work at a north american utility having fewer than  customers after examining every essay entry the editors agreedthe ceo of the year in the large utility division is ann d murtlow president and ceo of indianapolis power  light co the ceo of the year in the small utility division is larry doran president and ceo of peterborough utilities group in peterborough ontario canadawe interviewed both winners and presented their awards jan  during the second annual electric light  power executive conference in san diegolarry dorannative advertisementelp when you were young did you aspire to become a utility ceo how did you get where you aremurtlow i cant say i ever aspired to this position but now that im here i have to admit that i feel very privileged to work as a leader in an industry that is so fundamental to the lives and livelihoods of our customers and communities it is hard to find another industry where the pursuit of excellence can be so meaningful to so manyi was fortunate to have exposure to the power business early in my life my father who has electrical and nuclear engineering degrees worked for the utility industry most of his career first as an engineer and then as a senior executive he was deeply involved in the development of the us nuclear industry and i was fascinated with the subject both because it was technically interesting and because it was controversial i toured my first nuclear plant and uranium mine when i was  years oldi went to college to become a chemical engineer and upon graduation worked for bechtel power corporation designing power plant systems and licensing nuclear plants i was recruited to aes in  when the company was just a startup and the independent power industry was in its infancy i had the opportunity to work for some brilliant people who were willing to both teach me and bet on my abilities i became the companys environmental expert as aes grew to be one of the worlds largest global power companies my ability to ascend and grow was only limited by my willingness to take on new challenges after leading the aes warrior run cogeneration project to a successful  million financial closing i went abroad to develop new business in europe and africa shortly thereafter i was leading all of aes operations construction and development in  european countries in  a year after aes acquisition of ipalco enterprises and its subsidiary indianapolis power  light company ipl i was recruited to lead the integrated utility which serves nearly  customers and its parent company it was my first foray into the regulated side of the industryit has been an honor to lead such a talented team on a great journey over the past eight yearsdoran until my first year of university i really hadnt decided on any specific career much less a specific industry once in engineering however i quickly concluded that a career that combined technical and financial knowledge was what interested me mostin second year i obtained a summer job with ontario hydro and two years later joined them on a fulltime basis right out of school the same week i started with ontario hydro i began working toward my mba through evening classes over the next  years with ontario hydro and its successor ontario power generation opg i had the opportunity to work in most areas of utility business distribution transmission generation marketing business development and system planning i left opg in  ran my own consulting company for a couple of years before joining peterborough utilities as president and ceo in elp ann tell me about your sustainability projects at indianapolis power  light co such as wind generation and electric car partnershipsmurtlow ipl has approximately  mw of generating capacity which meets the vast majority of our customer demand in  approximately  percent of our capacity and  percent of our energy came from coalfired generation in the face of increasingly stringent environmental regulations and the potential for greenhouse gas regulation we decided to take a proactive approach to diversifying our supplywe were able to secure longterm power purchase agreements with two wind farms one in indiana and the other in minnesota as a result of these agreements  percent of ipls energy will be renewable by  in addition we have spent more than  million during the past five years to add or upgrade environmental controls at our largest coalfired units we are currently in the process of upgrading the flue gas desulfurization on one of our largest unitsin addition we are also engaged in pilot programs for smart grid and electric vehicles supported by a  million grant from the us department of energy our electric vehicle pilot program called project plugin is unique in its partnerships we are working with more than  partners including companies with auto and related components design and manufacturing state government agencies retail and parking merchants and utilities to advance electric vehicles in our market and make the experience seamless for customers across utility service territorieselp larry peterborough utilities group recently started expanding outside of just distributing water and electricity within the city tell me about those projectsdoran the peterborough utilities group pug has been operating the local water and electrical distribution systems for almost a hundred years in addition it has owned and operated a small hydroelectric generation facility for more than three decades however it was the opening of the ontario electricity market in  and then the green energy act of  that provided both the impetus and the opportunity for pug to dramatically increase our renewable generation portfoliopeterborough utilities groups  mw robert g lake generating stationlate in  we brought into service a new  mw hydroelectric generation facility within the next month we will produce the first power from our  mw solar farm this will be followed by a  mw landfill gas facility in early  and a  mw expansion of one of our hydroelectric facilities within two more yearspeterborough utility groups  mw lily lake solar farm in ontario canadaelp the pug solar farm is a big deal because ontario has vowed to shut domestic coalgenerating stations by  how far along is the solar farm has it hit any snags along the waydoran the solar farm is expected to produce first power within the month and be completely in service by the end of march like all large projects we have had some challenges along the way but i am pleased to report that we are now on the home stretch the total time from us acquiring the site to producing first power will be under  monthselp what has been your most difficult decision as ceo and what was the outcomemurtlow my most difficult important and rewarding decisions involved creating the platform for ipl to be successful going forward and building the senior team who would execute its implementation and leadership prior to the acquisition in  ipl was a successful traditional vertically integrated utility that had never faced the competition that led so many companies in our industry to change it was my goal to transform ipl through the creation of an operating strategy that would drive sustainable excellence and continuous improvementin building a new senior team i wanted to create balance between the credibility history and talent that longtime ipl people could bring and the need for change that talented people from outside the company would offer i settled on a small team of senior executives which provided the best of both pools it is a pleasure to work with a team that brings a wide range of experience and perspective to our decisionmakingthe collaborative internal effort resulted in our be the best btb operating philosophy that drives the creation of extraordinary value for our stakeholders through a concentration in seven major areas of performance safety financial performance rates and shareholder value reliability wires and generation commitment to compliance employee engagement customer satisfaction and community leadership this philosophy combined with our global aes values and the ipl pledge which defines the expected behaviors of ipl leaders and individual contributors have created a culture of flexibility and continuous improvement that has allowed us to create an excellent value proposition for our customers communities and shareholdersdoran the most difficult decisions are always those that involve people during the past five years i have concentrated on putting together and developing the strongest team possible i believe that our consistently strong financial operating performance and safety results demonstrate that weve been successful in that regardelp what have you done to keep your companies afloat during the great recessionmurtlow an organizations ability to survive and thrive in hard times is built into its culture and operating philosophy we are a lean organization and we are always looking to maintain the right quality and quantity of people in the right places within the organization to meet our future needs we also strive to drive and plan for good times while remaining prepared to quickly implement financial recovery plans in the event of a downturn it was this plan developed in  which allowed us to swiftly react to rapidly deteriorating economic conditions in  the plan was developed collectively by the leadership team of ipl and had a high level of buy in when it became apparent that we needed to act the plan was executed by the ipl team with skill and determination resulting in significant mitigation of margin that otherwise would have been lost due to a decrease in customer load we are absolutely delighted that despite the challenges of the past few years ipl remains one of the lowestcost and highestreliability providers of retail electric service with an excellent customer satisfaction ratingdoran the recession poised more challenges for some of our customers than for pug although their problems become our problems to some degree through a combination of productivity gains and the success of our development projects weve been able to hold rates down and consistently improve net income we achieved a  percent increase in net income in  and expect an increase of a similar magnitude in elp how is smart metering coming alongmurtlow its going very well ipl was an early adopter of automated meter reading amr equipment in the late s this technology which allows for meter reading using cellular technology is now being leveraged to achieve twoway communications to help a subset of ipls customers manage their energy usage ipl is installing an advanced metering infrastructure ami system including a radio mesh network and data collection system to serve its large commercial and industrial customers and a portion of the existing residential amr customers this pilot strikes the right balance between the cost of these new technologies and the need to be ready to empower customers when costs go up to support new investment this will be critical in maintaining ipls excellent value proposition going forwarddoran we have virtually completed the deployment of our electric smart meters and the associated infrastructure for our customers in  we will begin the process of rolling out a similar system of intelligent meters to our water customers the two metering systems–both provided by elster metering–integrate together significantly reducing the cost of our communications and customer systemsindianapolis power  lightelp what is a typical day for youmurtlow it varies depending on the day but almost every day consists at least in some part of vigorous exercise internal meetings on strategy and operating performance and nonprofit or civic activities i often speak to large groups about the challenges facing our company and its customers such as increasing governmental mandates that will increase costs in the future i also enjoy speaking to groups of corporate executives and college students about leadership my favorite part of the job however is getting out to spend time with folks engaged in their jobs at ipl spending a day with a line crew is a great way to learn their jobs to enhance relationships and to answer questions about the companys strategy and decisionsdoran luckily for me we have a wide range of businesses so my typical day varies continuously in addition to our electrical distribution systems water and wastewater systems and our generation projects we have a significant provincewide commercial metering business an equipment rental business and even a zoo i doubt if many of my peers can say they run a zoo–a zoo that averages more than  visitors a yearelp do you have a mentor or someone you look up to in the industry or has anyone taught you something particularly useful in your role as ceomurtlow my father was obviously a huge mentor early in my life he taught me to question how things worked to debate effectively and that there is no substitute for hard work and honesty at bechtel i was fortunate to work for greg smith a team leader who encouraged me to develop a water treatment expertise and to publish an article on the subject at aes i gained tremendously from my relationship with roger sant one of the founders of aes he has been wildly successful in his career and is one of the smartest most insightful and humblest people one could ever know his leadership style and fundamental beliefs about people inform my leadership style to this day finally at aes i had the opportunity to work with stu ryan who remains a close friend stu taught me that the best way to develop people is to ask probing questions rather than make decisions for them i am the product of the influence of these people and many others who i have the great fortune to be associated with both inside and outside the company and i am deeply grateful for their support in both the past and presentann murtlow chair of womens fund of central indianadoran i believe some of the best advice i ever received was from my first manager at ontario hydro he said it doesnt matter how good your plan a is what matters is how well plans b and c work out when plan a doesntelp how are you involved in your community outside of workmurtlow one of the tenets of our btb operating philosophy is community leadership this means that we work hard not only to support the communities in which we operate with financial donations but we encourage ipl people to be involved in the leadership of organizations that do good work and the company in turn supports their efforts through our giftmatching program i am no exception in

indianapolisbased company which is a leading provider of caps and gowns class photography class rings and educational tools to schools and walker which helps companies solve their business issues through the development and implementation of customerfocused strategies finally i am privileged to serve as a director of the federal reserve bank of chicago particularly during these extraordinary timesone might think these are pretty disparate activities that is by design i get involved in activities that i am passionate about can add value to and from which i can learndoran i have had the opportunity to serve on a variety of community initiatives from hospital boards to youth groups environmental groups and the united wayelp how do you spend your spare timemurtlow i exercise–cardio
