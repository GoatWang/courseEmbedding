design  development regulatory manufacturing news  july   nuvasive to study safety of cervical product nuvasive files ide for cerpass cervical total disc replacement product san diego ca — july   — nuvasive inc announced that it filed for an investigational device exemption ide from the united states food and drug administration fda to investigate the safety and efficacy of its cerpass cervical total disc replacement tdr product on june   as planned approval of the ide from the fda would allow the company to initiate a pivotal human clinical study of the device in the us tdr replaces a damaged or degenerative diseased spinal disc and allows for flexibility in that space by retaining the normal biomechanics of the spine and preserving natural range of motion versus the traditional fusion procedures which replace the disc with implants that bridge the space and facilitate new bone growth to eliminate motion nuvasives cerpass cervical tdr product incorporates a ceramicon ceramic design that the company believes increases durability and eliminates the potential problems of wear debris from other bearing surfaces such as polyethylene in preclinical testing the cerpass compared favorably to other artificial spinal discs currently in fda clinical studies cerpass is also designed to ensure proper placement because of its selfcentering feature cerpass is designed for implantation through an anterior approach to the cervical region of the spine front of the neck alexis v lukianov chairman and chief executive officer said the ide filing for us clinical trials of our cerpass cervical tdr product represents a major milestone in nuvasives artificial disc development efforts for motion preservation of the neck vertebrae we believe the ceramiconceramic design will achieve superior long term wear characteristics compared to that of other bearing surfaces our initial tdr focus continues to be on the cervical region of the spine we believe it offers a more substantial market opportunity and will experience a broader more rapid adoption by spine surgeons particularly when coupled with our selfcentering feature to simplify implantation we plan to discuss the details of the fda study for our cerpass following ide approval source nuvasive like what you are reading sign up for our free newsletter sign me up by clicking sign me up you agree to our terms

products within the companys mastm platform the newly launched products include product category products being launched access systems maxcessr iii retraction system instrument sets redesigned instrument sets for each of the following lumbar fusion procedures  alif anterior lumbar interbody fusion  plif posterior lumbar interbody fusion  tlif transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion  xlifr extreme lateral interbody fusion specialized implants coroentr lx coroent xll and coroent sl maxcess iii is a further enhancement of the companys maxcess and maxcess ii systems with the addition of several features that improve access to the spine maxcess iii maintains the splitblade design and continues to incorporate the companys neurovision nerve avoidance technology within the posterior retraction blade maxcess iii adds a removable fourth blade which provides greater posterior surgical options and incorporates an improved tilted bladelocking mechanism nuvasive also launched a major redesign of its instrument sets for use in all lumbar spine fusion procedures this significant design and engineering effort has resulted in bestinclass instruments a simplified ordering structure and more efficient surgery execution the simplified and logical set configurations have reduced the number of trays required for a specific surgical procedure thus making ordering easier for hospitals in our continued focus on absolute responsiveness to customers the redesigned instrument sets were developed from the companys comprehensive understanding of the many surgical nuances specific to each surgeon and were designed to provide seamless utility with all nuvasive lumbar systems the company launched three new coroent systems providing surgeons with improved anatomical reconstruction characteristics all of the systems are radiolucent giving the surgeon a full view of the patients anatomy during surgery and include radio dense titanium markers enabling the surgeon to visually confirm their correct placement during and after surgery the company has also gained initial clinical experience with the following three products each of which is scheduled for limited release in the fourth quarter of  product category products being launched specialized implants lateral lumbar xlif plate nerve monitoring system neurovisionr enhanced with motor evoked potentials mep capability and neurovision remote monitoringr the lateral lumbar xlif plate is designed for use during the companys proprietary xlif procedure and allows for the placement of a fixation device through the same incision used for placing coroent systems this provides the option to use a plate for fixation through an existing incision rather than utilizing pedicle screws planned neurovision upgrades now incorporate mep technology for complete monitoring of nerve activity in the thoracic and cervical regions of the spine the system also includes numerous software upgrades providing enhanced user interface in addition the company plans to launch neurovision upgrades allowing for remote monitoring providing surgeons the ability to monitor surgeries both intraoperatively and remotely allowing for greater case coverage alexis v lukianov chairman and chief executive officer said the launch of these new products maintains our position at the forefront introducing innovative minimally disruptive spine surgery technologies we are particularly excited about our maxcess iii retractor we believe the enhanced features of this retractor provide surgeons with the maximum amount of access to the patients spine in a safe and reproducible minimally disruptive procedure we expect that this product will continue to stimulate increased use of our innovative implants our instrument set redesign along with our recently announced memphis distribution facility will provide increased speed of delivery to surgeons and unparalleled efficiency to our sales force mr lukianov continued our exclusive sales force continues to gain momentum incorporating our full product line into their territories and achieving deeper penetration into hospitals we continue to believe the combination of this strengthened sales force and our focus on developing innovative products will translate into robust longterm revenue growth the gradient plustm cervical plate system was launched in march of  and offers maximum intraoperative flexibility by providing surgeons with a choice of fixed semiconstrained and dynamic constructs in one system together with the product releases announced today and the releases scheduled for the fourth quarter of  this will complete the companys nine planned product launches for  nuvasive will have all aforementioned products on display during its participation in

parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
