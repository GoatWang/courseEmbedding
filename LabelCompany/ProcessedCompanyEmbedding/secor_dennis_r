everyone i will begin with a few prepared remarks before turning the call over to dennis secor our chief financial officer following his prepared remarks greg mckelvey our chief strategy and digital officer will join us for the qa our results for the quarter while largely in line with our expectations continue to reflect a challenging retail environment and the watch category undergoing significant change the strategies we are pursuing in the midst of these headwinds enable us to better compete in the environment and capitalize on the growing importance of technology to the watch category the newness and the innovation that we are infusing into our fashion accessories is gaining traction with our retail partners and consumers alike demonstrating that technology can be the catalyst needed to drive growth in watches we are very excited about the next generation of products we are developing and launching throughout the year our design technology and engineering expertise were on display at the important basel watch fair where we received a very positive response to our assortment and the improved functionality we believe we are in a position to further expand our leadership position in the fashion accessory space expand our addressable market and improve our financial performance our focus for the year continues to be on executing against our new world fossil restructuring initiative driving growth in our core watch business and advancing our wearable products within an expanded offering across additional brands with wearables we continue to reimagine the watch and its capabilities innovation has always been at the heart of what we do which is what makes this period of disruption in watches a very exciting time for our team we are on track to launch over  skus this year with enhanced engineering that will enable slimmer cases more functionality and brighter screens we are excited to bring five more brands on to our wearables platform including dkny and marc jacobs michele relic and tory burch to the nine other brands we introduced in  our new products for this year will include slimmer and smaller hybrid smartwatches and full round touchscreen smartwatches with custom displays and branded micro apps to create a portfolio of fashionfirst technology accessories within hybrid smartwatches we will introduce new design variations that include increased functional side pushers allowing for various customizable tasks and notifications all of the  brands from our portfolio of wearables will benefit from this enhanced functionality hybrid smartwatches represent an opportunity to reach a new generation of watches wearers and we believe we are uniquely positioned to revolutionize the watch space with these accessories given our depth of brand offerings our  touchscreen smartwatches will see improvements in every way from better screen resolution to smaller cases sizes and branded micro apps enabled by the launch of android wear  our internal software development team has created apps to offer unique functionalities that align with the look and feel of each brand a capability made possible through the acquisition of misfit and the development of our engineering team in addition to updated fossil and michael kors touchscreen watches well expand the offering to emporio armani diesel and misfit which well all launch this fall with the misfit vapor well introduce new features such as optical heart rate monitoring and swimproof functionality our first product to offer those features we continue to broaden our distribution and consumer electronics channels with our new wearables products enabling us to work with new wholesale partners based on the success across the smaller set of stores and the channel during the fourth quarter were working to significantly expand the number of doors we distribute to in the ce channel were moving quickly and reacting to what the consumer is telling us about the new wearable product along those lines we have simplified the pricing for the fossil q assortment offering two price points in hybrids and two price points in display providing an even more competitive and compelling offer for the consumer driving volume and leveraging the scale we bring to the category is enabling us to improve our product costs a goal we communicated coming into the year we are very encouraged by the teams ability to deliver some of these benefits earlier than we originally expected and will continue to drive further progress to provide the right longterm product margins for the category as we shared with you in february with the addition of technology and new functionality in our watches we are expanding our addressable market beyond the single category traditional watch space we once competed in we are now poised to take advantage of the growth in the wearables space while continuing to leverage our competitive strengths in the traditional watch business in order to increase our share in the combined market at the new world fossil we continue to execute against this initiative as we create a leaner and more nimble operating platform capable of better serving our customer and competing in this new retail environment during the first quarter we took expense reduction actions that will better position the organization to support our growthdriving initiatives while focusing fewer resources on areas of the business that are not as high a priority currently we will continue to be disciplined in our approach to managing capital required to navigate new world fossil this is a very broad initiative which demands that we strategically prioritize actions that generate the best returns on our capital investments actions designed to enhance our organizational structure as well as our supply chain an area that can further drive gross margin and profitability improvements over time as we continue to advance our comprehensive plan to evolve our business model for the future we are very pleased with the progress the team has made with what we have accomplished so far we are on target to deliver about  of new world fossils profit enhancement goal this year and the initiatives were driving today should position us to deliver even more against our overall  million goal were very encouraged by the speed with which the organization is adapting to these changes and the commitment shown across the organization to be more disciplined in the way we operate and delivering the expected benefits from this process another area of our business we continue to focus on is driving growth in our own brands this will continue to be a focus for us as we work to further grow fossil and skagen and look for other initiatives that can drive our own revenues first quarter results for both brands reflect a softer wholesale environment and weaker traffic in the retail space however skagen was able to deliver a flat performance in the quarter and fossil declined  both in constant currency fossil declined largely driven by a weaker performance in leathers a category we are working hard to improve with upcoming design improvements our wearables product continues to perform well and we have initiatives in the pipeline to further grow that portion of the business in addition to the pricing changes i mentioned earlier in traditional watches we are continuing to innovate and have identified several trends that we are distorting you will also see fossil launching a new media campaign with an emphasis on social digital and print marketing utilizing authentic brand ambassadors these ambassadors were strategically chosen to introduce the fossil q product to a wide range of ages and prospective watch wearers while staying true to the brand heritage in closing our entire team is very energized by the challenge in front of us and focused on growing our core watch business through innovation and leveraging our core competitive strengths all of our strategic advantages continue to make us the leader in our space and differentiate us from many of our competitors as we actively seek to add new brands to further enhance our portfolio with technology and innovation we have strengthened our position and we believe we are on the right track to improve our financial performance see significant growth in our wearables business this year as the products grow to represent a much larger percent of our business and we remain confident in our strategic priorities and the initiatives we are pursuing given their ability to positively impact our results and drive longterm shareholder value we will continue to expand our addressable market with successful wearable product launches that leverage our proven design and branding expertise further establishing our leadership position in the fashion accessories space and now i would like to turn the call over to dennis for additional color on our financial performance as youll hear we are adjusting our outlook for the year primarily given further pressure on gross margin due to promotional activity in our outlet channel the retail landscape is very challenging right now while we are very focused on our longterm strategies and the opportunities they represent we are mindful of the need to balance those with the nearterm challenges in the business we are focused on this and have not lost sight of the importance of striking that balance dennis dennis r secor  fossil group inc thanks kosta and good afternoon everyone our first quarter results were largely inline with our expectations as constant currency net sales decreased  and on a reported basis decreased to  million during the quarter we continued to advance our strategy in wearables driving significant growth in the category particularly smartwatches which helped to mitigate the decline in traditional watches that decline combined with the continued softness in leathers resulted in sales at the lower end of our expectations for the quarter we delivered results within our range of expectations and reported a net loss per share of  including restructuring charges of  per share compared to earnings of  last year the decline compared to last year was primarily driven by lower sales and gross margins and restructuring charges mitigated partially by lower operating expenses first quarter loss per share was positively impacted by  due to changes in foreign currency with a strong us dollar negatively impacting our sales and operating margins however operating gains from hedging activity more than offset that negative impact on a yearoveryear comparison the impact from currency was essentially neutral given last years  positive impact from nonoperating contract gains to recap the quarters sales performance as we expected we had a tough comparison in the first quarter given q of  saw greater sellin across our brands and channels in addition the consolidation of our retail store fleet also contributed to our sales decline as we operated with roughly  fewer stores compared to last years first quarter wearables represented  of our sales across product categories and over  of those sales came from smartwatches significantly impacting the trend in the watch category for our key brands for michael kors while watch sales did decline in the quarter once again smartwatches positively impacted overall watch trends for the brand by doubledigit fossil declined  in constant dollars compared to last year mainly driven by leathers despite a low singledigit decline in watches smartwatches had a significantly positive impact on the watch category for the brand nearly offsetting the entire decline in traditional watches skagen sales were flat compared to last year with all categories performing similarly in the retail channel comp store sales including ecomm sales which grew  for the quarter declined  due to further deceleration in traffic trends in our retail stores now from a regional perspective in the americas first quarter sales decreased  to  million with traditional watches and leathers driving the decline declines across all the brands in the portfolio were driven by decreases in traditional watches primarily offset by connected watches with our strongest performance coming from michael kors access both wholesale and retail sales declined at similar rates in the quarter in europe reported sales decreased  to  million a  constant dollar decrease our relatively flat performance in jewelry and watches with declines in traditional watches offset by connected watches was offset by a decline in leathers within the region continued growth in skagen and increases in armani exchange and michael kors were offset by declines in the other brands in the portfolio modest growth in spain was offset by declines in the uk and middle east with both the wholesale and retail channels decreasing across the region in asia sales decreased  to  million with declines in watches led by traditional watches and leathers driving the decrease growth in india and china was offset by a decline in japan and australia in the quarter gross profit decreased to  million and gross margin declined  basis points to  lower margin in the retail channel primarily due to increased promotions to drive sales in our outlets and online as well as a higher mix of connected products which currently deliver lower margins were the biggest drivers of the decline the negative impact of changes in foreign currencies and an increase in the relative mix of off price sales which were flat to last year also contributed to the decline international mix partially offset those headwinds did as the initial benefits we are seeing from our new world fossil initiatives and we expect those improvements to expand as we move throughout the year first quarter operating expenses were  million or  of sales and included  million of restructuring costs associated with realigning and optimizing our organizational structure plus store closure cost primarily in the americas excluding those items expenses were significantly lower compared to the first quarter of last year as we begin to realize the initial benefits of new world fossil marketing expenses were also lower than a year ago as we shifted marketing investments to the second and third quarters to better create awareness and support our significant wearables rollout this year our first quarter operating loss was  million driven by lower sales in gross margins expenses were flat as reductions in our ongoing operating expenses offset the  million impact of restructuring charges first quarter other income increased roughly  million to  million due to more favorable foreign currency activity interest expense increased roughly  million due to higher interest rates our effective income tax rate for the quarter was roughly  compared to last years  due to changes in tax accounting rules and jurisdictional earnings while we had anticipated a small tax charge in the quarter we ultimately recorded a small benefit primarily due to our updated estimate for restructuring charges this year which i will address shortly now turning to our cash flows and balance sheet during the quarter we generated operating cash flow of  million invested  million in capex and reduced borrowings by  million we improved our net debt position by roughly  million compared to a year ago we ended the quarter with roughly  million in cash compared to  million last year and debt of  million compared to  million a year ago inventory levels at the end of the first quarter were down  with traditional watch inventories down substantially enabling us to both invest in wearables inventories to drive growth while also reducing our overall investment in inventory accounts receivable increased by  to roughly  million and wholesale dsos increased by  days compared to the prior year due to timing and shifts in customer mix depreciation and amortization expense totaled  million for the quarter during the quarter we amended and extended our credit agreement with our banks this amendment extends the facility until may  and among other things provides us with greater covenant flexibility during our peak working capital periods the amendment also included a higher fee structure which we had already anticipated were pleased to have the support of our banking partners as we work through the transformation of our business and navigate a challenging retail environment lets now move to our outlook with the first quarter now behind us were updating our outlook for the year to reflect our experience and learning from the first quarter let me start with our operational results and then later give an update on our new world fossil restructuring investments so on operations let me start with our traditional business in our traditional business while sales continued to decline first quarter sales were modestly stronger than we had planned going into the quarter we are experiencing an intensifying competitive environment mainly in our outlets and international concessions necessitating a greater use of promotions to drive sales in our stores as we compete for consumer spending this put more pressure on gross margins particularly in the second half of the quarter we were able to mitigate some of that pressure though by further containing expenses but not enough to fully mitigate the margin headwind we expect this promotional trend to carry throughout the balance of the year which is reflected in our updated guidance next in wearables while we increased sales by nearly  compared to last year our selling plans were short of our initial plans for the quarter in the quarter we also continued working with our licensed partners and now have better visibility into our distribution plans for  with our ambitious plans we dont expect we will get all the distribution we had initially anticipated in place this year though with the expansion of wearables across a larger portion of our brand portfolio we continue to expect that we could roughly triple our penetration of wearables revenues which represented roughly  of last year sales from an earnings perspective while were adjusting the upper end of our sales expectations to reflect our updated distribution plans we dont expect a significant impact to earnings based on the greater visibility we now have into our wearable supply chain and product costing and our first quarter wearables margins we expect that our wearables margins will be stronger than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year based on these factors we are updating our annual sales expectations in the range between down  and  both of which include roughly a  point currency headwind we expect our sales growth rates to improve sequentially throughout the year as we rollout more brands on to our wearables platform progressively throughout the year next to gross margins we continue to plan that overall gross margins will be down compared to last year given currency headwinds and the impact of wearables margins on our mix we are updating our expectations to reflect further headwinds due to the promotional retail environment mainly for traditional watches given our betterthanplanned wearables cost we do expect that the mix impact from wearables will not be as severe as we had initially expected moving to expenses coming out of our first quarter our team has identified further areas where we can reduce operating costs gaining greater efficiencies in our operational processes including accelerating some of our new world fossil cost benefits into  our goal is to use these further cost reductions to mitigate anticipated gross margin pressures for the remainder of the year though we do not expect that we will be able to fully offset these further margin headwinds this year for the full year excluding restructuring charges we continue to expect to operate with substantially lower expenses throughout the year after restructuring charges weve updated our plans for the year to focus  investments on activities that deliver nearterm cash payback as a result were now planning to defer some of our planned store closures and now expect total  restructuring charges of roughly  million  million of which we expect to incur in the second quarter overall for the year we expect total expenses to be lower than last year and we expect to operate with the total expense rate that is flat to down compared to last year we now expect to operate with an operating margin between  and  which includes roughly a  basis point headwind related to currencies we now expect fullyear earnings per share in the range between a loss of  per share and earnings of  per share these updated expectations include a  restructuring charge which is  lower than our previous expectations given our adjustment and expected restructuring charges and variability and jurisdictional mix our guidance now assumes a tax rate in the low  range at the lower end and the low  range at the upper end and we have adjusted our guidance to reflect this change we continue to assume higher interest expense this year compared to a year ago given our financing activities and assuming exchange rates remain at prevailing levels based on our other expectations wed expect nonoperating currency net benefits roughly similar to last years levels based on our current estimates as we move into the back half of the year we expect our earnings to sequentially improve we continue to expect gross margin pressures to be strongest in the third quarter given the greatest yearoveryear change in connected mix relative to last year we continue to expect that our planned shift of greater advertising investments into the third quarter will likely dampen the earnings benefit of our anticipated wearables growth and we also continue to expect that expense timing to turn in the fourth quarter when we expect to generate a substantial majority of this years earnings for the second quarter we expect sales to decline in the range between  and  which includes roughly a  basis point currency headwind we expect operating margin in the range between negative  to negative  and a loss per share in the range between  and  which includes a restructuring charge of  per share let me take a moment to talk about liquidity and cash flow with the amendments we made to our credit facility we have additional flexibility to operate during our peak working capital periods our recent declines in ebitda are putting additional pressure on our available capital however with our new facility now in place we expect that it coupled with our cash generation will provide us with sufficient resources to manage throughout the year and over the life of the facility as a management team we are highly focused on managing our capital carefully and prudently and are working to improve our position we are now refocusing both our capex and our restructuring investments on those initiatives that drive nearterm cash returns we have opportunities to monetize a modest level of international unencumbered assets were continuing to drive our investments in inventory down ending q with nearly  million less inventory than we had a year ago and we are focused on other areas to optimize our investment in working capital our goal for the year is to generate overall free cash flow similar to last years  million there are headwinds against that goal the biggest of which are lower operating earnings and higher interest rates at our higher level of expectations those represent roughly an  million headwind including our restructuring investments and the effects of currencies we have significant offsets to those headwinds based on our updated plans well deploy  million less capex than last year given this years lower earnings we expect well pay roughly  million less in taxes this year and our goal is to leverage our efforts to manage working capital in inventory and in other areas to bridge the gap we expect that our cash build this year will primarily be in international markets while it remains our goal to reduce our debt position that will be challenging this year given that the majority of our restructuring investments will require us cash limiting our ability to repay our debt which is us based therefore we continue to expect to end the year with a relatively similar debt position as last year our ability to generate cash flow remains strong even in a disruptive environment our net debt position currently roughly  million improved  million in fiscal  and we expect it to substantially improve again this year our capital challenges are twofold first the majority of our cash flow was generated overseas which creates a substantial tax consequence to fully use that cash to repay existing us debt secondly given that our debt is concentrated with banks our availability is a significant function of our historical ebitda which has been recently declining including a significant impact from currencies we remain focused on solutions to mitigate these issues including diversifying our capital structure both in terms of markets and tenor and with that well open up the call to your questions please limit yourself to one singlepart question so that we can get to everyone and give them a chance to ask a question if you have further questions please requeue and well get to as many questions as time permits questionandanswer session operator our first question is from ed yruma of keybanc capital markets your line is open edward j yruma  pacific crest securities hey guys thanks for taking my question i know you indicated that sellin on wearables was a little bit short of plans i guess any specificity there would be helpful i know you gave some color around the fossil lift for wearables but how did the michael kors wearable performance shake out and was some of the weaker sellin due to the potential for orders that maybe got pushed out toward the back end of the year thank you gregory a mckelvey  fossil group inc yes well talk about wearables performance on three levels sales margins and product delivery for sales we mentioned q was below budget still strong growth of over  and was  of our total sales if you look at the factors for why underbudget were determining that wearables are a bit more of a seasonal business than traditional watches so we should expect our mix to be a bit lower than in the front end of the year and higher as a percent of total business in the back half we ended up pushing out a lot of our marketing in q so theres very limited marketing and most of that is now aligned against fossil and kors and the other brands that were launching in q and q and then it took a bit longer to solidify our expanded distribution through license or approval so those are now largely in place and aligned with our updated sales goals through the year so thats the summary nothing specific around kors those products are still performing very well and for the rest of performance on wearables margins are coming in better so as you know weve been – i mentioned on the last call relentlessly working with our supply base on driving cost out those plans arent fully solidified but weve got line of sight to those margins improvements accruing sooner than we had originally forecasted and then q was – has been a significant amount of work as well on delivering on all of the product launches for the back half of the year which remain on track edward j yruma  pacific crest securities thanks so much operator thank you our next question is from omar saad of evercore isi your line is open omar saad  evercore group llc thank you i wanted to ask a followup on the wearables category could you talk about your inventory mix and how you are planning the business traditional fashion watches versus wearables where you stand now where you expect that to be later in the year and at retail is there still a lot of traditional fashion watch inventory that needs to be worked through thats driving the promotions that are pressuring the gross margins a little bit as you try to kind of clear the desk for all the wearable launches in the second half thanks dennis r secor  fossil group inc yeah no i would say we – you heard us say on the call our inventories are down  the team here has been really focused on managing that well within that  decline weve been able to significantly invest in wearables which is going to drive our growth and reduce our investments in the traditional business so were accomplishing a number of objectives both in terms of positioning us well for growth and managing our capital we think that the inventories are very clean weve been reducing those inventories significantly our clearance this quarter was roughly flat to last – or a year ago rather which has put some – a little bit of a headwind into the margins but very pleased with the inventory position were coming out of the quarter with gregory a mckelvey  fossil group inc in discounting youre seeing omar is what we actually referenced in our last call where weve got sharp opening price points to drive volume particularly on fossil youll continue to see that sharp price points with steppedup marketing and dramatically improved process i think thats the right recipe to drive this business omar saad  evercore group llc got it thanks good luck kosta n kartsotis  fossil group inc thank you operator thank you our next question is from oliver chen of cowen  company your line is open oliver chen  cowen and company llc hi thank you as we look ahead when should we expect the decline in traditional watches to stop or grow in terms of will the compares ease or are you feeling like theres the initiatives youre putting forward will start to drive demand or will that decline for the foreseeable future and on the wearables side can you just brief us on the marketplace because im feeling like theres a lot of promotional intensity that could be out of your control in the marketplace so how will you manage margins in that context and what can you do to try to manage a healthy demand profile on some items in terms of making sure that the margin march happens over time thank you dennis r secor  fossil group inc sure let me take the first part of that in terms of the sales trajectory weve said for a while that our biggest challenge is really nearterm visibility you go back to last year and we were fundamentally operating in a declining market when we were only operating in the traditional watch market and coming out of the fourth quarter when we had a strong showing of our wearables performance were now in a growing wrist device market that is plus bigger than that standalone traditional watch market and that growth in that combined wrist device market is being fueled by connected watches but we dont yet have all of our brands on their platform we havent fully developed the distribution for connected so were still in the earlier phases of that part of the evolution so the nearterm challenge is continuing to try to sequence the growth in connected against the headwinds in traditional connected again in the first quarter which as greg mentioned is probably the least impactful quarter given the seasonality of that product but it did drive doubledigit improvement in the trajectories of kors very nearly the same in fossil so were still seeing that wearables can be the catalyst to drive growth in the category but specifically for  the first quarter was our toughest compare remember we had last year sellin that we were up against weve got fewer stores we got currencies but we do expect as we bring more connected on to the platform that see accelerating growth our second quarter guide is a sequential improvement to the first and we expect that to accelerate as we move through the back half of the year gregory a mckelvey  fossil group inc and more specifically on your point around discounting and how were seeing the market on hybrids i guess i responded to this with omar and this is really about our – the price points that our elasticity curves are telling us drive volumes were then translated into lower cost which hit the margin profile were looking for the year out of q were doing better than we thought were getting cost out even further and so were on hybrids feeling good about our ability to continue to grow that business profitably and thats really our own – theres nobody else driving the significant scale in that category like we are on the smartwatch i think the indicators we look for there is that were still seeing very strong sellthrough for our higher price point products with michael kors and the access watch we dont have significant discounting on those were still seeing that and then were again intentionally using a high low strategy on fossil to drive strong opening price points and volume so we are – i think performing well in the marketplace and are effectively on track for our margin expectations kosta n kartsotis  fossil group inc i would just add that were perceiving significantly demand in wearables if you look at idcs latest research it shows that the smartwatch business last year was about  billion on its way to  billion by  and we are – through our new distribution through ce channels and all our existing distribution were seeing pretty significant demand out there that bodes well for our future in wearables dennis r secor  fossil group inc you know to kind of punctuate that we still believe very strongly what we said last time in terms of the longterm that we have the opportunity to drive back to operating margins in those lowteens driven by three major initiatives to return to a modest level of growth and we think connected is showing us that we have the opportunity to do that weve got to deliver new world fossil and we are well on our way to delivering the  part of that and connected margins was the third and you heard greg say that we have advanced the ball faster against that initiative this year already so we certainly continue to believe that that is an achievable goal for us oliver chen  cowen and company llc thanks for that thats great kosta n kartsotis  fossil group inc thank you operator thank you our next question is from erinn murphy of piper jaffray your line is open erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co great thanks good afternoon just a question on wholesale partner destocking has that – traditional watches – has that trend accelerated is it flat sequentially or is it still declining and then i guess just yesterday with coachs announcement of the acquisition of kate spade does that change anything with the licensing relationship you have with kate i just dont know if theres change in control in that license that could impact i think its through  so just curious on that thanks dennis r secor  fossil group inc sure on the wholesale business i mean overall our traditional business performed pretty much in line with our expectations overall we were a little bit stronger than we anticipated in the international market a little bit behind in the us but not a material change in the trajectory so we had expected this and as we – again we delivered our sales in fact into the overall traditional watch business we were actually a little bit ahead of our goals for the quarter kosta n kartsotis  fossil group inc and as for kate spade as you mentioned we have a contract with them through  and we are looking forward to working closely with the kate spade team and were launching wearables this year in kate spade the brand has been very successful on our portfolio we think its got a longterm future that could be very significant so looking forward to working with the new team erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co and so theres no issue with change in control with coach now being the owner of kate and just know how that looked kosta n kartsotis  fossil group inc no theres no change of control either way in the contract erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co okay and then if i could just sneak one in on leathers it was pretty challenging in the quarter down  could you just elaborate what you are seeing and its been obviously a very promotional category for several brands out there but kind of how should we think about that trend throughout the balance of the year thank you kosta n kartsotis  fossil group inc yes i think its several things first of all id say weve had some product misses in our own assortment and weve been working with a design consultant thats been very helpful were kind of changing the entire profile of it weve got a lot of new ideas new materials and were actually going to do some pretesting of all those things on consumer panels online consumer panels so were going out at it with a totally new approach the other thing as you mentioned i think the business has been tough overall i think the latest npd numbers for fourth quarter show that i think the total handbag business in united states was down  so the markets tough but we do think that with our position and our own stores and website were going to be able to have an opportunity longterm as we change the product and go after one thing we are seeing i think from our q is were seeing a younger customer come into our store to buy wearable technology i think we can leverage that into handbags so were looking forward to improving the business and moving forward with a larger opportunity in handbags erinn e murphy  piper jaffray  co thank you operator thank you our next question is from simeon siegel of nomurainstinet your line is open simeon avram siegel  nomura securities thanks good afternoon guys can you quantify any cannibalization you may or may not be seeing wearable versus traditionals dennis i think when you said tripling wearables any way to quantify how much would be incremental volume versus maybe a transfer from the traditional and then just how do you view the sales trajectory of the wearable and traditionals over this year embedded within your guide thanks gregory a mckelvey  fossil group inc okay on cannibalization i think theres four things to frame first off we dont give exact cannibalization numbers but four ways to think about it one were seeing the right consumer dynamics so smartwatches in particular despite smartwatches are in general a new customer thats coming in and theyre highquality customer so were seeing generally younger higher average basket size so a lot of incrementality there on hybrids generally its an existing traditional watch customer but theres a willingness to pay for more features and trade up to a higher average unit retail product second were seeing significant comp improvements from wearables so it tells us there is significant amount of incrementality overall third were in this relentless pursuit to drive cost down quickly to get to the point where were not going to care as cannibalization occurs because were selling higher average unit retail products at good enough margin to the point where its accretive wherever the customer goes and where weve got line of sight to getting there and then fourth we have with these differentiated products that are difficult to do with any reasonable scale with true branding and design like were doing on a global basis with those advantages we believe that we are not only transforming our business and unit volume in total but we are competing in a much larger addressable market and well be taking share significant share over time in both traditional watches and our expanded addressable market that includes wearables dennis r secor  fossil group inc yes and just on the progression then through the year traditional versus connected the way we see that as i mentioned just a minute ago the traditional business overall as a portfolio but generally performs a little bit ahead of our expectations as we sort of trended out we see sort of the upper end of our guidance there was existing trends were seeing sort of persisting very modest initiatives that we can capitalize and some emerging trends that were seeing and then at the lower end we make an assumption that we see a further stepdown in those historical trends beyond what weve already seen and observed in our historical data so thats sort of a general assumption around the traditional business on the connected business its much more of an accelerated growth what were seeing – the things to think about – were talking about increasing our penetration significantly in wearables this year thats going to be more backloaded were seasonalizing the business that we have during the first quarter were opening a lot of new doors this year were bringing new brands on to the platform more display watches were assuming that we are going to see some better performance we got better product coming in the market slimmer product which is going to attract new consumers better technology there continues to be enhanced awareness around the category thats being held by the competition as well as the investments that were making in marketing better price product assortment sharper price points and in fact some of the recent data just published suggest that the wearables market is actually likely to be larger this year than last year the latest estimate went from  billion to  billion in  so theres a lot of work to be done but theres a lot of fuel in the tank to drive those numbers kosta n kartsotis  fossil group inc and its really the investment in innovation and in our experience innovation always drives sales results and gets consumers excited in wrist devices if you look at the overall watch business last year it was minus  and were in a situation now where theres  billion colliding  wearables and watches together its a very exciting prospect to bring new consumers in there that may have not worn a watch before and to really disrupt the industry with innovation we think is very exciting dennis r secor  fossil group inc yes and just to complete the point on how were thinking about guidance so what i described in connected more aligns with the upper end of our range and then there is obviously execution risk theres a lot of stuff to get done so the lower end of our range assumes we dont fully execute everything in that plan simeon avram siegel  nomura securities okay thanks very helpful and then if i can just for quick clarification to your point about the balance sheet do you expect the incremental interest to go away this year or does that recur and then just can you help anything that you are embedding for the other income line within the full year and the q guides dennis r secor  fossil group inc the interest – so with the new amended and extended facility we had anticipated already in this year that there will be a higher interest so we already embedded that into our guidance there is an acceleration feature as we move through time one later this year and then another next year whether it would be a further increase in interest expense thats subject to – that would kick in if we dont pay down the existing  million term loan that we have outstanding today and then with respect to the other – what we did say in the prepared remarks is that based on all of our assumptions in the current exchange rate environment that the net below the line kind of currency activity should be roughly similar to last year simeon avram siegel  nomura securities great thanks a lot guys best of luck for the rest of the year gregory a mckelvey  fossil group inc thank you operator thank you our next question is from anna andreeva of oppenheimer your line is open anna andreeva  oppenheimer  co inc great thanks so much couple of questions for us i guess on wearables can you elaborate what distribution you guys werent able to get during the quarter was that us or international and should we think this is mostly across the ce channel or at department stores and i guess are you expecting a catchup in distribution as we go through the year and then secondly you mentioned there was a marketing expenses shift out of q into q and q what was the dollar amount thanks kosta n kartsotis  fossil group inc we actually slowed down our distribution of wearables to some locations early this year basically because we didnt – we were low on stock on our bestselling styles we were chasing those and we didnt feel its prudent to really to go to a lot of new distribution until we had the full assortment including the bestselling stock so weve largely corrected that so a lot of thats going out right now so we do expect that we will have a very significant additional distribution this year not only through our existing channel but through ce channels websites et cetera so were getting into position to quantify that year last year with the first quarter being the real first initial push for wearables that we had a concentration a significant amount of our marketing investment that landed in the fourth quarter this year we see the timing were investing less in the first greg just explained that to you more in the second launches coming into the late second and early third more in the third relative to last year and then that turned into fourth so you see the concentration moving away yearoveryear from the first into fourth to the second and the third we didnt quantify that one other comment id make on advertising is that as we mentioned weve done a great job i think of reducing sga including the fact that weve absorbed all our misfit and wearables expenses into our sga and still have a smaller number but we largely have not touched advertising our advertising is still going out pretty much the same that we had last couple of years a lot of it is focused on wearables and not just at all types of media but also a lot of training point of sale and a lot of additional distribution et cetera so our marketing largely has not been affected as much as some of our other expenses operator thank you our next question is from dana telsey of telsey advisory group your line is open dana telsey  telsey advisory group good afternoon everyone as you think about and you chatted about the accelerating promotional environment can you just qualitatively are you seeing that across all channels is it more one category than another and what drove the acceleration more recently is it less traffic what are you seeing out there to put your arms around it thank you dennis r secor  fossil group inc yes where we saw it principally was in our outlets which has been a trend for the last several quarters  operator sir you may respond to the question now kosta n kartsotis  fossil group inc can you please repeat the question operator can you please repeat the question operator yes sir dana telseys line is still open gregory a mckelvey  fossil group inc dana would you like to repeat your question please well come back to that one operator dana telsey  telsey advisory group hi can you hear me gregory a mckelvey  fossil group inc we can thank you dana dana telsey  telsey advisory group oh good i was just asking about as you think about the different channels and the promotional levels what are you seeing by channel is it different by channel is it different by category with this accelerating promotions and whats changed more recently thank you dennis r secor  fossil group inc yes i dont think the trend has continued i think its just the intensity the level of promotion that we need to execute to drive the sales so i think it is just another symptom of the same issue thats been recurring its always difficult to technical difficulty  –  operator you can speak sir dennis r secor  fossil group inc we havent heard a question after danas operator yes sir our next question is from randy konik of jefferies your line is open randal j konik  jefferies llc can you hear me now dennis r secor  fossil group inc we can randal j konik  jefferies llc hey guys how are you so thanks for taking my question i know theres some technical difficulties here i feel like a lot of the call has been focused on the wearable product evolution which i think is great although right now its obviously only  of the business so just kind of what – how can we get comfort i think what the markets looking for is how do we kind of think about the traditional watch business and where those unit volumes kind of start to bottom out and why and kind of walk us through your thought process on that scenario and then i guess just a followup around distribution it sounded like you said like look were looking to more ce channels et cetera and you did a good job of reducing your store count i guess what im trying to get towards is what does the distribution footprint need to look like as the product strategy is morphed and the market itself is changed so im just trying to get some help on that traditional watch market where does it stabilize i think thats the most important part of the story and then just the distribution angle around it thanks kosta n kartsotis  fossil group inc well as we mentioned before one of the issues we have is the lack of visibility and exactly when well see the bottom in the traditional watch business just overall our number one objective is to continue to gain share in the watch business we just think the way to do that right now is with technology so we have identified several trends in traditional watches that we are distorting right now to go after it but the biggest trend that were going after which is clear to us and the demand is all there is in wearables so if you take our existing distribution where the stores that we sell to have all embraced the idea of wearable technology they still have a big business obviously in traditional watches and were putting new materials and new ideas and new thoughts in there as we migrate towards a larger number of wearables it is bringing younger customers in the store largely havent worn watches before so were starting to see more relevancy in the watch business in addition to that weve expanded to sell to ce channel which are – most of those ce channels are selling display smartwatches and hybrids and were seeing very good sales across the board in that channel so i would say the entire industry is really seeing the two businesses collide wearables and traditional watches its giving us additional channels its giving our existing distribution additional customers coming into the store and its giving us a larger addressable market so i think all in all we just got to play through it we do not have the visibility and when the traditional watch business will level off but what we do know is when we have wearables in a certain brand whether its kors or fossil that the comps are dramatically different when we have wearables and traditional watches in the same environment and that we think will accelerate as time goes on randal j konik  jefferies llc and then just may i ask then dennis when you gave the annual revenue guidance or the updated revenue guidance for the year is there a way we can get the assumption of what the traditional watch business is assumed to be declining at and how that compares to the first quarter trend dennis r secor  fossil group inc well weve given you the overall – the watch decline in the release we havent disclosed the specifics around traditional versus connected but again the way we view just the trends on that traditional business is to continue at a decline at the pace weve been seeing on the upper end and then at the lower end to expect some level of further erosion that is largely the big part of the change in the – or the width of the range theres really two risks identified in that range its that further step down in the traditional business and then execution risk in delivering our connected agenda this year randal j konik  jefferies llc understood thank you dennis r secor  fossil group inc you bet operator thank you our next question is from ike boruchow of wells fargo your line is open ike boruchow  wells fargo securities llc hey sorry guys can you hear me dennis r secor  fossil group inc we can ike boruchow  wells fargo securities llc sorry about that i just wanted to go back to the question that simeon asked about cannibalization i mean the only reason i want to ask you again is clearly the macro is tough out there but the traditional watch business took a pretty – it took a big step back in q and its kind of remained in that run rate in q and that coincides with the launch of wearables so im just kind of curious like whatever work youve done around cannibalization within the traditional watch business can you share anything with us because im really trying to understand if you sell more wearables are you sure that youre cannibalizing your high margin existing watch business while you do that and scale that business just how do you balance both of those businesses together given the different margin dynamics dennis r secor  fossil group inc yes i mean – lets see we dont have specific data that were able to share with you but i mean one way to look at it is kind of refer to what i said earlier about the change in the market so up until last year we were operating the market that was declining because we were limited to that traditional watch market there were other choices that consumers could make in terms of technology our challenge was we couldnt get that customer the other choice that the customer was making we did not benefit it so in a certain sense you might say that over the last couple of years really arguably into the back half of last year we were being – using the term loosely sort of cannibalized by others in the marketplace now we are in a position early stages though because we dont have all of our brands in the platform but now we are in a position to take advantage of that preference from some of the consumers moving away from traditional watches into connected watches and that we believe will grow as we bring more products into the market as we bring better products into the market more brands into the market expand our distribution we will be in a better position to win that customer when a year ago when we didnt have – we virtually had no offering in connect so we didnt win that weve changed our competitive position significantly in the last  months ike boruchow  wells fargo securities llc thank you operator thank you our last question is from heather balsky of bank of america your line is open heather n balsky  bank of america merrill lynch hi thank you for taking my question i was wondering if you could just talk about new world fossil and just remind us what is the split of the  million of operating margin opportunity in terms of sga and the benefit to gross margin and then you talked about accelerating some of the cost benefits into  what are those benefits that you think you can accelerate thanks dennis r secor  fossil group inc sure so we havent specifically broken out all the components but what we said is that our goal was to invest initially we thought it would be about  million in restructuring charges that will likely be lower as weve reduced some of the store closure plans but that was largely then to drive a portfolio of improvements that will go into a number of buckets the total of which is roughly  million and it included optimizing and gaining efficiencies in our infrastructure and our organizational structure improving our ability to leverage our volumes in both our direct and indirect sourcing designing with a better view to the feature set that a customer was willing to pay for to ultimately eliminate features that just add costs but really dont motivate the consumer to buy and then focusing on category management more tightly looking at our sku counts reducing them and become much more efficient with the way we build our product plant so that whole portfolio is designed to deliver roughly  million of profit improvements over the life of the program the core organization is laserfocused on this we did a lot of work last year and much of that work is going to drive the benefit that were seeing in  based on the way weve measured we think that we will deliver that  of that goal in  and then some of the margin benefits take a little longer to cycle through because you have to deal with the design calendars and production calendars before those benefits actually flow through a pl but we think weve made a lot of progress and were on good track to deliver heather n balsky  bank of america merrill lynch great thank you and just one quick question in terms of your wholesale sales in terms of department store closures how much of an impact do you think you saw in the first quarter and how are you thinking about the rest of the year kosta n kartsotis  fossil group inc i would say its relatively small as you know were closing some of the small doors were seeing some of those sales obviously migrate to online and we dont really expect through this year to be a significant number in addition to that of course were adding a lot of additional distribution that will offset some of that so we dont think its a big impact to us heather n balsky  bank of america merrill lynch okay thank you very much operator thank you at this time id like to turn it back to mr secor for closing remarks
