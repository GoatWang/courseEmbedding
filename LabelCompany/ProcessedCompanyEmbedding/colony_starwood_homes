performance finally arik prawer our chief financial officer will highlight a very active quarter of capital markets and balance sheet activities as we enter our second year as colony starwood homes we are focused on identifying and implementing additional operating efficiencies cultivating acquisition growth channels and enhancing our technology platform to further improve our customer experience employee and vendor productivity and to enable additional revenue opportunities we also expect  to be a year of expanding our capital base through external growth and continued strengthening of our balance sheet fundamental to the singlefamily rental business remained very favorable our first quarter operating results reflect continued strong demand for our high quality rental homes in our concentrated high growth markets we continue to see no sign of meaningful additions of a supply home buying remains stable at low levels and the leading edge of the maturing millennial cohort should provide a swelling wave of singlefamily rental demand for years to come at the end of the first quarter occupancy in our same home portfolio of nearly  homes stood at  up from the fourth quarter mark of  yearoveryear samestore revenue grew by  supported by core rental revenue growth of  and amplified by an increase utility reimbursements as we implement our utility billing conversion for water sewer and trash services our total yearoveryear same home expense growth reflect our recent utility billing conversion and are impacted by comp period factors stemming from the closing of our merger in the first quarter of  while absorbing these corresponding yearoveryear growth impacts our same home core noi margin expanded  basis points yearoveryear to  with seven of our markets achieving margins greater than  during the first quarter in q same home noi grew by  charles will discuss these metrics in more detail as part of his remarks through the first quarter we purchased  homes for a total investment of  million or about  per home these acquisitions consisted of  single asset purchases totaling  million  million in build the rent deliveries of  new homes and  million in small portfolio acquisitions totaling  homes our acquisition activity continues to be concentrated in nashville charlotte phoenix denver and dallas during the quarter our portfolio optimization continued with disposition of  assets for  million our external growth pipeline remains encouraging and we expect it to grow further as we enter the more robust summer selling season  has been a very busy year so far in terms of capital market activities eric and his team has executed extraordinarily well on several fronts the highlight of these activities was our debut primary equity offering  million in conjunction with  million secondary sales by our original sponsors this highly successful transaction provides additional capitals to support external growth and further strengthen our balance sheet another milestone event for the company subsequent to the first quarter was the closing of a new  million corporate credit facility replacing the two legacy credit lines the colony american homes and starwood waypoint brought into the merger as superior indiscernible and costs arik will provide more detail on these events and other capital market activities during the first quarter based on the continued support of favorable demographic trends limited supply solid first quarter results and encouraging operating indicators leading into the peak leasing season we expect another year of solid results and progress we are proud of our accomplishments to date confident in our ability to achieve operational excellence and optimistic about the long term future prospects of the singlefamily rental space charles will now review our operational results for the quarter charles young thanks fred and good morning everyone on todays call i will provide some detail on the drivers of our operating results and highlight conditions in our markets for the first quarter of  occupancy rates at quarter end was  for our stabilized portfolio of  homes as well as our same home portfolio of  homes which is the highest occupancy percentage we have reported to date this consistency across portfolios is a testament to our teams ability to manage the steady flow of homes we are acquiring in several markets quickly get the homes ready and lease them to quality residents during the period same home explorations increased  to  of the which  were renewed and  were retained both improvements over q of  same home turnover for the quarter was low at  of the portfolio or  annualized we had  renewals commenced during the quarter at a growth rate of  northern california leading the way at  and tampa came in on the low end of the range at  we had  new leases commenced in the quarter at a growth rate of  with northern california again out in front at  which is in the lowest market of scale at negative  overall our same home blended rent growth for q with  as weve noted before replacement rents are seasonally lower in q and q and we expect replacement rents to outpace renewals in q in fact april replacement rents were already outpacing renewals at  to  blending to  for the month asking renewal rents for q are averaging around  which indicates another summer of strong demand for singlefamily rental homes combining rental income and continued strong growth of fee income total same home revenue was up  versus the same period last year we continue to see strong demand for our product with over  leads for available homes generated by our marketing platform during the period which is an average of  lead per marketed home the highest we have seen yet this demand drove healthy rent growth and a  reduction in our moveouts and movein timeline versus the same period last year the number of days a home spent vacant has been reduced by compressing turn timelines as well as completing roughly twothirds of our showings to prospective residents using our smart home technology platform allowing them to tour our homes while having to schedule in advance with a leasing consultant in addition to reducing average days without revenue our smart home offering is now generating ancillary revenue as residents utilize the smart home product during a residency currently one out of every two new residents are subscribed to the smart home experience same home operating expense growth with  versus the same period last year primarily driven by our utility conversion program and merger related bad debt expense in q of last year core yearoveryear expense growth which normalizes for these drivers increased  in late  we initiated a new utility program where we will keep water sewer trash in our name  of the time this change explains the rent growth for our utility line item which is substantially offset by resident charge backs we constantly look for opportunities to operate more effectively and this program aids in turn efficiency and the resident move in experience in fact this program has already helped reduce our rehab turn times by  versus q of last year to an average of  days bad debt expense increased yearoveryear due to an unusually low amount of q of  coming out of the merger consistent with other quarters bad debt expense is still within our expected range of  to  combining revenue growth and expense growth we grew core net operating income by  versus the same period a year ago our core net operating margin for the quarter was  primarily driven by three factors strong occupancy and rent growth our ability to maintain property management costs at  of revenue and a  increase in combined property tax insurance and hoa cost we delivered core margins greater than  and nearly every market in almost half of our  markets delivered core noi margins greater than  we are particularly excited about margin performance in markets like denver las vegas phoenix nashville and charlotte raleigh which are all current acquisition markets where we acquire combined  homes or  of the  homes acquired during the quarter turning to cost of maintaining our homes same home rm turnover expense averaged  per home and same home recurring capex averaged  per home totaling  per home for the first quarter approximately  lower than a year ago we believe that our expected cost to maintain range of  to  is an appropriate run rate overtime for our portfolio i would like to highlight a few of our operating initiatives that take aim at further driving down these costs both in the shortterm and the longterm first we are seeing improvement of inhouse technician utilization and efficiency through route optimization technology improvements and work order bundling this initiative has led to an increase in daily work order completions for technician yearoveryear reductions in average cost for hvac and roofing work orders where we are leveraging national procurement to drive down material and labor costs lastly we have realized the reduction in work order volume yearoveryear by taking advantage of trip voiding opportunities these are just some of the reasons we are seeing yearoveryear reductions in cost to maintain our homes and expect that trend to continue through the balance of  on our last call we described some expectations for  and we are pleased with the results produced in the first quarter of this year we are well positioned to capitalize on the  peak leasing season with a high quality portfolio industry leading revenue management platform and unique technology capabilities that blend seamlessly with our talented team members i will now turn the call over to arik arik prawer thank you charles today i will provide color on our financial results provide an update on capital market activities and capital allocation then well conclude with  guidance through the three months march   the company recorded revenue of  million on a gaap basis we recorded a loss of  million or  per share which includes depreciation and amortization core ffo for the quarter was  million or  per share our solid financial results were driven by continued strong operating metrics for the samestore cohort that both fred and charles highlighted we were quite active in the capital markets in  thus far we’ve taken a number of steps to extend on maturities fix our cost of capital diversify our funding sources and raise growth capital for the business highlights include we completed a well executed  million convertible transaction effectively refinancing substantially all of our convertible notes through  moreover we lowered the coupon by  basis points and increased the merchant price by  per share we also entered into a  million swap transaction that effectively fixed the rate of our interest on the last securitization at  increasing our fixed rate debt ratio to over  today as you know we had our debut primary equity offering whereby we raised over  million of growth capital and enabled our sponsors to sell  million of secondary shares this successful offering strengthens our balance sheets provides growth capital and enhances our flows we also implemented  million atm program during the quarter we view this as another capital tool to potentially match fund growth over time its spread referenced we recently closed on a  million corporate credit facility to replace our prior two secured credit facilities representing another milestone capital development this is a traditional style reit revolver with lower cost of funding greater flexibility and lower administrative burden and cost in our private facilities the interest rate is based upon a leverage grid and we expect pricing to be approximately libor plus  basis points for future borrowings moreover it has far away provisions should we achieve an investment grade rating during the term of the loan lastly subsequent to the quarterend we paid down  million on a securitization loan this pay acts as a cash management tool to reduce cash balance following the equity raise so we had a good capital market year this quarter and as a result we had no near term debt no near term debt maturities our debttomarket capitalization of  fixed rate profile of over  and over  million of liquidity turning to capital allocation our cost of capital both in the equity and debt markets has improved meaningfully and allows us to be active consolidators in this space further increasing our ability to buy accretively as fred mentioned we have robust pipeline that brings our acquisitions target range to  million to  million for the year excluding any significant portfolio transactions we anticipate a monthly run rate of approximately  million for single asset acquisitions we will continue to grow the buildtorent pipelines opportunistically review small and midsized portfolios and remain positioned to act on large portfolio transactions we entered last year with  million capital recycling program i am pleased to announce that we are over twothirds through that program with the remaining  million of asset earmarked for future disposition we expect to  million to  million of dispositions in  as we continue our ongoing portfolio optimization program lastly i will revisit guidance for the year for the full year  we continue to forecast core ffo per share in the range of  to  per share this represents double digit growth over the prior year we now enjoy almost  homes in our same home set ph providing considerable stability and predictability specifically our operational assumption for  includes same home occupancy averaging between  and  for the year turnover of  to  same home revenue growth of  to  same home expense growth of  to  and same home core noi margins of  to  our operating platform continues to optimize and deliver industry leading metrics our industry enjoys a constructive macro backdrop and would like our footprint in terrific markets with strong household formations and job growth dynamics we had a highly productive first quarter from an operating financial and balance sheet perspective we like our growth prospects for the year and beyond and look forward to continuing to deliver on all cylinders for our shareholders with that let’s turn the call back to the operator for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of david corak with fbr capital markets please proceed with your question david corak good morning in terms of the new build deal flow could you give us an update on your thoughts and discussions with developer there you mentioned on the last call the  homes were in some sort of formal contract including the small portfolios but maybe just an updated in the number and timing there then have you guys put into place any kind of larger contract this year or just still mainly the smaller deals with a handful of developers frederick tuomi okay yeah this is fred thank you for your question yeah we’re still very excited about the newbuild concept weve been doing it for several years going back to even premerger with both companies and we already have roughly  of these in our portfolio today but we’ve amped up the activity actually we haven’t had to go too much on outreach they’re coming to us now or as before we had to go cultivate these relationships so we’re now with the newbuilds we’ve gone about  in the first pipeline we’re already delivered on  this year and we think that the balance this year we could probably continue about  more and then we already had commitments for about  of those deliver spilling into  and that pipeline continues to grow as the relationships that we have become deeper and we cultivate more new relationships with small local builders regional builders and a few of the large nationals we currently have about  relationships of various types with different builders in our target markets one more interesting part on both buildtorent as we’re also developing some  fully contained buildtorent communities where every home is a rental and we have about  of those in process now three of them actively delivering and eight of them in the queue yet to come david corak okay great and then turning back to acquisitions the  million or so you bought this quarter what do you think is an appropriate yield or cap rate for that is this a good run rate for the rest of the year going forward then for the newbuild the yield on those what kind of premium are you guys underwriting those to arik prawer yeah the cap rates have been very stable for all of  and coming into  we havent seen any movement on cap rate across our markets for the type of high quality homes that we’re interested in that we’re buying well located good neighborhoods good schools low crime et cetera so our buybacks have been very steady very consistent very disciplined and we’ve been able to fill that our allocation  million to  million a month one option small portfolios and newbuild the cap rates on the single asset acquisitions have been very steady with the  to  range in q we averaged this a little over  and that’s spread across the markets of north carolina where we bought  assets nashville where we bought  phoenix about  denver  and then others spread between dallas and las vegas and atlanta capex might be a couple ticks lower in hot markets such as phoenix in california if we’re buying this that we have not is a little bit higher in the north carolina and nashville markets so in terms of the newbuild cap rates the interesting type there we’re building brand new homes at a higher cap rates where we’ll get yield of  to  plus on the newbuilds today david corak okay great and then one last one for me i appreciate the new samestore disclosure very much makes modeling a lot more efficient but just digging in a little bit can you talk a little bit more about the rise in the bad debt it’s kind of in the middle of your range or has been in the higher end of kind of range you’ve stated so just trying to figure out that’s material or is it just the merger comp one of your peers had a pretty big increase as well so just want to make sure it not really a systemic kind of trend and if you have it maybe it would help us to see what april is versus last year and as a percentage of rent frederick tuomi yeah we dont see this as being any systemic thing its really when you look quarteroverquarter we had a really low bad debt number and coming in at  is actually the lowest weve been over the last three quarters so the trend is actually down which is positive so this is something that we look at it’s within our range we hope to overtime to drive it down but right now as we look at  we think the range from  to  we feel comfortable and we should be in that range by the end of the year looks like in april we’re about flat to where we were in q yes the large percentage increase on quarteroverquarter was purely driven by the low bad debt experience that we had our first quarter of the of the merger where we had on cutting back on home side that come into the merger with a very conservative over accrued bad debt allowance so we had that benefit so if you look at this way the trends that we provided in our supplemental you can see an unusually q was clearly a comp issue quarteroverquarter david corak okay all right fair enough thanks a lot guys operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of douglas harter with credit suisse please proceed with your question douglas harter thanks i was hoping you could – in the half of the markets that youre ready above a  noi margin do you think there is more room for that to go higher arik prawer yeah we look at our portfolio across all of our markets and we really like our footprint and obviously we’ve had a handful of markets like denver phoenix las vegas charlotte northern california that are comfortably above  this quarter and have been there pretty consistently as i talk about on previous calls our opportunity was in our more stabilized more growing markets as of  in the merger where the way with buying homes in texas in florida were going to stabilize those in  and what youre seeing now is the margins tick up there and we’re getting good momentum so we see that as our opportunity to grow those markets that’s miami orlando tampa as well as looking at houston which is starting to get good occupancy now so there’s an opportunity to grow those markets and then is this overall efficiencies that we’ve gained through the merger and we continue to look to optimize use our technology and get more efficient so we want to put all the margins up but the opportunity is in florida and texas for us right now douglas harter great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jade rahmani with kbw please proceed with your question jade rahmani thanks very much you guys have been at the forefront of pioneering technologies technology investments in the space in singlefamily rental are there any new technology investments that you’re looking into that could potentially improve efficiencies or add to other revenues frederick tuomi yeah jade this is fred thank you yeah we do believe weve been on the forefront and fortunately going back to the very beginning of this venture our sponsors allowed us in fact encourage us to invest heavily in the technology for the long run right from the get go so we have a little bit of unfair advantage there we’re early adopters and early creators of a lot of these technologies that are now given us a lot of benefits not only for ourselves but for customers as well but youre never done we’re constantly refining and enhancing what we already have and constantly challenging our people up and down the organization to come up with the next big thing so we’ve got some ideas in the hopper you’ll have to wait and see what those are but charles and his team and larry our cto and the whole group we continue to have the creative juices flowing i can tell you that one area that we’re going to continue to leverage is our smart home we started just a couple of years ago it started off really as a necessity just for key control migrated into an expense savings on utility management and basic utility control and then it went into enhancing and making the leasing process more efficient for our leasing people and for our customers that was largely adopted and braced by our customers as well as our field employees and now turn into an ancillary revenue source we pick that same system and put it into the hands of our residents who just had an enjoyable experience using it in a leasing process is a easy sell have them continue it into the living process so we think they can take that platform and continue to add to it in terms of efficiencies internet of things is a real thing being able to analyze and detract and do preventive and predictive maintenance activities getting constant feedback on centers in our homes as well as figure out new ways to enhance that ancillary revenue source through the addition of other types of home automation home control security et cetera so that’s a big frontier for us but we’ve got several other tricks up our sleeves that aren’t quite yet to talk about charles young a lot of this as fred said is built off of smart home we’ve contained a lot of efficiencies but we need to roll this out in terms of the ancillary revenue and we have the systems in many of the homes already that people are in and we can go start those and so there’s ongoing predictive analytics that will help us on cost to maintain so there’s a lot of things that we’re going to trying to build off in the smart home apparatus jade rahmani in terms of the platform what percentage of work orders are currently done with internal employees frederick tuomi yeah we’re running  and  depending on the region some regions were able to do a little more that number runs a little higher in slower rm season of q and q but monthovermonth has been growing and we feel comfortable that that’s part of what’s driving our cost to maintain down our number down quarteroverquarter charles young yeah and we’re continuing to refine that process but we would never expect that to be  so that would mean that you’re overstaffed for similar parts during the year because of the seasonality of the business so we believe in tapering that to an appropriate labor utilization rate if we get our labor utilization in the sweet spot maybe  or so then we know we’re doing well but the key point with our technology platform on the service delivery side is that our tech platform is agnostic in terms of who’s delivering that service to the resident at that time by that i mean our vendors that are embedded and improved on to our platform as well as our employees working on the platform in a type of manner both carry smartphone with the same app operate upto to same supply and procurement database are distributed through the same route optimization and call routing system and supported by the entity identical call center so whether it’s a vendor or an employee our platform really doesn’t care it doesn’t differentiate we just want to get the right person at the right spot with the right tools and the right skills at the right cost at the right time that’s a big technology challenge but we think we’re low on the way of deploying that and its working quite well so far to fred’s point we spend a lot of thinking about the tech efficiency and yearoveryear we’ve been able to drive it up by about  and we’ve seen some of our top performers who are doing three or four work orders a day last year performing well over five five to six so driving those – again is the route optimization and it’s about being intelligent around our dispatch thinking about the service region the technician and who more qualified person to go out there and bundling those work orders as well so we’re currently looking in china optimize that jade rahmani can you comment on capex spend which continues to run a bit high at i think over  per home annualized what are the main items is a small part of the portfolio driving a large amount of the capex spend do you expect improvement going forward frederick tuomi yeah as we think about  to  cost to maintain range as we’ve analyzed the portfolio over last year we think is a  split between expense and capex so coming in this month that the  is kind of right on a number as you know with capex its lumpy that will be difficult to predict so we pay attention to it and as we’ve mentioned before  of our portfolio is performing well below those numbers so we are trying identify those outliers and pay attention to them think about whether we can resolve the issues or potentially dispose them and overall though the main drivers of capex hvac about kind of  or the big part of is we think it’s a big part of it and our procurement cost have been able to bring those costs down so we’ve been able to reduce hvac by  or  and roofing cost for  or  using our national platform and national labor and material rates so we’re constantly looking at it we keep in mind though this is a seasonal metric as we go into q and q these numbers may go up a little and come down again in q so we’re watching it closely and looking to drive a number down quarteroverquarter jade rahmani and lastly just wanted to why turnover increased despite improvement in renewal and retention rates was the function of denominators the number of lease expirations and a larger portfolio or was it something else explain that charles young yeah now good question we had more explorations in q this year than last year our actually retention in renewal rates as you mentioned were at the top of numbers for us to date so we feel good about that and i think that’s reflecting in our strong margins but we had as we look at our lease exploration schedule we wanted to move up those explorations earlier into q at peak leasing season already picking up where you can see from our replacement rents we were able to take advantage of turning out home quickly and having the high demand now the other of it is as you know we came out of the merger we had multi year leases and a lot of those multi year leases were expiring in q and so that’s part of why you see a little higher turnover the reality is it still a good number at  we have a range of  to  for the year where lease expiration schedule is going we feel comfortable with where that number stands today frederick tuomi one example of our revenue management platform as charles just mentioned coming into this early on we didn’t have a great time through data base of historical we had a lot of our instincts and our knowledge from multi family business which served us quite well in setting the ideal lease exploration curves for each market and each sub markets so what we’ve noticed in the singlefamily business over the last couple of years is that february march are pretty strong leasing months it’s surprised me the first time the second time it was a trend another data point and then third time there was a trend so the only thing to do is take really a little bit of pressure off of the absolute peak of the peak leasing season and exploration forward in our system our revenue management system coupled with our atlas system in the hands of the field management employees allow us from our asset management group to change the shape of the curve at the desire and then it takes maybe the balance of that year to implement to build that in so now we have a little bit of more of a shift in curve a little bit more into q a little bit less at the peak of the q q arik prawer and you could really see it from our strong demand in replacement rents over q really low twos january february and  in march really ramped up and is driving entire april at over  so it’s actually great timing in terms of our expirations coming through able to turn them quickly and capitalize on the demand operator our next question comes from the line of vincent chao of deutsche bank please proceed with your question vincent chao just a quick question on the market a little disclosures i’m just curious i know they’re still very strong in terms of rate growth in orlando and tampa but we have heard from the department guys that there is some supply pressures that are starting to cost some deceleration of growth and you guys did also have a little bit of decel on that front as well just curious if you’re seeing anything change in the market conditions in those two markets charles young this is charles q it was seasonal slow down which is expected we were able to keep our occupancy strong so we gave up a little bit on replacement rent there were some pressures from competitors who were doing some concessions but we stay strong but ultimately to your question as we look at april in orlando our rent growth have moved up from  in q to  so it’s moving up nicely in tampa where we were  which is a little lower than we wanted in tampa but we’re  in april so that’s moving up and miami also went from below three to over  so again we tried to balance the rent growth with occupancy we went into q in a really strong position with occupancy and taking advantage of that strong demand that picked up in april you’re able to see our rent growth start to accelerate frederick tuomi yeah in terms of supply as i mentioned in my comments before and have mentioned this previously some of the time you allow one of our advantages is that we don’t really have susceptibility to supply charts you’re not going to have a couple thousand buildtorent homes brought into the market or several thousand converts from ownership to rent in a local club market it’s just not going to happen whereas an apartment business we know that that can happen from time to time when everyone decides to build same time and same place so any kind of rent growth or occupancy or any kind of variability i don’t see it ever happening as a result of supply shock it may be other competitive factors but it certainly won’t be supply jade rahmani well i guess at some point if the apartment guys cut enough then there might be but i guess just curious you mentioned that the competition was giving some concessions you were referring to other singlefamily rental competitors not apartment guys is that correct charles young not apartment singlefamily rental and mostly was those who were acquiring new markets who were trying to get leased up we’re not seeing that anymore now that the demand is there they’ve moved off those frederick tuomi orlando and tampa you might see a little more home buying move outs for home buying they’re always at the top of the chart there and based on seasonality and the home purchasing plus you may have a little more pressure in orlando singlefamily homes or so affordable charles young those are two of the top three for home purchases jade rahmani got it okay i guess just sticking with the markets to their disclosures changed a little bit in terms of how you’re breaking out the markets so kind of got rid of the top  markets i think some of the other markets were broken out a little bit more granularly here so that’s all good i was just curious if there’s anything to read into that in terms of where you’re looking to scale if maybe some of the other markets are now more interesting to you in terms of trying and grow than previously charles young no change that’s really just to clean up that page in the supplemental and to be consistent the way we think about it internally we still love our market footprint it’s a fairly small footprint but it’s a very deep footprint and it’s in the high growth markets in terms of the national economy in terms of growth as we’ve mentioned several times over the last year or so we continue to grow in our sub scale core markets which are nashville raleigh and charlotte denver phoenix so we’re putting most of our acquisition efforts on those markets and then be opportunistic in any of our core markets as deals come to us that maybe attractive that we can tuck in and further increase our density and further add to our overall operating performance there but no other read into how we to show the information on those stages jade rahmani got it okay and then just one last clarifying question for me just the guidance for samestore revenue and expense growth was unchanged it does look like that those ranges both exclude the change utility across that you mentioned earlier that thats a place and at the end of  but i guess as we’re comparing your performance yeartodate i think on page  is the only adjustment we have to make here to the  that was reported on a revenue size is taking out  for that’s disclosed in the footnote is that the right way to think about it frederick tuomi well you said when you’re looking at the rental revenue just look at that line rental revenue and then the other income other utility so you have that core growth of  being more accurate for this quarter kind of neutralizing the impact of that utility conversion program just like on the expense is the same way so q has a small number of transactions relative to q and q q and q is really where you make you drive the year results so i wouldn’t read off you can’t just take q and multiply it by four so we can update that more as we come into the end of second quarter on the next call arik did you have anything arik prawer yeah i would just say mathematically you just deducted from revenue the resident utility reimbursement and then deducted from expenses and that will be give you the net revenue and expense growth and then another way to think about is just look at the quarter which kind of which takes out the target facts and that’s approval all of this is consistent with our guidance jade rahmani right okay thanks operator operator instructions final question will come from the line of john pawlowski with green street advisors please proceed with your question john pawlowski thanks charles i believe heading into the year you were expecting occupancy to be flat but you picked up  bps yearoveryear so curious was it a change of strategy as you went through the quarter in terms of what youre seeing on the ground or was it just an upside surprise leasing activity charles young with our revenue management asset management platform we’re always trying to optimizing between occupancy and rent growth and we know that the busy leasing season is coming which is going to do add to a little bit of a turnover and so we really wanted to go in strong and we’ve been able to do that so nice surprise but we still had some good rent growth in q right at what we expected maybe a little higher and i think it puts us in a really great position in q to optimize rents as much as possible so i think it was a strategy of trying to find the right balance and we have our legs under us in each region is trying to find out right balance working closely with asset management so went in good shape and i think it will show in q john pawlowski okay and then on the expense side curious if you can give some color what’s shifting within the property management cost bucket last year at different samestore pool but last year costs were down  this year they’re up  through q so what can we expect over the balance of the year in property management cost charles young yeah this is charles good question as we’ve mentioned actually put in my opening remarks there we expect pm expense as a percentage of revenue to run  to  we ran low all last year and we became in in q right in the middle of that range of  so we feel comfortable where that number one was and some of that was as looked at q we’re  and q we’re at  we feel we ran low but we executed well and since june of  we acquired  homes in charlotte raleigh  homes in nashville another  homes in phoenix dallas and denver so as we looked at q we saw that we had the growth capital hand from the equity raise and the current acquisition and anticipated acquisition growth it was time to moderately have that in our under scale regions of nashville charlotte and raleigh so while we had to anticipate what’s coming and when you have a under scale region sometimes you need a higher slightly out ahead when you go into the larger regions like denver and dallas you don’t need to hire as many bodies we’re there we have our scale it’s a lot easier and the other thing i’ll add is our centralized call center we knew we were understaffed in q the demand wasnt huge so in q anticipation of peak leasing season we added a few of our new teammates to the squad and it served well we’ve been able to keep up with the demand and ultimately we think pm ph expense at  is going to be that run rate between  to  for the year and we’re pleased with our operational results in the quarter both noi occupancy and leasing john pawlowski last one for me fred or arik when you’re setting up the capital plan and the balance sheet for  and  i guess what specific factors came into play to ramp your acquisition pace modestly frederick tuomi its fair enough as i mentioned in my opening remarks really our cost of capital both on the debt and equity side give us an opportunity to deploy capital very accretively so when the recent with our pipeline with the equity raise that was really sized to our pipeline we thought that it made sense to have a sort of a  million to  million year it’s very consistent with our previous statements where substantially this is going to be funding with the equity from the offering and then we also have a capital recycling program to the tune of  million to  million thats there so it’s a combination of the opportunities that are out there and our ability to finance them accretively so we’re fortunate in that way john pawlowski great thanks for your time operator we have reached the end of the questionandanswer session mr tuomi i would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments frederick tuomi good thank you all very much we had great first quarter looking forward to the balance of the year and we’ll see many of in the new york in june thank
