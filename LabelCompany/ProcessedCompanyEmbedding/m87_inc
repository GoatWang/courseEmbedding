goovaerts at wireless weekly november thwhat if your smartphone didn’t need to move closer to the tower to get a better connection because it could tap into the stronger signal of a phone nearby what if it didn’t need a cellular or wifi connection at all to talk to the devices around itturns out both of those hypotheticals will soon be reality at least if m has anything to say about itthe wireless technology company led by former tmobile executive cole brodman is currently trialing a new solution that would allow devices at the edge of the network to connect and form their own “proximate networks”here’s how it worksaccording to broadman the technology – developed by vidur bhargava and dr sriram vishwanath at the university of texas at austin – uses software to bridge and route between different radio technologies to allow devices like smartphones to connect with other devices nearby – whether or not they’re connected to the internet via wifi or cellular this in turn allows devices to share information like location or text messages with one another and even help each other find the easiest path to the best network connectionbrodman said the technology is “more or less” radio agnostic multioperating system ios and android multirf and multihop to allow single or multiple hops between devices trying to reach the networkread the full article at wireless week comment comment

m software wow comment comment the wifi alliance  on m and wifi innovations september   from a keynote address by kevin fitchardlast month gigaom ran a big feature series called ‘reinventing the internet’ exploring how broadband technology applications policy and security were evolving – and should evolve – to connect the world in the st centuryi handled the wireless component of that series and i slightly surprised myself by writing as much about unlicensed technologies like wifi as i wrote about traditional cellular networkshere were my conclusions the mobile internet of the future isn’t going to be supplied by a single carrier using a single wireless technology on a single service plan if we truly want to use mobile broadband the way we use fixed broadband then our wireless signals will come from multiple sources and one of those key sources will be wifimy colleague stacey higginbotham took that idea one step further when she wrote this headline last august “who’s your new mobile carrier how about wifi”her argument was that wifi has become so key to connecting our mobile devices that selecting the wifi networks available to you is far more important than what mobile carrier you choose as an example republic wireless a mobile virtual network operator with a wifi first focus was seeing  percent of its mobile traffic traverse wifi networksof course republic is a small mvno with a customer base committed to this kind of data offload model if you talk to a more a traditional carrier they’ll tell you this kind of model will never work for most people mobile networks use dedicated spectrum mobile networks are planned and managedrelying on wifi as your primary mobile internet connection would be inviting chaos and they’re right wifi is chaotic as anyone who has ever been to big industry conference where every exhibitor sets up their own network knows this the competition for the unlicensed bands’ limited capacity is fierce everyone has experienced connecting to a dead or overloaded hotspot and having to force your phone off the network but anyone who has ever tried to connect to a g network during rush hour in downtown chicago has experienced similar problemsyes wifi can be chaos but i would argue that it’s a beautiful chaos many of the most popular mobile applications we have today got their start and maintained their popularity because of wifi if you ever streamed an hd movie to your tablet on netflix then you probably did it over wifiwifi hasn’t just been a source of tremendous capacity but also an incredible driver on innovation unlike cellular spectrum which is licensed and tightly controlled by the operators the openness of the unlicensed bands allows anyone with a new idea to go for brokeat gigaom we write a lot about startups and increasingly the networking startups i talk to are making wifi the centerpiece of their businesses open garden is using wifi direct and bluetooth to build ad hoc messaging networks that bypass the internet entirely m is trying to help carriers build faster and more resilient cellular networks by letting phones crowdsource their connections via wifi see more at

which uses lte radios to connect two nearby devices directly rather than use the mobile network as intermediary if qualcomm were to combine its own lte direct efforts with m’s crowdsourced

range our competitors only give you illinois we give you concealed carry training for both illinois  florida which is accepted in  states we give you twice the bang for your buck than our competitors telephone        evening weekday  weekend classes available     home     one thing that is of utmost importance is that you do not use the below ammunition to kill  you use the below ammunition to stop a life threatening attack against you when you have no other alternative  if the attacker dies then the responsibility for the attackers death rests only with the attacker  using finely manufactured self defense ammunition is of critical importance when using your concealed carry handgun in a combat situation if you use cheap practice ammunition in combat it could easily cost you your life  when you go to a pistol range and practice with your conceal carry handgun you can use much less expensive ammunition that is called practice ammunition this ammunition can be either factory ammunition or reloaded ammunition the average distance in a gun fight is from  feet to  feet because these distances seldom are beyond  feet the ballistics of cheap practice ammunition is so close to expensive finely manufactured combat ammunition that the difference or where the bullet strikes the target can be measured in one inch or less at  feet distance to the target in a gun fight that would come down to cheap ammunition striking the left ventricle of the targets heart and expensive finely manufactured combat ammunition striking an inch away in the right ventricle of the targets heart it really will not make much difference so use cheap factory ammunition when you are firing live rounds at a paper target on a live fire pistol range but not in a gun fight how to test the finely manufactured combat ammunition you have choosen to know exactly how the finely manufactured combat ammunition you have chosen works with and feeds in your semiautomatic concealed carry pistol do the following fire three combat rounds in quick sussession at a paper target at the live fire pistol range if any of the three finely manufactured combat ammunition rounds has any problems feeding into your semiautomatic concealed carry pistol then get rid of that specific combat ammunition and never ever use that combat ammunition in that specific semiauto concealed carry pistol again you do not need to have your concealed carry pistol have any malfunctoion whatsoever during a gun battle chose another finely manufactured combat ammunition that will pass the above test  so what is the difference between cheap practice ammunition and finely manufactured combat ammunition the difference is in the quality of the cartridge case the quality of the primer the quality of the powder in the cartridge and the care and preciseness used to manufacture each cartridge but the most important part in combat ammunition is the type and combat quality of the bullet lastly finely manufactured combat ammunition is much much less likely to fail to function properly in the middle of a gun battle  a wise suggestion on choosing which exact finely manufactured combat ammunition to use in you concealed carry pistol after you have survived and won the gun battle with the bad guy how would you like to either spend years in prison or have all your property taken from you in a civil law suit  whatever finely manufactured combat ammunition you use in your concealed carry pistol the jury will be told that your ammunition was exploding dum dum killer bullets by the attorney that is trying to nail you to the cross to solve this problem just call your local police department and ask a command officer in charge what manufacturer brand caliber bullet weight and bullet type that that specific police department mandates that their police officers use when on duty thereby you can answer that attorney trying to crucify you with the answer that you used the exact same finely manufactured combat ammunition that your local police department or sheriffs office has chosen to use for their own police officers to use when they are on duty in your concealed carry pistol thereby you are using the exact same ammunition that has been humanely chosen for pruposes of not just killing a person outright but defending yourself from lethal attacks by a criminal the jury will understand that the ammunition you used shows that you are not a mad dog killer but that you choise the most humane ammunition possible and they should accept this lets start off by showing you what a bad combat bullet looks like why are the above bullets bad because they all are solid bullets which means that if they are fired at a target there is a high degree of probability that the bullet would go completely through the target and then after exiting the target may still have enough energy  force that the bad bullet could then strike and seriously injure or kill an innocent person  bad bullets have been known to simply wound the bad guy because the bad bullet does not open up in the bad guy thus causing little damage to the bad guy many real life combat situations have been that after the bad bullet leaves the bad guy the bad bullet goes right through a wall and wounds or kills an innocent person that innocent person could be a loved one so using bad combat bullets in a gun fight is a pretty sure way of causing great bodily harm to some innocent person in the vicinity of the gun fight do not use this bad bullet type of ammunition when you are carrying your concealed pistol for self defense purposes  the perfect combat bullet never leaves the target so thereby the perfect combat bullet would then only cause injury to the target we all know that nothing in this world is perfect so the combat bullets i will be talking to you about are all imperfect combat bullets bullet placement on the target is everything in combat if you shoot a target in the hand with the best combat ammunition in the world that bullet has a  chance of exiting the target with enough energy to seriously injure or kill an innocent person so using the best combat ammunition does not totally eliminate the chance of injuring an innocent person if you put that good combat bullet in the wrong place on the bad guy  there are some exceptions to using bad bullets in combat is there ever a situation where a specific bad combat bullet would be good to use in a combat situation the answer is yes if you had a gun fight where the bad guy took cover behind a wooden wall then a solid bullet would be able to completely penetrate the wooden wall and still retain enough energy to kill or cause great bodily harm to the bad guy so what does that mean to you it means that you could carry one magazine with good combat bullets that is loaded into your concealed carry handgun and then have a second magazine with you that contains solid bullets that can easily penetrate walls do most gun fights take place where one or more combatants are behind wooden walls or behind cover of some sort the answer is  normally that is not what happens in most gun fights yet it is a possibility that you can not ignore do not be cheap when it comes to buying combat ammunition for when you are actually carrying your concealed carry handgun why because if that ammunition fails to perform as expected it could cost you your life  what does a good combat bullet look like the answer is that good combat bullets come in two ways the st way is that they are made of a substance that allows the good bullet to come apart in the target these bullets are called combat frangible bullets most of these bullets have a hollow point the nd way is that these good combat bullets have what appears to be solid points such as the glazer safety slug shown below we will first talk about the glazer safety slug glazer safety slugs were first manufactured by corbon in  for the use by us air marshals in airplanes in flight in that a glazer safety slug would not penetrate the skin of an airplane and thus not cause explosive decompression in the passenger cabin which could easily lead to catastrophic failure in flight of the airplanes exterior skin structure what you might notice when you look at the above picture of a glazer safety slug is that inside the bullet case are bbs when the glazer safety slug enters a human target the blue plastic ball in the front of the bullet comes out of the bullet the exterior skin of the bullet easily peals back and releases all the bbs inside the target thus causing a massive wound cavity massive pain to the target and a very low probability of any of the glazer safety slug material exiting the target and hurting an innocent person all the above happens if the glazer safety slug is placed in the center mass or chest area of the target you will notice that the color of the plastic ball at the point of the above shown glazer safety slug is coloredblue glazer safety slugs are manufactured in two manners for use under two separate conditions glazer safety slug condition  during the late spring summer and early fall when people wear light clothing the glazer safety slug with the blue colored ball will be able to penetrate that light clothing and expand correctly within the target and perform as described above glazer safety slug condition  during the late fall winter and early spring when people wear heavy clothing the glazer safety slug with the blue colored ball could when entering that heavy clothing easily explode on the surface of that heavy clothing and thus cause little if any damage to the target but if you used a glazer safety slug with the silver colored ball then that bullet will first penetrate the targets outer heavy clothing and then upon entering the targets skin expand correctly within the target and perform as described above so if you are going to use a glazer safety slug as your combat pistol ammunition you have to change that ammunition from the blue color to the silver color when it gets cold and people start wearing heavy clothing if you can not find glazer safety slugs in your area stores then you could purchase it directly from corbon click here for the corbon web site corbon dpx combat bullet gel pack test video we will now talk about target range frangible bullets  frangible bullets initially came about to solve the problem that takes place at a target range when a lead bullet is fired from a handgun at a pistol range a small amount of the lead of that bullet is turned into powdered lead and also when the lead bullet strikes the backstop of the pistol range another larger amount of lead is turned into a powder this powdered lead can be breathed in by the shooters in the target range as well as could be breathed in by people in their homes and back yards of the immediate area that surrounds the target range lead is a substance that can and does cause a large amount of negative medical conditions in peoples health so owners of target ranges to eliminate the possibility of causing problems to the health of their customers as well as the health of their neighbors came up with a bullet that is not made of lead and literally explodes on contact with the target ranges backstop these bullets are called for our discussion target range frangible bullets many frangible bullets are manufactured for target range purposes only and are not manufactured for combat purposes an easy way to tell the difference is that combat frangible bullets are usually but not always hollow point bullets the series of high speed pictures shown below shows a target range frangible bullet when it strikes a solid wall the st picture shows the bullet as it strikes the wall the nd picture shows the bullet as it starts to come apart and sprays the wall with particles of the bullet the rd and th pictures show the target range frangible bullet as it completely comes apart and sprays the wall with nearly all the material of the bullet most important is the picture does not show any part of the target range frangible bullet turning into a dust thus nearly eliminating the need for expensive air filters to remove health damaging lead dust from the air now let us talk about combat frangible bullets a combat frangible bullet is made to come apart inside the target an example would be the below two gel block pictures if you look at the first picture you will see many small pieces of the bullet shoot off from the main part of the bullet upon entry into the gel block each of these small pieces stays inside the gel block and the remaining larger portion of the bullet shown on the right of the picture does not exit the gel block but stays completely inside the gel block thus  of this combat frangible bullet would normally stay inside the target this first combat frangible bullet is penetrating further into the gel block than the second example shown below the second gel block test of a combat frangible bullet that appears above shows the bullet coming apart within the target much quicker than the st gel block test picture shown above but both of the combat frangible bullets shown above stay completely within the gel block and would be more reliable not to exit the target and injure an innocent person in the area of a gun fight combat frangible bullets can look like the below pictures but one fairly common shared thing about these combat frangible bullets is that they are hollow point bullets what a combat frangible bullet normally looks like after penetrating a target is shown below what is important about the above pictures is that these bullets have almost doubled in diameter which means the target will sustain more tissue damage more pain and more bleeding due to the razor sharp edges of these bullets which will significantly reduce the targets ability or the targets determination to continue the gunfight the doubling of the diameter of the bullet also allows the bullet to transfer more of its energy to the target thus reducing significantly the chance of the bullet having enough energy to exit the target and injure or kill an innocent person in the area of the gun fight manufacturers of combat frangible bullets are shown below  m inc does not recommend one manufacturer over another for we think all these bullet manufacturers work very hard to deliver to you an extremely reliable product  barnes corbon federal premium ammunition hornady nosler remington sturm ruger  company sig sauer elite performance ammunition speer winchester there is some talk within the conceal carry community about leo ammunition which is law enforcement only ammunition there was a time  to  years ago that you as a civilian could not purchase leo ammunition but that is not the case today one of many examples today is speers gold dot ammunition that when sold in a box labeled leo ammunition contains  rounds per box but the exact same speer gold dot ammunition is sold to civilians and is not marked leo ammunition and is sold  rounds per box never purchase any ammunition if it is tracer or incendiary ammunition because it could make your pistol explode in your hand when you fire it below is a whole new bullet technology arx bullet polycase has developed an effective yet softshooting arx bullet   arx inceptor video slow motion video of arx bullet seen tumbling in gelatin target the grain bullet in polycases inceptor load makes for a softshoot round that still performs like a  special is supposed to notes all bullets weigh  grains accuracy results are averages of five fiveshot groups at  yards on a champion rest velocities are averages of  shots recorded with a labradar set to record  feet from the muzzle polycases newest offering is a  special featuring the companys arx bullet which has an inter­esting grain weight the listed velocity is  fps which is at first glance pretty enthusiastic but keep that weight in mind the arx bullet does not expand the three flutes in the bullet profile are the aspects of the bullet that do the work of creating a wound channel the mathematics of fluid dynamics are beyond our scope but testing indicates that they work the rotating bullet drives into the target and flutes attempt to push aside the tissue it travels through the shape of the flutes works to accelerate the tissue as it is pushed and this creates the wound channel and decelerates the bullet and we can tell the arx is working by its lack of penetration—the opposite of how we usually judge a bullet  the arx bullet does not penetrate as deeply in any loading as a similar full metal jacket or lead roundnose does typical penetration of a  special grain lead roundnose is on the order of  inches and i tested the polycase  special load in four different doubleaction revolvers that are suitable home defense or carry guns a twoinch smith  wes­son model  one of my favorites a threeinch smith  wesson model  a fourinch smith  wesson model  which i shoot in idpa and a sixinch smith  wesson model  those last two were classic police duty guns for many decades  i figured with four different barrel lengths id get a good read on the polycases performance the  spe­cial arx penetrated just a bit under or over  inches in ballistic gelatin regardless of the velocity or barrel length for those who worship at the altar of the fbi tests this indicates marginal or failed performance but no other  special load is going to pass and despite its detractors the  special is not ineffective  another interesting aspect was an additional quick test i did with the sixinch model  i placed a inch marine plywood barrier in front of a gel block and recovered a bullet that had traveled not quite an inch less than out of the same gun into a block without a barrier  in talking with the polycase engi­neers at an industry function they were not at all surprised the arx acts like a jacketed roundnose on a barrier but the flutes still work in tissue behind the barrier a company rep told me and unlike a hollowpoint the flutes of the arx cant get plugged with barrier material the lighter arx combined with its high velocities would lead you to expect a radical change in point of impact superspeed lightweight bul­lets can print to a different location on the target than traditional bullet weights arx accuracy was as good as any other ammo ive tested out of those guns and the point of impact let weights and the arxs light bullet also translates to less recoil making it more attractive to new shooters or the recoil sensitive a grain bullet at  fps has a power factor of only  which is mild in anybodys book the impression of recoil i got with the model  was in between a  acp and a  auto—and yet it deliv­ers into gelatin like a  special the powdered metal in the poly­mer construction of the bullet means it enthusiastically fragments on a steel plate breaking up to the point of almost turning into powder you can shoot steel plates closer with arx still you need to wear glasses than you can with any other bullet the customary safety distance with regular bullets is  yards as long as the steel is smooth—not dented or cratered—you could safely get closer than  yards with arx so a new shooter receives soft recoil hits con­sistently because of the close range and gets the immediate feedback of banging a steel plate or knocking over the falling plates thats the way to build confidence and allow the new shooter to have fun and they could be doing this with a compact light revolver eminently suitable for home defense or concealed carry one other note the arx ammo feeds easily into a revolvers cylinders the flutes dont catch on the chamber edges the rounds drop right in all this sounds like a good prescription for someone in need of a defensive tool—a person who might not otherwise consider arming themselves because they think a gun has to be big and loud polycase gives them an effective option without a lot of noise and polycase is aggressively expanding the line and it wont be long before it has something for pretty much any handgun you own including semiauto calibers but right now a whole lot of  special owners find themselves with an attractive new op­tion priced similar to most defensive ammo features revolutionary defense technology from the research and development laboratory of polycase ammunition® the inceptor® arx® is the nextgeneration of defense ammunition through advanced design and materials science the arx® uses fluid dynamics and nonexpanding surface area instead of expansion to achieve terminal performance engineered fluid dynamics by design the enhanced surface area and design of the arx® exploit the bullets forward energy and redirect that energy in the form of hydraulic displacement hydrostatic shock this hydraulic displacement creates a wound cavity that rivals that created by expanding bullets lateral force the arx® bullets hydraulic displacement effect is achieved by the arx® technology the arx® flutes — grooves on the nose of the bullet — have wide mouths and narrow exit points hen combined with the bullets forward velocity into soft tissue the design of the arx® flutes causes an increase in pressure of the fluid as a result the fluid is laterally ejected from the flutes at a higher velocity than the actual speed of the bullet itself creating the massive cavitation and wound channels seen in the arx® gelatin tests specially engineered profile because it has no hollowpoint or sharp edges on the nose of the bullet the arx® feeds like a round nose yet retains stopping power and terminal performance that exceeds many expanding handgun bullets precise injection molded arx® projectiles deliver exceptional accuracy high velocity achieves higher velocity and higher energy than many other defense cartridges yet imparts less recoil for quicker follow up shots advanced materials performs in a wide range of conditions and weapons
