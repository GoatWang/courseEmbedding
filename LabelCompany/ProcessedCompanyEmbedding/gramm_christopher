‘enron loophole’ by eric liptonnov   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story in  senator phil gramm played a central role in writing the commodity futures modernization act a law that would open the door to unregulated trading of credit default swaps the financial instruments blamed in part for the current economic meltdownbut there was another aspect of this legislation that earlier this decade helped produce another financial meltdown the collapse of enron the texas energy companythe commodity futures act in addition to allowing unregulated trading of financial derivatives included language advocated by enron that largely exempted the company from regulation of its energy trading on electronic commodity markets like its oncepopular enron online the provision came to be known as the enron loopholeemail written by enron executives and lobbyists — which became public as part of a federal investigation after enron collapsed — shows how top enron officials closely monitored negotiations on the bill they paid particular attention to mr gramm who before a final agreement in late  was trying to press other key figures on capitol hill and at the white house to agree to concessions that would further curtail regulation of trading advertisement continue reading the main story enron’s primary concern was that mr gramm’s insistence at getting these additional freemarket concessions — most of which were unrelated to enron’s business — might scuttle the whole deal killing enron’s chance of getting the loophole it sought continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story enron was a major contributor to mr gramm’s political campaigns and mr gramm’s wife wendy served on the enron board which she joined after stepping down as chairwoman of the commodity futures trading commissionalthough not directly related to the current economic crisis the enron email provides a window into how much clout mr gramm had as chairman of the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs and the ways lobbyists intervened to advance and defend their interests during negotiations on the billthe commodity futures modernization act was approved in december  just before bill clinton’s term as president ended mr gramm in a recent interview said he was not responsible for inserting the language into the bill that established the enron loophole but once the commodity futures modernization measure — with this provision included — reached the senate floor mr gramm led the debate urging his fellow senators to pass it into lawfollowing are excerpts from some of the email pulled from the enron files that discuss mr gramm and this legislation all of the email is available at enron explorer a site that has put the enron email into a searchable format more information on the enron loophole is available hereaug   ‘we need senator gramm’ christopher m long an enron lobbyist writes to other enron executives updating the status of the negotiations over the commodity futures modernization act and urging enron’s chief executive kenneth lay to call senator gramm to nudge him on the topic as

negotiations led by secretary summers were initiated last week between the cftc and sec and that progress was being made on the single stock futures issue the major issue postponing movement of the legislation advertisement continue reading the main story the senate agriculture committee passed out the senate version in july however the bill is not moving quickly in the senate due to senator phil gramm’s desire to see significant changes made to the legislation not directly related to our energy language last week at the republican convention i asked the senator about the bill and he said they were working on it but much needs to be changed for his support more telling perhaps were wendy gramm’s comments that she would rather the current bill die if a better bill can be passed next year what this means is that we must at the least remove senator gramm’s opposition to the bill to move the process and more importantly seek to gain his support of the legislationhowever with less than  or so legislative days left we need senator gramm to engage a call from ken lay in the next two weeks to senator gramm could be an impetus for gramm to move his staff to resolve the differences gramm needs to fully understand how helpful the bill is to enron let me know your thoughts on this approach i am prepared to assist in coordinating the call and drafting the talking points for a ken laysen gramm calloct   talking pointsmr long again writes enron executives providing “talking points” that mr lay should bring up in his conversation with senator gramm senator gramm in a recent

we have contacted senator gramm and majority leader armey about the calls from ken on monday because of the uncertainty of the congressional schedule both offices told us to call on monday morning to schedule the call if ken wants to make the calls unscheduled we expect armey and gramm to both be in dc by monday morning confidential talking points on commodity futures modernization act of  backgroundwe have hit an impasse on the cftc reauthorization legislation on legal certainty nearly all interested parties agree however senator gramm continues to raise objections unrelated to legal certainty for our business there are two issues which we understand have primarily been advanced by senator gramm one on bank products and one on sec jurisdiction majority leader dick armey is trying to gain consensus with the interested parties which include senator gramm the chairmen of the house agriculture commerce and banking committees as well as the department of treasury cftc and sec meetings are occurring on a daily basis but little concrete progress has been made since draft legislation was released on october talking pointswe need your help to resolve outstanding differences so that the commodities futures modernization act of  can pass this year there are very few legislative days left and movement now on this legislation is essential do not let the congressional calendar be the enemy of gaining legal certainty for this dynamic and growing industrythe current version of the legislation provides important legal certainty for all physical commodity transactions not including agricultural commodities entered into on a counterpartytocounterparty basis or on an electronic trading facility we strongly support these provisions advertisement continue reading the main story the legislation eliminates concerns that our derivatives transactions may be illegal or that our online platforms may be unregulated futures exchanges these provisions allow our businesses to grow and innovate without this legislation the industry will be crippled with legal uncertainty and these platforms will develop overseasvirtually all of the issues in this very complex legislative package have been resolved we are indifferent to outstanding provisions except to the extent that they impede passage of the legislation we cannot allow the great progress made to date fail in the endif asked about a possible solution to the logjam answer encourage majority leader armey senator gramm and secretary summers to meet immediately to finalize the remaining issues given time constraints if such a meeting does not occur in the next few days there may not be enough time to pass this important legislationnote congress will be going out on either october  or october oct

the senate banking committee gramm’s proposed changes to the cea bill this proposal is quite lengthy and includes many amendments most of which were previously discussed with the house agriculture committee some of which were included in house agriculture committee saturday night draft of  because of the length of the document we have only attached the summary that the gramm staff provided in separate emails to follow we will send only the pages of the housepassed bill that were changed by the gramm proposal as you know some of these provisions include matters objectionable to treasury sec cftc chicago and new york exchanges as you also know the view of the agencies and the ag comm is that some of these exclusions create loopholes which can allow some market participants to avoid the new single stock futures regulatory design the cftc oversight of the energy market and go far beyond the recommendations of the president’s working groupthe staffs of the banking and agriculture committees have agreed to meet tomorrow late morning we believe at that time the agriculture committee will propose a counteroffer which while addressing the gramm major concerns will not adopt his proposal but instead rely on the treasury proposals if senator gramm is willing to work off this alternative a negotiation may result otherwise it is unlikely that any agreement with gramm will be reached the agriculture committee is disinclined to repeat the debates held in the house agriculture comm consideration of the bill we welcome your reaction to the proposaloct   an optimistic notemr

jeffrey keeler  moresent  at congress passes the commodity futures modernization act of late friday afternoon december  congress passed the commodity futures modernization act of  the purpose of the act is to eliminate unnecessary regulation of commodity futures exchanges and other entities falling within the coverage of the commodities exchange act “cea” and the provide legal certainty with regard to certain futures and derivatives transactions by enacting such changes congress intends to promote product innovation and to enhance the competitive position of us financial markets certain provisions of the act open the door for enron’s further product innovation and growth specifically the act provides important legal certainty for energy and other transactions occuring both on an overthecounter otc bilateral basis and on multilateral electronic trading platforms enron was a leading advocate of passage of this legislationbilateral transactionsunder the act bilateral transactions in all commodities other than agriculture commodities that do not occur on trading facility ie not on a multiparty exchange are exempt from most provisions of the cea as long as the transactions are entered solely between “eligible contract participants”ie persons and certain legal entities satisfying capital thresholds and other requirements under the act this provision essentially codifies and expands existing cftc exemptions for swaps and forward contracts thereby eliminating a degree of legal ambiguity that has frustrated product innovation and growthmultilateral transactionsin addition the act creates a broad exemption for any agreement contract or transaction in commodities other than agriculture commodities so long as they the transactions are between “eligible commercial participants” are entered into on a “principletoprinciple basis” and that take place on a multiparty “electronic facility” this exemption could facilitate expansion of enrononline to allow for multiparty transactions however certain legal requirements will have to be metother transactionsthe act also creates a broad exclusion for a number of commodities that are of interest to enron including “credit risk measure” commodities and weather derivatives  again the derivative transaction exclusion will have to meet certain legal thresholdsthis legislation has been over six years in the making and the collective support of many enron employees has been crucial thank you to all that have contributed to the passage on this important legislation we will have a more through legal

try to influence the selection of the new cftc chaircommissionersas noted below jim newsome has been selected as acting chair i mentioned this to ken raisler and stacy carey everyone agrees that newsome is a known quantity though he may not be a superstar in the mold of bill ranier ken said newsome knows our issues and is favorable to a “free market” approach to energy and metals however there is some concern about his ability to reign in the cftc staff newsome is the favorite currently for the position with boosters in senators lott and cochran and his college roommate rep jerry moran rks however it is still early in the game and unknown chair candidates could still be out there including officials passed over for more high profile positionsif newsome is nominated as the chair an additional commissioner a republican position opens and will be named by speaker denny hastert hastert is from the suburbs and the assumption is that he the chicago exchanges may influence the appointment stacy carey is poking around to determine what chicago exchanges are thinking one name that has been mentioned often is retired congressman tom ewing who has expressed interest in a commission seat but not the chair ewing is supportive of our issuesdavid spears is also likely to leave but no date has been announced this is also a republican seat the democrats barbara holum and tom erickson are likely to stick around until their terms expirewe can try to float names of persons we would like to see either chair or join the commission also we have learned that wendy gramm has

think he’s very nice and appears to be very free market spears the other republican appointee is not at all free market in my view i would not like this to mentioned anywhere else but i have found that the farm reps on the commission may sound deregulatory but are not and have been really troublesome without a good free market person on board and there are no truly free market persons on board at the commission every single other agricultural rep that i worked with on the commission were trouble even though they claimed to be deregulatory — and they were far worse before i got there and after i lefti visited with newsome a day before inauguration and i was appalled at what they were planning to do concerning agency structure — that would have elevated the regulatory lawyers and diminished the role of the economists at the agency misguided and showed to me a lack of understanding of how organizational structures can affect what comes out of an agencyi am often at odds with the industry view regarding cftc issues i don’t think the futures exchanges who have a lot of power necessarily are procompetition and many of the nonexchange folks who lobby on cftc issues are washington or new york democrat  which is why they want to involve ken at this level lawyers who do not understand markets and who are more interested in being able to claim influence or impact the cftc is in awful shape — the quality of staff is horrendous and the commission is relying on some of the worst people for their policy work same folks that brooksley born used same folks who have advocated more regulation of the otc market for years many quality folks do not want the job as chairman because it’s been such a backwater i am looking for some good folks have at least one person who would be good at that job and it’s not newsome please do not share this information with the usual folks as they hate me anyway i’m too free market and have argued against their fixes sorry for

outside the beltway it is not well known that a victorias secret catalog was responsible for a key aspect of the grammleachbliley act read the story here jan  introduction information that many would consider privateincluding bank balances and account numbersis regularly bought and sold by banks credit card companies and other financial institutions the grammleachbliley act glba which is also known as the financial services modernization act of  provides limited privacy protections against the sale of your private financial information additionally the glba codifies protections against pretexting the practice of obtaining personal information through false pretenses the glba primarily sought to modernize financial servicesthat is end regulations that prevented the merger of banks stock brokerage companies and insurance companies the removal of these regulations however raised significant risks that these new financial institutions would have access to an incredible amount of personal information with no restrictions upon its use prior to glba the insurance company that maintained your health records was distinct from the bank that mortgaged your house and the stockbroker that traded your stocks once these companies merge however they would have the ability to consolidate analyze and sell the personal details of their customers lives because of these risks the glba included three simple requirements to protect the personal data of individuals first banks brokerage companies and insurance companies must securely store personal financial information second they must advise you of their policies on sharing of personal financial information third they must give consumers the option to optout of some sharing of personal financial information grammleachbliley act glba title v of the glba sections with financial privacy and pretexting protections history of the glba the history of the glba has its roots in the separation of banks brokerage companies and insurance companies as a result of the financial failures of the great depression congress in  passed the glasssteagall act prohibiting national and state banks from affiliating with securities companies in  congress passed the bank holding company act that prohibited a bank from controlling a nonbank company in  congress amended the bank holding act to further forbid banks from conducting general insurance underwriting or agency activities this changed however in  when the glba repealed sections of these acts and allowed banks to engage in a wide range of financial services the privacy risks from such mergers were put onto the agenda by a series of international and domestic events on the international front in  the eu passed the data protection directive which required that international data exchanges that used eu citizens personal data be accorded the same level of protection that their home country would afford them this meant that us companies would have to ensure that when they used eu citizens personal data they provided the same level of protection these citizens were afforded within the eu the eu was especially concerned with the us governments preference for selfregulatory approaches to privacy and the lack of federal privacy legislation while the euus agreed to a safe harbor proposal which allowed for companies to selfregulate under ftc oversight financial services industries were not included in the original agreement in the united states privacy was increasingly cited as being at risk public polls at the time indicated citizen privacy awareness and unhappiness with the banking industrys lack of concern for consumer privacy issues these poll responses led to subsequent studies that indicated how much consumers were concerned with ineffectual bank privacy standards and the lack of consumer protections against unwanted information sharing these attitudes were further fueled by a series of high profile cases involving banks selling consumer information with adverse consequences for customers including marketing credit fraud and identity theft in november  charter pacific bank of agoura hills california sold millions of credit card numbers to an adult website company which then proceeded to bill customers for access to internet porn sites and other services they did not request some of the customers billed did not even own a computer the website company had set up numerous merchant accounts under different names to avoid detection in september  the ftc announced that it has won a  million judgment against the website company while the bank maintained that it did not do anything wrong it has since then stopped selling credit card numbers to merchants in  nationsbank later merged with bank of america was fined millions for securities law violations because it shared customer information with its affiliate subsidiary nations securities the subsidiary then convinced low risk customers to buy highrisk investments many nationsbank customers lost large amounts and many senior citizens lost large amounts of their life savings in june  the minnesota attorney general initiated a lawsuit against us bankcorp for sharing customer information with third party marketers in violation of its own policies without customer knowledge or authorization the telemarketers then illicitly charged those customers us bankcorp eventually settled that case along with those brought by  other state attorneys general in april  minnesota settled with the third party telemarketer memberworks that us bankcorp used according to memberworks sec filings  out of the  largest banks in the us had contracts with it other prominent banks including chase manhattan and citibank have been involved in schemes where personal account information is sold to telemarketers this confluence of international and domestic events prompted congress to include title v in its glba provisions which contains limited privacy protections for financial information the glba was introduced in the senate by senator phil gramm rtx as  s  and in the house of representatives by representative james leach ria as  hr  it was signed by president clinton and became public law   stat  on november   the privacy protections are codified at  usc §   s  senate version  hr  house version  usc §  conference report h rept  citibank settlement with new york attorney general privacy protections under the glba the glbas privacy protections only regulate financial institutionsbusinesses that are engaged in banking insuring stocks and bonds financial advice and investing first these financial institutions whether they wish to disclose your personal information or not must develop precautions to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer second financial institutions are required to provide you with a notice of their information sharing policies when you first become a customer and annually thereafter that notice must inform the consumer of the financial institutions policies on disclosing nonpublic personal information npi to affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties disclosing npi after the customer relationship is terminated and protecting npi nonpublic personal information means all information on applications to obtain financial services credit card or loan applications account histories bank or credit card and the fact that an individual is or was a customer this interpretation of npi makes names addresses telephone numbers social security numbers and other data subject to the glbas data sharing restrictions third the glba gives consumers the right to optout from a limited amount of npi sharing specifically a consumer can direct the financial institution to not share information with unaffiliated companies consumers have no right under the glba to stop sharing of npi among affiliates an affiliate is any company that controls is controlled by or is under common control with another company the individual consumer has absolutely no control over this kind of corporate family trading of personal information there are several exemptions under the glba that can permit information sharing over the consumers objection for instance if a financial institution wishes to engage the services of a separate company they can transfer personal information to that company by arguing that the information is necessary to the services that the company will perform a financial institution can transfer information to a marketing or sales company to sell new products different stocks or jointly offered products cosponsored credit cards once this unaffiliated third party has your personal information they can share it with their own corporate family however they themselves cannot likewise transfer the information to further companies through this exemption in addition financial institutions can disclose your information to credit reporting agencies financial regulatory agencies as part of the sale of a business to comply with any other laws or regulations or as necessary for a transaction requested by the consumer fourth financial institutions are prohibited from disclosing other than to a consumer reporting agency access codes or account numbers to any nonaffiliated third party for use in telemarketing direct mail marketing or other marketing through electronic mail thus even if a consumer fails to optout of a financial institutions transfers your credit card numbers pins or other access codes cannot be sold as they had been in some previous cases fifth certain types of pretexting were prohibited by the glba pretexting is the practice of collecting personal information under false pretenses pretexters pose as authority figures law enforcement agents social workers potential employers etc and manufacture seductive stories that the victim is about to receive a sweepstakes award or insurance payment in order to elicit personal information about the victim the glba prohibits the use of false fictitious or fraudulent statements or documents to get customer information from a financial institution or directly from a customer of a financial institution the use of forged counterfeit lost or stolen documents to get customer information from a financial institution or directly from a customer of a financial institution and asking another person to get someone elses customer information using false fictitious or fraudulent documents or forged counterfeit lost or stolen documents however investigators still can call friends relatives or entities not covered by the glba under false pretenses in order to gain information on the victim problems with the glba first the glba does not protect consumers it unfairly places the burden on the individual to protect privacy with an optout standard by placing the burden on the customer to protect their data glba weakens customer power to control their financial information the agreements optout provisions do not require institutions to provide a standard of protection for their customers regardless of whether they optout of the agreement this provision is based on the assumption that financial companies will share information unless expressly told not to by their customers and if customers neglect to respond it gives institutions that freedom to disclose customer nonpublic personal information second the glba notices are confusing and limit the transparency of information practices glba assumes a company will explain a complex set of legal definitions added to numerous exceptions to the law in a way that will allow for an informed choice and in transparent language there are reservations about a companys desire to do this moreover according to recent studies most privacy and optout policies are usually convoluted confusing and misleading since they are created by entities whose interests are better served when there is no effective notice glba does little to deal with the lack of transparency in the privacy notices themselves typical privacy notices do not include any specific information about how the data is actually used glba notices do inform consumers that their personal information will be shared but they generally do not inform the individual of who will receive the information or the purposes for which it will be used third the glba fails to enhance consumers control over affiliate information sharing consumers have no optout right against affiliate information sharing in todays world of megamergers a bank may have over one thousand affiliates some of which may be completely unrelated to financial services fourth financial institutions can evade optout requirements by exploiting the exceptions in the glba the service providerjoint marketing exemption allows financial institutions to share information with nonaffiliated third parties despite a consumers optout fifth the glba has weak enforcement and compensation mechanisms glbas enforcement mechanisms are inadequate to assure compliance with even existing weak privacy protections enforcement rests solely with federal government agencies leaving the individual no private right of action how the glba could be improved privacy advocates and industry groups have asked for some substantial changes to the glba to ensure greater protection and consumer security some of these changes include financial institutions should implement an optin approach to the use of personal information because this minimizes any unwanted or unknowing disclosure of information and places the burden of responsibility on those actors who will gain from the disclosure of information if an optout framework is maintained financial institutions should be obligated to give and accept alternative optout methods they should be required to provide simple optout processes including easy access to privacy policies at branch offices and online through a single web site with optout information in order to ensure greater transparency and accountability financial institutions should include in their privacy reports what information is going to be used for financial institutions should be required to provide customers with a statutory right of access to learn more about industry practices in order to know how the information is collected who its affiliates are and what the information collected for is used financial institutions should provide simply stated and clear privacy policies financial institutions should be required to follow acceptable standards for readability by displaying clearer and more transparent privacy reports expand enforcement authority to give states concurrent jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of glba in order to ensure a more efficient enforcement program individuals should have the right to protect their privacy and seek remedies and redress under glba as glba currently stands there is no private right of action give individuals the right to review information that is disclosed or to correct inaccurate or incomplete data state law and the glba as with most consumer protection legislation the glba allows states to formulate protections that exceed federal law the state law debate over glba privacy protections has primarily revolved around the question of whether to adopt an optin standard for information sharing and whether to create protections for affiliate information sharing more states consider moving ahead with tough financialprivacy laws wall street journal march   financial privacy status of state actions on gramm leach bliley acts privacy provisions gao report  april  in california governor gray davis focus upon privacy during his campaign has made california a place to watch a broadbased coalition that includes the consumers union the american association of retired persons the american civil liberties union and other groups will launch an attempt to place the consumer financial privacy issue on the november  ballot the initiative interestingly is to be funded by an internet executive chris larsen the ceo of eloan felt strongly enough that consumer privacy fears were a major impediment to his business that he donated  million to fund the initiative in north dakota shortly after the passage of the glba north dakota passed emergency legislation to eliminate optin protections in the state members of the states constitution party strongly objected to this and collected the  signatures necessary to get the issue placed on the ballot for statewide review a group called protect our privacy formed and with the help of the american civil liberties union aclu they raised about  to campaign for optin support an opposition group driven mainly by bankers and financial interests raised well over  to oppose optin much of that money was spent on misleading ads including one that claimed atms would no longer work in the state if optin was adopted this caused such controversy that the state attorney general issued an opinion specifically rebutting this claim the referendum provided the first opportunity for voters to express their opinion on optin and consistent with the strong support for optin demonstrated in public opinion polls the voters overwhelmingly rejected optout  supported reestablishing the optin standard north dakotas action is likely to spark voter initiatives for optin in other states advocates in north dakota also plan to expand optin next year by applying the standard to the insurance industry north dakotans to vote on bank privacy rules new york times june    formal opinion f north dakota attorney general may   june  north dakota primary results in vermont the states department of banking insurance securities and health care administration adopted optin provisions for information sharing to comply with the regulation some companies have simply treated all vermont residents as having optedout under glba however a group of insurance companies has mounted a challenge to the requirements in other states alaska alaska stat §  connecticut conn gen stat ann § a illinois  ill comp stat ann  and maryland md code ann §  require some form of optin consent before financial information can be shared

challenge computerworld february   july  petition to federal agencies on glba on july   epic along with public citizen and other organizations submitted a petition to the glba entities with their concerns regarding financial notices in this petition they requested an amendment to the regulations implementing glba to ensure the consumers are provided with better notice and more convenient means of exercising their right to opt out of information sharing epic argued that the notices mailed out thus far by financial institutions employed dense misleading statements and confusing and cumbersome procedures to prevent consumers from opting out their arguments were that the glba could not protect privacy unless the agencies required readable notices and reasonable optout opportunities they believe that the existing scheme placed much of the burden of privacy protection on consumers and that recent privacy notices show that the regulations under glba are failing to protect consumer privacy by providing obfuscated information and optout schemes couched in legalistic and confusing terms with misleading options and providing limited alternative options such as  hour toll free numbers financial institutions sought to deprive consumers of the their right to prevent these institutions from sharing private information moreover most privacy notices lack adequate definitions of important terms and phrases and requires thus the effort of the agencies to amend existing glba regulations to ensure that consumers have meaningful opportunities to exercise their rights these regulations should require financial institutions provide standardized notice that consumers can understand and optout mechanism that consumers can use conveniently the petition also includes specific recommendations regarding notices and optout mechanisms including examples of clear statements and formats the option to send an email or use a web page and a detachable preaddressed postcard with boxes in which to check off preferences with these changes the petitioners believe that consumers can exercise their right more effectively with notices that are readable and understandable and with optout mechanisms that are easy to use public citizen petition on glba privacy rights now what you can do to protect your privacy be sure to optout of information sharing from all of your financial
