uspq  edmich or they may themselves designate a type of product and therefore not subject to registration see j gilson supra §  at  n  see generally id §  prior to the lanham act geographically descriptive marks were treated the same as generic marks and while a manufacturer of a product could maintain unfair competition or fraud claims he could not benefit from the protection of a trademark regardless of secondary meaning see elgin national watch co v illinois watch case co  us    s ct    l ed   section  of the lanham  act however recognizes the principle that geographically descriptive terms which attain secondary meaning are entitled to legal protection and federal registration j gilson supra §  at  section e denies registration where the mark when applied to the goods of the applicant is primarily geographically descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of them unless the registration of a mark used by the applicant  has become distinctive of the applicants goods in commerce  usc § e f there may be some products where the geographic label has lost its meaning entirely and represents a type of product and is thus generic as one commentator points out it is questionable whether the consuming public perceives swiss cheese as cheese from switzerland or merely a generic type of cheese the same may be said for chablis applied to white wine and burgundy applied to red see j gilson supra §  at  n  see also scotch whisky assn v barton distilling co  fd  th cir holding label of scotch misdescriptive when applied to whiskey made in panama without discussion of whether scotch whisky is a generic type of liquor health industries v european health spas  f supp   dsd  adding to the list above french fried potatoes and danish pastry but the vast majority of geographic designations fall into the primarily geographically descriptive category this is particularly true where the geographic area is a well known source for the product in question if the particular class of product is widely noted as originating in one region country or area a geographic term applied to such a product is likely to be regarded as primarily geographically descriptive thus swiss for watches paris for perfumes french for wines and hawaiian for pineapples would undoubtedly be regarded as geographically descriptive terms j gilson supra §  at  see also saratoga vichy spring co inc v lehman  f supp   ndny to that list we can safely add florida for citrus fruit and products the state of florida has a strong association with citrus fruit which both the state and the citrus fruit growers protect and promote there is no doubt that florida when applied to citrus punch at least in part suggests the  geographic origin of the product that does not however foreclose doric from establishing secondary meaning it simply makes its job more difficult see saratoga vichy spring co inc v lehman  fsupp at  the issue of whether a mark has become distinctive as representing a particular companys goods is a question of fact union carbide corp v everready inc  fd   th cir cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   the burden of establishing that the mark has become distinctive is a heavy one where the type of product is generally associated with the geographic area the party claiming the trademark must demonstrate that the mark denotes a single thing coming from a single source aloe creme lab inc v milsan inc  fd   th cir cert denied  us   s ct   l ed d   quoting cocacola co v koke co  us   s ct   l ed   in the instant case doric in resisting bodens motion for summary judgment need not convince us that florida citrus punch has attained a secondary meaning in commerce it need only raise a genuine factual dispute on the issue fedrcivp d a party seeking to establish secondary meaning may rely on direct evidence of consumer recognition or indirect evidence consisting of sales volume advertising expenses and other indicia of recognition and promotion of the product in commerce union carbide corp v everready inc  fd at  in addition where the holder of the mark has a finding of distinctiveness under section f from the patent office he is entitled to a presumption that the mark has attained secondary meaning j gilson supra §  at   n  but see homemakers home and health care service inc v chicago home for the friendless  fd  th cir  no presumption applies where registration was permitted on merely descriptive term without a finding under § f in the case at bar doric meets its burden of raising an issue of fact on secondary meaning merely by relying on the finding made by the patent and trademark office it is clear from the history of dorics attempt to register florida citrus punch that the hearing examiner believed the term to be geographically descriptive and only permitted registration upon proof of secondary meaning the ultimate approval issued in march  was specifically based on a finding of distinctiveness under § f moreover the affidavits submitted by doric state that  containers of florida citrus punch were sold roughly between  and  and substantial money was expended promoting the product while these facts are not dispositive and can be refuted by evidence of consumer nonrecognition boden has submitted no such evidence much like the plaintiff in saratoga vichy spring co who was seeking protection for its mark boden has relied almost exclusively upon conclusory allegations that the consuming public must believe florida citrus punch is without secondary meaning because of the association between the state of florida and citrus while there may be some appeal to plaintiffs common sense approach conclusory allegations are no substitute for evidence on a motion for summary judgment accordingly plaintiffs motion for summary judgment is denied notes  both parties submitted a number of exhibits for consideration exhibit g of plaintiffs memorandum contained an incomplete copy of the patent and trademark office file concerning dorics attempts to register the mark at issue upon consideration we determined that it would not be possible to adequately rule on this motion without more complete information and therefore requested the parties to submit the remainder of the file referred to in plaintiffs ex g we cite to the file as submitted pursuant to this request by the court as plaintiffs supplemental ex g followed the title of the particular document referred to  the disclaimer appears on the face of dorics trademark as listed in the principal register see complaint ex l  see complaint ex m  the dictionary definition of punch is inter alia a beverage composed of fruit juices and other nonalcoholic liquids as tea ginger ale and usually served cold websters third international dictionary at    boden attempts without benefit of evidence to fit the mark in this case into the category of french fried potatoes brussels sprouts english horns and worcestershire sauce see plaintiffs reply brief at  the argument fails for several reasons in the first place boden has failed to identify a single product other than the two involved in this litigation which describes itself as florida citrus punch or even citrus punch from florida there is much evidence of other products which contain the geographic designation florida including orange juice and grapefruit juice see reply memorandum ex  but that is irrelevant in deciding whether dorics mark is generic in the second place even if the issue here is whether florida citrus is generic which is not the issue it is apparent that the term falls into a different category than the examples cited above the items which boden cites are generic if at all because they have lost their geographic meaning and have come to stand for a type of product regardless of where it comes from ie no one really thinks french fried potatoes come from france or that english horns are made in england the very evidence submitted by boden establishes that people do think florida citrus comes from florida and in fact the state of florida and florida growers go to great lengths to assure consumers that their expectations are met see n  infra boden apparently confuses the distinction between generic terms and those that are geographically descriptive and thus while not protectable on their face can become trademarks upon proof of secondary meaning in short there is no justification either in the evidence presented or otherwise for concluding that florida citrus punch is a generic phrase  in the saratoga case the plaintiff was attempting to claim a monopoly on the use of the word saratoga as applied to any mineral water product regardless of the remainder of the title the equivalent here would be if doric was attempting to prohibit boden from using the word florida as a designation on its citrus drink regardless of the remainder of the identification doric has not taken that position  see plaintiffs reply memorandum at exs   and   see plaintiffs supplemental ex g  boden claims in its reply brief that the evidence of advertising and sales volume applies to products labeled sunny delight  florida citrus punch and therefore is not applicable on the issue of secondary meaning for the mark florida citrus punch the evidence of how doric promotes its products and indeed what they are called is not at all clear at least some of the advertising presented as evidence promotes florida citrus punch without any other product title see complaint exs fj in any case the ultimate question of whether consumers understand the mark to designate a product originating from a single source is a question of fact we agree with boden that where the mark is accompanied by another registered trademark phrase evidence of sales and advertising revenues is far less persuasive than if the mark was the single product name nevertheless because there are genuine issues of fact in dispute summary judgment is inappropriate  another common sense approach might be for boden to call its product a florida citrus drink or a citrus punch from florida see j gilson supra §  at  footnotes omitted even though one business has established secondary meaning rights in a geographically descriptive term other businesses may still inform the public that their goods are made in the same locale section b sets forth the fair use defense and permits a defendant in an infringement action to make nontrademark use of a term which is descriptive of and used fairly and in good faith only to describe to users the goods or services of such party or their geographic origin thus he may advertise that his mens slacks are made in nashville tennessee if they are but he may not sell them as nashville brand slacks where such a use could violate the prior rights of another and result in the likelihood of confusion see  usc § b this assumes and we realize the fact is in dispute that

principle that geographically descriptive terms which attain secondary meaning are entitled to legal protection and federal registration j gilson supra §  at  section e denies registration where the mark when applied to the goods of the applicant is primarily geographically descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of them unless the registration of a mark used by the applicant  has become distinctive of the applicants goods in commerce  usc § e f there may be some products where the geographic label has lost its meaning entirely and represents a type of product and is thus generic as one commentator points out it is questionable whether the consuming public perceives swiss cheese as cheese from switzerland or merely a generic type of cheese the same may be said for chablis applied to white wine and burgundy applied to red see j gilson supra §  at  n  see also scotch whisky assn v barton distilling co  fd  th cir holding label of scotch misdescriptive when applied to whiskey made in panama without discussion of whether scotch whisky is a generic type of liquor health industries v european health spas  fsupp   dsd  adding to the list above french fried potatoes and danish pastry but the vast majority of geographic designations fall into the primarily geographically descriptive category this is particularly true where the geographic area is a well known source for the product in question if the particular class of product is widely noted as originating in one region country or area a geographic term applied to such a product is likely to be regarded as primarily geographically descriptive thus swiss for watches paris for perfumes french for wines and hawaiian for pineapples would undoubtedly be regarded as geographically descriptive terms j gilson supra §  at  see also saratoga vichy spring co inc v lehman  fsupp   ndny to that list we can safely add florida for citrus fruit and products the state of florida has a strong association with citrus fruit which both the state and the citrus fruit growers protect and promote there is no doubt that florida when applied to citrus punch at least in part suggests the geographic origin of the product that does not however foreclose doric from establishing secondary meaning it simply makes its job more difficult see saratoga vichy spring co inc v lehman  fsupp at  the issue of whether a mark has become distinctive as representing a particular companys goods is a question of fact union carbide corp v everready inc  fd   th cir cert denied  us   sct   ledd   the burden of establishing that the mark has become distinctive is a heavy one where the type of product is generally associated with the geographic area the party claiming the trademark must demonstrate that the mark denotes a single thing coming from a single source aloe creme lab inc v milsan inc  fd   th cir cert denied  us   sct   ledd   quoting cocacola co v koke co  us   sct   led   in the instant case doric in resisting bodens motion for summary judgment need not convince us that florida citrus punch has attained a secondary meaning in commerce it need only raise a genuine factual dispute on the issue fedrcivp d a party seeking to establish secondary meaning may rely on direct evidence of consumer recognition or indirect evidence consisting of sales volume advertising expenses and other indicia of recognition and promotion of the product in commerce union carbide corp v everready inc  fd at  in addition where the holder of the mark has a finding of distinctiveness under section f from the patent office he is entitled to a presumption that the mark has attained secondary meaning j gilson supra §  at   n  but see homemakers home and health care service inc v chicago home for the friendless  fd  th cir  no presumption applies where registration was permitted on merely descriptive term without a finding under § f in the case at bar doric meets its burden of raising an issue of fact on secondary meaning merely by relying on the finding made by the patent and trademark office it is clear from the history of dorics attempt to register florida citrus punch that the hearing examiner believed the term to be geographically descriptive and only permitted registration upon proof of secondary meaning the ultimate approval issued in march  was specifically based on a finding of distinctiveness under § f moreover the affidavits submitted by doric state that  containers of florida citrus punch were sold roughly between  and  and substantial money was expended promoting the product while these facts are not dispositive and can be refuted by evidence of consumer nonrecognition boden has submitted no such evidence much like the plaintiff in saratoga vichy spring co who was seeking protection for its mark boden has relied almost exclusively upon conclusory allegations that the consuming public must believe florida citrus punch is without secondary meaning because of the association between the state of florida and citrus while there may be some appeal to plaintiffs common sense approach conclusory allegations are no substitute for evidence on a motion for summary judgment accordingly plaintiffs motion for summary judgment is denied footnotes  both parties submitted a number of exhibits for consideration exhibit g of plaintiffs memorandum contained an incomplete copy of the patent and trademark office file concerning dorics attempts to register the mark at issue upon consideration we determined that it would not be possible to adequately rule on this motion without more complete information and therefore requested the parties to submit the remainder of the file referred to in plaintiffs ex g we cite to the file as submitted pursuant to this request by the court as plaintiffs supplemental ex g followed the title of the particular document referred to  the disclaimer appears on the face of dorics trademark as listed in the principal register see complaint ex l  see complaint ex m  the dictionary definition of punch is inter alia a beverage composed of fruit juices and other nonalcoholic liquids as tea ginger ale and usually served cold websters third international dictionary at    boden attempts without benefit of evidence to fit the mark in this case into the category of french fried potatoes brussels sprouts english horns and worcestershire sauce see plaintiffs reply brief at  the argument fails for several reasons in the first place boden has failed to identify a single product other than the two involved in this litigation which describes itself as florida citrus punch or even citrus punch from florida there is much evidence of other products which contain the geographic designation florida including orange juice and grapefruit juice see reply memorandum ex  but that is irrelevant in deciding whether dorics mark is generic in the second place even if the issue here is whether florida citrus is generic which is not the issue it is apparent that the term falls into a different category than the examples cited above the items which boden cites are generic if at all because they have lost their geographic meaning and have come to stand for a type of product regardless of where it comes from ie no one really thinks french fried potatoes come from france or that english horns are made in england the very evidence submitted by boden establishes that people do think florida citrus comes from florida and in fact the state of florida and florida growers go to great lengths to assure consumers that their expectations are met see n  infra boden apparently confuses the distinction between generic terms and those that are geographically descriptive and thus while not protectable on their face can become trademarks upon proof of secondary meaning in short there is no justification either in the evidence presented or otherwise for concluding that florida citrus punch is a generic phrase  in the saratoga case the plaintiff was attempting to claim a monopoly on the use of the word saratoga as applied to any mineral water product regardless of the remainder of the title the equivalent here would be if doric was attempting to prohibit boden from using the word florida as a designation on its citrus drink regardless of the remainder of the identification doric has not taken that position  see plaintiffs reply memorandum at exs   and   see plaintiffs supplemental ex g  boden claims in its reply brief that the evidence of advertising and sales volume applies to products labeled sunny delight — florida citrus punch and therefore is not applicable on the issue of secondary meaning for the mark florida citrus punch the evidence of how doric promotes its products and indeed what they are called is not at all clear at least some of the advertising presented as evidence promotes florida citrus punch without any other product title see complaint exs fj in any case the ultimate question of whether consumers understand the mark to designate a product originating from a single source is a question of fact we agree with boden that where the mark is accompanied by another registered trademark phrase evidence of sales and advertising revenues is far less persuasive than if the mark was the single product name nevertheless because there are genuine issues of fact in dispute summary judgment is inappropriate  another common sense approach might be for boden to call its product a florida citrus drink or a citrus punch from florida see j gilson supra §  at  footnotes omitted even though one business has established secondary meaning rights in a geographically descriptive term other businesses may still inform the public that their goods are made in the same locale section b sets forth the fair use defense and permits a defendant in an infringement action to make nontrademark use of a term which is descriptive of and used fairly and in good faith only to describe to users the goods or services of such party or their geographic origin thus he may advertise that his mens slacks are made in nashville tennessee if they are but he may not sell them as nashville brand slacks where such a use could violate the prior rights of another and result in the likelihood of confusion see  usc § b this assumes and we realize the fact is in dispute that
