slide  and i will now turn the call over to you barry barry pennypacker thanks ion and good morning everyone its been an incredibly challenging year and our team is working hard to transform manitowoc into a stronger more resilient and profitable crane company guided by the principles of the manitowoc way on our last call we indicated that cash generation was our number one priority we targeted an inventory reduction of  million and im very pleased to report that our fourth quarter reduction amounted to  million this allowed us to fully repay all borrowings under our assetbased revolver and end the year with  million in cash im really proud of our team for delivering this result and we will expand on this later in our remarks generally worldwide market conditions remains unchanged from the last quarter in the americas demand remains soft and at historically low levels due to depressed used crane values and weak rental rates we are cautiously optimistic regarding the priorities of the new us administration to invest in infrastructure but this may not quickly translate into new crane orders given the nature of the potential projects additionally the supply for underutilized cranes needs to be observed into the market before we will see any inflection in our mobile business that said as a result of our restructuring activities in the past year we are much better positioned today to swiftly react to increases in demand but we are not expecting or including any impact from the infrastructure build in our  guidance in europe revenue for the quarter was slightly better from the previous quarter and prior year we continue to see favorable customer demand driven by strength in residential and commercial construction projects our new product introductions have contributed to our european growth customers continue to receive our new selferecting hup and topslewing city class tower cranes extremely well in addition our new allterrain cranes that were introduced at bauma have done extremely well in the market the middle east crane market remains depressed while we have seen prolonged weakness in the region we remain confident that the market will eventually recover and grow particularly as oil prices continue to stabilize moving to slide  we have made significant progress in the implementation of the manitowoc way to drive our four key strategic priorities the first key element of our strategy is margin expansion we continue to align our manufacturing capacity and our build schedule to the current demand levels our relocation of crawler crane manufacturing in the us is substantially complete and the tower crane relocation in portugal remains on schedule we continue to assess the overall headcount of the business and ended the year with slightly under  employees down approximately  from a year ago our next strategic priority is growth product quality and reliability are key to a crane operations buyers decision i am pleased to report that we made significant improvements in these two areas in fact throughout the year we even delayed the launch of our grt and our gmk to ensure that these products will meet the quality expectations of our customers this is a cultural shift for our organization but we are already seeing the benefits in the eyes of our customers in terms of growing the business in new markets as i noted in last quarter three test cranes were delivered to the us army these units are undergoing testing at aberdeen maryland proving grounds which will last for approximately six months we continue to work closely with us government to ensure this crane meets their expectations upon successful completion of this project testing we anticipate beginning serial production in the fourth quarter of  our third strategic priority is innovation in  we continue to invest in innovation while increasing our focus on the voice of customers through this process of listening to crane operators i for one have learned over the last  months that innovation in the carne industry is an elegant balance of reliability simplicity and advanced technology our commitment to product development is unwavering and i am particularly excited to showcase several new cranes at the conexpo trade show in las vegas next month we have a couple of surprises to unveil at the show one of which will be the new crane that i referred to in past conference calls if you remember i challenged our team last february to develop the bestinclass crane from scratch in six months i am proud to say that the team has exceeded my expectations in fact we have already received several orders for this new truckmounted crane lastly our fourth key strategic priority is velocity simply put velocity refers to creating a culture of continuous improvement adding value in every aspect of every job every day velocity touches all of our key priorities using the principles of the manitowoc way we continue to hold manitowoc way summits where we train our employees to use lean tools which will continue to deliver results in eliminating waste and improving productivity the best example i can provide on velocity given my recent visit to wilhelmshaven germany where we manufacture allterrain cranes the team is been doing a lot of work improving the manufacturing of booms we recently invested in some new machining and robotic technology that significantly reduced the amount of change over as well as improves flow in the plan however much to my surprise after training the team created four small feeder cells in early january they moved four machining centers meters from the machine shop into the fabrication shop in doing so they integrated the fabrication of the manufacturing end processes created a pull system with the main boom manufacturing line and eliminated all the transactions in between thank you to the team for a job well done and i look forward to the continued transformation of this location as well as all of our others before i turn the call back to david i like to comment on our revenue guidance for  you received last evening as you may recall a portion of our backlog a significant portion of our backlog entering  was vpc crawler cranes that have been booked in prior years when i joined the company the first priority of my new assembled operationally focused team was the ship these late orders so customers could experience the benefits of this new crane in doing so in the first half of  our revenue included these cranes which unfortunately due to current market conditions we are not expected to repeat in  for the past few quarters i said that market conditions are basically stable however at a very low base in support of our revenue guidance for  if you annualize the second half of  youll ride approximately our  revenue guidance this fact was the major driving force in a decision to relocate crawler production to shady grove pennsylvania and with that ill turn the call over to david and he can walk us through the financials david dave antoniuk thanks barry and good morning everyone lets move the slide  for the fourth quarter orders were  million compared to  million in the third quarter of  and  million in the fourth quarter of  we reported net sales for the fourth quarter of  million which decreased  million or  from a year ago the yearoveryear revenue decrease was attributable to softness in the americas middle east partly offset by higher sales in europe sga costs for the fourth quarter  were  million which is  million lower than the prior year and  million lower than the third quarter  compared to the prior year sga costs benefited from lower headcount a net benefit of approximately  million mainly due to incentive compensation lower depreciation and general reductions in discretionary spending third quarter  sga costs included a nonrecurring charge related to declines in the fair market values of used cranes which did not repeat in the fourth quarter additionally the fourth quarter also reflected lower compensation costs as compared to the previous quarter gaap operating loss in the fourth quarter was  million compared to a loss of  million for the fourth quarter of the previous year on a nongaap adjusted basis our operating loss in the fourth quarter was  million or negative  compared to a nongaap adjusted operating income of  million or  in the prior year this result was on the better end of our guidance of negative  to negative  nongaap adjusted operating income was negatively impacted by the yearoveryear sales decline of  million coupled with manufacturing related costs caused by a significant reduction in the production of our mobile cranes to improve our inventory levels the costs associated with the sales decline to reduce planned activities were partly offset by the reductions in sga starting in  the company will begin to provide guidance on a nongaap adjusted ebitda the sole difference between nongaap adjusted operating results and nongaap adjusted ebitda is depreciation we have provided a quarterly schedule for  in our press release to bridge nongaap adjusted operating results to nongaap adjusted ebitda for your reference our nongaap adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter was a loss of  million compared to income of  million for the previous year and a loss of  million in the third quarter historically the company accounted its inventory at the manitowoc crawler facility under the lifo method as part of the relocation of its crawler crane manufacturing operations from manitowoc to shady grove and to become consistent across the enterprise the company elected to adopt the fifo method of accounting for these inventories in the fourth quarter of  accordingly all scheduled in the press release have been updated to reflect this change during the fourth quarter net cash flows from continuing operating activities was  million versus  million in the prior year inventory declines in the fourth quarter of both  and  were the main contributors to the positive cash flows in each quarter capital expenditures for the fourth quarter totaled  million which was in line with our expectations and compared to  million in the prior year backlog at quarter end was  million a decrease of  million or  from the third quarter of  and a decrease of  from the prior year period at december   our total liquidity was approximately  million comprised with  million in cash and  million in net availability on our assetbased revolver this compares to our total liquidity of approximately  million as of september   the increase in liquidity was due to our effective working capital management during the fourth quarter in which we reduced our inventory levels by approximately  million turning to slide  we are providing our  full year guidance to reflect the realities of the current macroeconomic environment end market accordingly our  full year guidance is as follows revenue down approximately  to  yearoveryear nongaap adjusted ebitda up approximately  million to  million nongaap adjusted operating income percent of approximately  to  depreciation approximately  million to  million amortization of intangibles approximately  million to  million and capital expenditures approximately  million i will now turn the call back to barry for some closing remarks barry barry pennypacker thanks david while the current market conditions remain challenging we are controlling every aspect of cost that we can we are improving the quality of our products we are expanding our market position we continue to rollout our lean initiatives in a way that benefits us now and in the future we continue to have a disciplined approach the new product development which is working in november we had the opportunity to show  investors some of things that were doing to transformers shady grove facility and once you understand the shady grove is not unique this is happening in all of our operations positioning us to realize substantial incremental profit improvement when the market recovers the organization is embracing our new culture driven by customer feedback this new level of commitment listening to and acting upon customers needs will be evident at conexpo in addition to the new truck crane that ive been talking about over the last couple of conference calls our team has also developed a ton fixed counterweight lattice boom crane that complements our vpc product offering and one other product that you will have to come to the show to learn about another crane that was developed from scratch in less than six months my only hope is that you can see what i can see a great company in the making with that ill turn the call back over to ion and introduce the questionandanswer session ion warner alright thank you barry and dave operator please provide instructions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions we will take our first question from steven fisher with ubs steven fisher what is your expectation for cash to be generated in  after the nice quarter and the fourth quarter and how much of that would be inventoried reductions specifically and then i guess you know as part of that how much cost do you expect for cash restructuring in  barry pennypacker ill let david give you the cash number but from an operational standpoint i can tell you that we have targeted incremental  million over the year in inventory reduction to contribute to our overall working capital reduction and ultimately our cash flow but david you can provide more color dave antoniuk thanks very much for the question overall we anticipate being cash positive for the year as barry has indicated we have a focus on working capital management we do have some headwinds in our project green budget green moving the crawler manufacturing from manitowoc to shady grove but we anticipate that we will be cash positive at the end of the year now that being said we will be cash negative in the first quarter which is consistent with prior years steven fisher okay thats helpful back at the investor day you were talking about some of these sizable projects that had the potential to come through any time now what is the bid pipeline of sizable projects look like at this point project where you could maybe see crane packages of  million plus and then to what extent are you finding that these projects are specking in used cranes versus new cranes barry pennypacker excellent question with regards to the actual market for the large packages there are still a number of those out there unfortunately they are moving to the south as far as timing is concerned in fact im not sure if everyone has seen or not that ryan – ryan came out this morning and said that they are not even going to be talking about infrastructure to the mid spring so thats going to cause the large projects that are counting on that funding to continue to move to the south and were continuing to go after those im pleased to say that in the quarter there was a large india order for excess of  million for large package of cranes and due to technology due to support due to overall expectations of this large customer we were able to land that order so were being very aggressive globally on these large packages and for the first time i think weve got a product portfolio that puts us in the game operator and we will now hear from seth weber with rbc capital markets seth weber wanted to ask the production cut on the mobile crane business in the fourth quarter is that – has that – are you kind of right sized there currently or do you anticipate more production cuts here to start the year is my first question barry pennypacker no we are exactly where we thought we would be we have the product lines producing at the lower levels that we anticipated we are utilizing some government activities that allow us to work short weeks in places like germany so the answer to your question is where we wanted production cut and inventory out of the system that has been accomplished seth weber then i guess at the analyst meeting you talked about a bigger or youve been talking about a bigger push towards the aftermarket in the crane care business can you comment if – was crane care revenue up in the quarter yearoveryear and can you just talk about if it was is that a function of tower rebuild or whats driving that still thank you barry pennypacker i can tell you that our percentage of revenue in the quarter was up in aftermarket and im very pleased by that we continue to build our team globally to take what aftermarket is available to us we continue to work with our supply base to privately brand some of the products that you know have been historically branded by our suppliers and that our ultimate customers are able to go to their local stores and buy the things directly from them but i think youve also heard me talk about that i think its extremely important that in order to build a longterm successful aftermarket you have to build the hookin at the sale what i mean by that is that as you are developing a new product you have to have the aftermarket in mind so that you can build things into the aftermarket that – into the product that are going to allow the aftermarket to not only come back to you for those products but have it be proprietary i think you will find in some of the technology in particular in two of the new cranes that we are introducing at conexpo we will have aftermarket build into them as a result of the development effort and thats the first time that i can say that weve got a product out there where we can say that and i will tell you that this technology that weve developed has the potential to go across the entire product portfolio on rubber based mobile cranes and im extremely impressed with what the teams are doing and i think its just going to take a while longer before we can actually see that revenue stream truly affect our longterm pl operator and our next participant is robert wertheimer with barclays robert wertheimer so just wanted to ask and obviously you guys used a much higher grade steel than some of the headline indices and so have you seen steel cost inflect up yet and does it seem and is it a headwind within your outlook and i guess i missed the change if i heard it right on the call from lifo to fifo in the press release but does that mean so youve done that i guess for  and would it have been materially different if youve done lifo in other words youve already see the steel cost starting to come in barry pennypacker ill let david handle the lifofifo deal but i will tell you that there are some headwinds in our forecast for  particularly in some higher grade steels that only come from a few steel mills around world and we are very aware of that and where that has happened we have activities in place to ensure that we dont see margin degradation as a result of that dave antoniuk robert with regard to the change from lifo to fifo for the manitowoc inventories really had nothing to do with the raw material cost of the business it had more to do with the fact that this facility was the only facility that was on lifo as you are aware we have significant net operating losses and the amount of taxable income generated by this is not going to result in any tax impact at all so its not – it will be a noncash transaction for the most part so it puts us on one platform as a fifo company enables us to use one erp system where we had actually duplicate erp system between the two location so from a simplistic standpoint it adds to the simplicity as well but really nothing about raw material input cost was involved in that robert wertheimer then if i can ask a general and a specific question i mean you guys monitor the used crane pricing much more closer than we would whats your sense as to whether anythings being mopped up and some of the optimism that coming whether or not really maybe rental companies are and then generally speaking on boom cranes do we have a chance of actually starting at age out the   or   or  stuff yet in and starting to get more replacement over the next three to four years when do you think that that actually might start to become a positive dynamic rather than maybe oversaturation thanks barry pennypacker okay very good question i will say that used prices are still down youre absolutely right its one of the key metrics that we monitor and i will tell you that the first big opportunity to understand where used crane pricing is going to be for this year is the upcoming orlando auction in february by ritchie bros that historically has set the tone for the year and were anxious to see where that ends up with regard to boom trucks i can honestly say that we are seeing increased activity in boom trucks and thats a positive and as you know sometimes that is a leading indicator but were just remaining cautiously optimistic and sizing our operations to the revenue guidance that we gave and there is upside in that that will be a wonderful thing operator and our next question comes from mike shlisky with seaport global mike shlisky so just kind of followup on your last comment there one of your big competitors in the smaller truckmounted crane category youre seeing some pretty meaningful backlog improvements and is looking in for some pretty good growth to start the new year i know that national crane is now your biggest brand so could you maybe comment on the orders you now look for national crane as a whole here barry pennypacker yeah when i talk about boom trucks and that is our national crane offering to the market as i said it is getting better and to move our total backlog when it is not a large portion of our overall revenue would be crazy to say but our orders are picking up and there are substantial for us and fortunately for us we have spent a substantial amount of time when the boom truck market was depressed in investing in the manufacturing operations there so while historically us as well as others may build backlog due to our transformation of the manufacturing operation were able to shift much quicker so thats being known by our customers and as its known by our customers they have a tendency to now allow us to not have this significant backlog like weve always had its more or less a call we produce and ship it is important also to recognize that this is – although this is a smaller portion of our business its one that we continue to invest it weve recently introduced two new units to the market and theyre being received extremely well mike shlisky got it so there is more bookings earned within the quarter or within a few months barry pennypacker correct mike shlisky and just earlier you had touched on that could be something of an early indicator as we do see some of these smaller cranes et cetera as you look back to history can you just give us a sense as to what kind of last time takes on the smaller stuff on the crane pickup how long might it take for some of their categories to improve in your experience barry pennypacker when we see its a multifunctional approach but i think one of the things that we have to look at first in order to understand where were at with regards to the market is rig count and as we follow rig count we see boom trucks go first and then after boom trucks thats when the balance of the market of our piece really starts to kick in so rig count is a leading indicator which will increase show an increase logical increase in boom trucks and once rig count passes a certain level then we bring in truckmounts and our at product line operator and our next participant is jamie cook with credit suisse jamie cook hello i guess a couple of questions one just in terms of the profitability the cadence for the year or anything unusual this year should we expect you are more profitable in the back half of the year or lose more in the first half of the year i am just trying to understand how we should think about that with savings rolling in or how we are thinking about material costs and being able to capture that and then my second question on your sales guidance do you assume any market share gains to hit your numbers or thats just more market related dave antoniuk jamie ill take the first the profitability so historically and its going to be no exception for  the first quarter will be challenging relative because where our backlog is at this point and the sales mix that well have there so as far as profitability goes the first quarter will be a little bit challenging for us and in going forward we would anticipate that q q and q will be better months enabling us to get to the longterm goal well provide some color on the quarters in later on as we get through the first quarter barry pennypacker go ahead jamie cook i was going to say i know i asked whats implied with  with market share versus end market demand but i guess i am just trying to think about too how do you think conexpo plays into sort or order activity this year i mean like its generally tends to be a larger event i mean do you think that distorts orders for the year i guess if you can give more color on that thanks barry pennypacker well what i would say about conexpo is that we are presenting to the market a new manitowoc well have a total of nine cranes on display at the show this year seven of those cranes have been developed within the last six months the other two have been within the last  months so we are showing the market that we are a company that listens to their needs develops what helps them improve their return on invested capital and i believe that this show will be an ordertaking show however we cannot forget whats the true underlying market conditions currently are and in past conexpos weve looked and yes its been a huge ordertaking shows but market conditions have been different but i do believe and we will report as i think is necessary well report an impact of conexpo in our new products on our order intake rate in the first quarter when well do the call operator and our next question comes from jerry revich with goldman sachs jerry revich i am wondering if you could just bridge for us the  million in guided ebitda improvements  versus  just the underlying components what are you folks assuming for price versus raw material costs in the structural cost improvements action can you just flesh that out a bit for us the underlying pieces on that bridge dave antoniuk yeah at a high level jerry i think our sales obviously are down significantly so we have the headwind from the down sales however we believe that we can make a lot of that up from our improvements that we made in our manufacturing facilities and then our sga costs we believe that we can still get doubledigit improvement in our sga costs which is going to lead us to the improvement in the ebitda results yearoveryear jerry revich in terms of the cadence of the sga and manufacturing cost savings can you just help us understand how the momentum is expected to build over the course of the year your exit rate in the fourth quarter will be how much higher than the savings in the first quarter or if you want to frame it in another way just for context for us dave antoniuk yeah i think that when you look at where were going to be we are going to be probably a little bit up on sga in the first quarter just because of a few items that are impacting us but we anticipate those coming down throughout the year i mean our overall – we anticipate some consulting fees going down as well as some salary still continuing to go down so well have a nice gain there as far as the manufacturing side with lower production we have lower earned hours so a lot of the benefits that we have in the production are going to be eaten up by the simple fact that our earned hours on a yearoveryear basis are going to decline mainly because of the sales decline mainly because of the sales decline that we have as mentioned in barrys prepared remarks associated with the carryover of crawler manufacturing jerry revich and lastly one of the big items you spoke about was standardization of components post the product rollout that youve spoken about at conexpo how far along are you in that process whats the overall sku or platform reductions that you folks will be targeting and where are you in that process post the products you are introducing at conexpo barry pennypacker i think you need to give us a little bit more time to give you accurate data on sku reduction however i think you will see with these seven new cranes that are mixed between tower rts ats and crawlers i think you will see that the commonality of components that we are speaking about are evident on these new products so you need to just give me a little bit more time to quantify that and i think within the next quarter i think well be able to report on that but i will tell you that you will see when you go to if you have the opportunity to attend conexpo you will see the commonality of components across the platform operator and we will now hear from stanley elliott with stifel stanley elliott a quick question for you on the new products at conexpo i mean obviously in the past it has been a good order show for you guys when would these products be able to start shipping is that by the end of the year or is that going to be fall into early  and id be curious kind of what are your expectations or how does this show going to factor into the down  of the revenue base if it does at all barry pennypacker well i dont think the show factors into it very much at all one of the new products that i talked about that i mentioned and i kind of gave a little bit more color as to what it was i mentioned the word truckmounted cranes and that is the crane that we developed in six months with superior i think lifting technology for the industry that crane in and of itself is in production today and so that impact will be immediate the new rt that will be talked about at the show will be in the second half of the year the tower cranes that you will see are immediate and the new allterrain crane will be in the second half of the year also operator our next question comes from ann duignan with jpmorgan tom simonitsch this is tom simonitsch on behalf of ann can you give us some color on your balance of us imports and exports best in terms of finished products and raw materials barry pennypacker so i think that when you look at our balance obviously the steel component we source from overseas into the us you know for product lines that are produced in germany primarily the ats we come in from germany and then in the us we ship rts from the middle east so certainly thats kind of where were at i think on the balance when you look at things when you look at the rts that we produce in the us for the us market and what we export and you look at the ats that we produce in europe for the european market and what we export to the us i think in general when you look at our revenue base were pretty well balanced as david mentioned i think on the raw material side however due to some of the steel that we use that is not produced in the us you know we have an imbalance there on the raw material side operator we will now hear from nicole deblase with deutsche bank nicole deblase so in your revenue guidance what have you assumed for currency headwinds dave antoniuk more or less flat from where we ended the year nicole deblase got it and then from a backlog perspective i know you – i understand the methodology that you are using to capture  guidance basically annualizing the second half of  but it seems based on the backlog decline that weve seen in  and the  decline in orders that you are embedding a bit of an improvement in order activity so im just curious if you look across like your product lines and geographies where you are more optimistic about improvements barry pennypacker well i would tell you that we are expecting improvement to continue in our tower business in europe thats very evidenced by our incoming order rate thus far in january we are expecting improvement in europe in some of our at business due to the new products that we introduced i happen to had the opportunity to be in europe and visit with some of these large customers a few weeks ago and i will tell you that while on the large crawler side of the business which you know happens to be a affected by lack of public funding after this year there which would affect crawler business which we dont have currently in europe its good though for maintenance which is the at product line that we have a pretty good position in and where we have spent a significant amount of our new product development activity and i think now are proving to the customers that i met with that we have a very viable product line for them and as they make their decisions to redeploy crawlers to other wind markets it should drive some substantial increases for us in the second half of the year for our at product line operator we will now hear from mig dobre with r w baird joe grabowski its joe grabowski on for mig this morning you mentioned earlier that once the us rig count reaches a certain level it drives demand for a broader range of cranes and weve seen the us rig count improve from  to  over the last seven or eight months or so im just wondering how close are we to reaching that certain level and whats kind of the cadence of what types of cranes come back once we – once the rig count goes up from here barry pennypacker weve looked at in the history of our correlation of revenue to the oil and gas business is not directly tied to rig count indirectly it is but the more driving factor for our business is  a barrel historically from where were at today if you look at where rig count is to price of oil and the number or rigs that would be put into the market should oil go above  that could account for as many as  rigs and that  rigs would definitely drive demand for our key product line even in the current marketplace of oversupply operator and with no further questions in the queue id like to turn the call back over to mr warner for closing remarks ion warner thank you before we conclude todays call please note that a replay of our fourth quarter conference call will be posted later this morning by
