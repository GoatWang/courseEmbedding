capercaillie prairie chickens and ptarmigan  are distributed throughout the forests grasslands and tundra of europe asia and north america today many grouse populations are in decline and the conservation and management of these charismatic birds is becoming a global concern this volume summarizes current knowledge of grouse biology in  chapters contributed by  researchers from field studies around the world organized in four sections  spatial ecology habitat relationships population biology and conservation and management  the chapters offer important insights into spatial requirements movements and demography of grouse much of the research employs emerging tools in ecology that span biogeochemistry molecular genetics endocrinology radiotelemetry and remote sensing the chapters explore topics including the impacts of climate change energy development and harvest and give new evidence for lifehistory changes in response to human activitiesshow more product details

grouse of the northern hemisphere have been bellwether agents for population ecology and conservation this book will help bring our knowledge of these birds together both to increase our ecological understanding of grouse and to improve our conservation efforts for these birds charles j krebs professor emeritus of zoology university of british columbia a marvelous feast of field studies especially for researchers working with dwindling and threatened populations focusing on habitat relationships and population biology this book is a sumptuous meal for avian researchers paul johnsgard professor emeritus university of nebraskalincoln and author of grassland grouse and their conservation this volume is exciting from the perspective of a grouse biologist but also from a more general ecological perspective it provides an excellent synthesis of the ecology and conservation of these fascinating and beautiful inhabitants and their ecosystems which are as diverse as tundra forest and
