early historyedit san francisco gasedit in the s manufactured gas was introduced in the united states as a means of lighting gasworks were built in the larger eastern american cities but there was no gas industry in the west however in san francisco street lighting was available only on merchant street in the form of oil lamps three brothers—peter james and michael donahue—became interested in gas manufacturing while running the foundry that later became union iron works the largest shipbuilding operation on the west coast joseph g eastland an engineer and clerk at the foundry joined them in gathering as much information on gas making as they could find in july  james applied for and received from the common council of the city of san francisco a franchise to erect a gasworks lay pipes in the streets and install street lamps to light the city with brilliant gas the council specified that gas should be supplied to households at such rates as will make it to their interest to use it in preference to any other material– the donahue brothers and eastland incorporated the san francisco gas company on august   with  of authorized capital the company became the first gas utility in the west its official seal bore the inscription fiat lux—let there be light—the same slogan later adopted by the university of california there were  original stockholders and the three donahue brothers subscribed for  of the  shares the original location for the gas works was bounded by first fremont howard and natoma streets south of market on the then shore of the san francisco bay work on the plant started in november  and it was ready for operation only a few months later on the night of february   the streets of san francisco were for the first time lighted by gas to celebrate the event the company held a gala banquet at the oriental hotel gas lighting quickly gained public favor in the first year of operation there were  customers that number more than doubled the next year to  by the end of  the company had laid more than  ½ miles of pipe and  street lamps were in operation the growing popularity of gas light led to the establishment of competing gas companies including aubin patent gas company and citizens gas company these smaller companies were quickly acquired by the san francisco gas company however one rival provided serious competition– the city gas company was founded in april  by the bank of california to compete with the gas monopoly held by the donahue brothers operation city gas began operation in  and initiated a price war with the san francisco gas company– in  the companies negotiated their consolidation as a compromise and the bank of california gained part ownership of the most lucrative gas monopoly in the west on april   the san francisco gas light company was formed representing a merger of the san francisco gas company the city gas company and the metropolitan gas company– san francisco gas and electricedit gas utilities including san francisco gas light faced new competition with the introduction of electric lighting to california– according to a  pge publication and their  commissioned history in  san francisco was the first city in the us to have a central generating station for electric customers to stay competitive the san francisco gas light company introduced the argand lamp that same year the lamp increased the light capacity of gas street lamps but proved to be an expensive improvement and was not generally adopted– meanwhile the demand for electric light in the stores and factories of downtown san francisco continued to grow the first electric street light was erected in  in front of city hall and the electrical grid supporting it was gradually extended a second generating station was constructed in  by the california electric light company to increase production capacity– new competition also emerged in the s in the form of water gas an improved illuminant patented by thaddeus lowe the united gas improvement company a water gas manufacturer organized after purchasing the lowe gas patents acquired a lease and then an interest in san franciscos central gas light company on november  – united was acquired by the pacific gas improvement company in  under the management of president albert miller pacific gas improvement developed into a formidable competitor to san francisco gas light– horace a miller secretary and c o g miller christian otto gerberding miller president owned and controlled not only the pacific gas improvement company but also the pacific gas lighting company pacific lighting company cog miller is buried in a pyramid mausoleum at mountain view cemetery oakland ca horace miller built an enormous mansion in piedmont ca at  mountain avenue in  designed by arthur brown famous san francisco architect in  san francisco gas light built its own water gas plant at the potrero gas works the manufacturing of water gas proved successful due to the increased availability of inexpensive petroleum the company decided to construct a modern gas works with both updated water gas manufacturing technology and a modern coalgas plant as a hedge against shortages in the supply of oil in  the north beach gas works was completed under the direction of san francisco gas light president and engineer joseph b crockett the facility was the largest gas holder in the us west of chicago in  the edison light and power company merged with the san francisco gas light company to form the new san francisco gas and electric companyconsolidation of gas and electric companies solved problems for both utilities by eliminating competition and producing economic savings through joint operation– other companies that began operation as active competitors but eventually merged into the san francisco gas and electric company included the equitable gas light company the independent electric light and power company and the independent gas and power company in  the company purchased its main competitor for gas lighting the pacific gas improvement company– pacific gas and electric companyedit pacific gas and electric company plant in sacramento  according to pges  history timeline on their webpage the san francisco gas and electric company and the california gas and electric corporation merged to form the pacific gas and electric company pge on october   the consolidation provided the california gas and electric corporation with access to the large san francisco market and a base for further financing the san francisco gas and electric company in turn was able to reinforce its electric system which until then had been powered entirely by steamoperated generating plants and could not compete with lower cost hydroelectric power– after the merger was formally completed engineers and management from both organizations formulated plans for coordinating and unifying the two gas and electric systems– however the two firms maintained separate corporate identities until – pges natural gas transmission system serving millions of california homes pge began delivering natural gas to san francisco and northern california in  through the longest pipeline in the world connecting the texas gas fields to northern california with compressor stations that included cooling towers every  miles  km at topock arizona on the state line and near the town of hinkley california with the introduction of natural gas the company began retiring its polluting gas manufacturing facilities though it kept some plants on standby today there is a network of eight compressor stations linked by  miles of distribution pipelines and over  miles of transportation pipelines serving  million customers from bakersfield to the oregon border in the s and s at both topock and hinkley compressor stations hexavalent chromium in the form of an additive was used in rustprevention in the cooling towers that prepared the gas for transportation through pge’s pipeline to northern and central california these cooling waters were then disposed of adjacent to the compressor stations in  charles m coleman—who worked for pges publicity department—completed his book entitled p g and e of california the centennial story of pacific gas and electric company – the  san francisco earthquakeedit pge was significantly affected by the  san francisco earthquake the companys assorted central offices were damaged by the quake and destroyed by the subsequent fire its san francisco gas and electric company subsidiary in particular suffered significant infrastructure loss as its distribution systems—miles of gas mains and electric wires—were dissevered only two gas and two electric plants all located far from the city survived the destruction– these functioning facilities—including the new foot crude oil gas works at potrero point—played critical roles in san franciscos rebuilding efforts many of pges utility competitors ceased operation following the great earthquake however the companys substantial capital allowed it to survive rebuild and expand sacramento electric gas and railway companyedit in  pge purchased the sacramento electric gas and railway company and took control of its railway operations in and around sacramento the sacramento city street railway began operating under the pacific gas  electric name in  and its track and services subsequently expanded by  the sacramento street railway division operated  streetcars on  miles  km of track pges streetcars were powered by the companys hydroelectric plant in folsom in  pge sold the rail service to pacific city lines which was later acquired by national city lines several streetcar lines were soon converted to bus service and the track was abandoned entirely in  during this same period pacific city lines and its successor national city lines with funding from general motors firestone tire standard oil of california through a subsidiary federal engineering phillips petroleum and mack trucks were buying streetcar lines and rapidly converting most of them to bus service this consortium was convicted in  of federal charges involving conspiracy to monopolize interstate commerce in the sale of buses and supplies to national city lines and its subsidiaries the actions became known as the great american streetcar scandal or the general motors streetcar conspiracy further consolidation and expansionedit pge general office building in san francisco within a few years of its incorporation pge made significant inroads into northern californias hydroelectric industry through purchase of existing water storage and conveyance facilities these included many reservoirs dams ditches and flumes built by mining interests in the sierras that were no longer commercially viable by  pge was the largest integrated utility system on the pacific coast the company handled  percent of the electric and gas business in california its operations spanned  square miles across  counties the company expanded in the s through strategic consolidation important acquisitions during this period included the california telephone and light company the western states gas and electric company and the sierra and san francisco power company which provided hydropower to san franciscos streetcars– these three companies added valuable properties and power and water sources by the end of  pge had nearly one million customers and provided electricity to  northern californian communities– in  pge purchased majority stock holdings in two major californian utility systems—great western power and san joaquin light and power—from the north american company a new york investment firm in return north american received shares of pges common stock worth  million pge also gained control of two smaller utilities midland counties public service and the fresno water company which was later sold the acquisition of these utilities did not result in an immediate merger of property and personnel the great western power company and the san joaquin company remained separate corporate entities for several more years but through this final major consolidation pge soon served nearly all of northern and central california through one integrated system– natural gasedit the gas industry market structure was dramatically altered by the discovery of massive natural gas fields throughout the american southwest beginning in  the fuel was cleaner than manufactured gas and less expensive to produce while natural gas sources were abundant in southern california no economical sources were available in northern california in  pge constructed a mile pipeline from the kettleman oil field to bring natural gas to san francisco the city became the first major urban area to switch from manufactured gas to natural gas the transition required the adjustment of burners and airflow valves on  million appliances in  pge expanded distribution with an additional mile pipeline from milpitas pge gradually retired its gas manufacturing facilities although some plants were kept on standby defense activities boosted natural gas sales in california during world war ii but cut deeply into the states natural reserves– in  pge entered into a contract with the southern california gas company and the southern counties gas company to purchase natural gas through a new mile pipeline running from texas and new mexico to los angeles– another agreement was reached with the el paso natural gas company of texas for gas delivery to the californiaarizona border in  pge completed a mile main that connected with the el paso network at the state line– during this period of expansion pge was involved in legal proceedings with the securities and exchange commission regarding the companys status as a subsidiary of the north american company as outlined by the public utility holding company act of  a utility subsidiary was defined as a utility company with more than  of their stock held by a public utility holding company though  of pge stock was held by the north american company at this time pge filed with the sec to be exempted from subsidiary status on the grounds that  ownership did not give the north american company control and because the north american company occupied only two board member spots– the north american company backed pges request by stating that they were involved in business operations in a limited capacity the request remained unresolved until  when the north american company sold off stocks that brought its ownership to below  the sec then ruled that pge was not a subsidiary of the north american company in  the north american company sold its remaining stock in pge– nuclear plants and gas pipelinesedit in  the company brought vallecitos nuclear center the first privately owned and operated nuclear reactor in the united states online in pleasanton california the reactor initially produced  kilowatts of power enough to power a town of  in addition to nuclear power pge continued to develop natural gas supplies as well in  the company began working to obtain approval for the import of a large quantity of natural gas from alberta canada to california via a pipeline constructed by westcoast transmission co and the alberta and southern gas company on the canadian side and by pacific gas transmission company a subsidiary of pge on the us side construction of the pipeline lasted  months testing began in  and the completed mile pipeline was dedicated in early  pge began construction on another nuclear facility the diablo canyon power plant in  originally slated to come online in  the plants opening was delayed for several years due to environmental protests and concerns over the safety of the plant’s construction testing of the plant began in  and energy production was brought up to full power in  during the construction of the diablo canyon plant pge continued its efforts to bring natural gas supplies from the north to their service area in california in  the company began exploring possibilities for a mile pipeline from alaska which would travel through the mackenzie river valley and on to join with the previously constructed pipeline originating in alberta in  the mackenzie valley pipeline project received approval from the us federal power commission and support from the carter administration the pipeline still required approval from canada however plans for the pipeline were placed on hold in  by a canadian judge justice thomas r berger of british columbia shelved the project for at least  years citing concerns from first nations groups whose land the pipeline would have traversed as well as potential environmental impacts in  the greatgrandson of pges founder george h roe—david roe published his book entitled dynamos and virgins during the time when there was a growing antinuclearpower movement david roe who was an environmentalist and the environmental defense funds west coast general counsel mounted an assault on the longstanding assumption that steady growth in coal and nucleargenerating capacity was the only solution to the nations energy needs he based his arguments on an economic analysis aimed at showing that a shift to energy conservation and alternative energy sources alone could slake the thirst for electricity postwar eraedit as of december  pge operated  electric generating units and  generating stations  miles  km of transmission lines and  miles  km of distribution system in  pge reorganized as a holding company pge corporation it consisted of two subsidiaries—pge the regulated utility and a nonregulated energy business in the later s under electricity market deregulation this utility sold off most of its natural gas power plants the utility retained all of its hydroelectric plants the diablo canyon power plant and a few natural gas plants but the large natural gas plants it sold made up a large portion of its generating capacity this had the effect of requiring the utility to buy power from the energy generators at fluctuating prices while being forced to sell the power to consumers at a fixed cost however the market for electricity was dominated by the enron corporation which with help from other corporations artificially pushed prices for electricity ever higher this led to the california electricity crisis that began in  on path  a transmission corridor pge built with a critical power shortage rolling blackouts began on january   bankruptcyedit main article california electricity crisis in  a change in the regulation of californias public utilities including pge began the california public utility commission cpuc set the rates that pge could charge customers and required them to provide as much power as the customers wanted at rates set by the cpuc in the summer of  a drought in the northwest states and in california reduced the amount of hydroelectric power available usually pge could buy cheap hydroelectric power under long term contracts with the bonneville dam etc drought and delays in approval of new power plants and market manipulation decreased available electric power generation capacity that could be generated in state or bought under long term contracts out of state hot weather brought on higher usage rolling blackouts etc with little excess generating capacity of its own pge was forced to buy electricity out of state from suppliers without long term contracts because pge had to buy additional electricity to meet demand some suppliers took advantage of this requirement and manipulated the market by creating artificial shortages and charged very high electrical rates the cpuc refused to adjust the allowable electric rates unable to change rates and sell electricity to consumers for what it cost them on the open market pge started hemorrhaging cash pge company the utility not the holding company entered bankruptcy under chapter  on april   the state of california tried to bail out the utility and provide power to pges  million customers under the same rules that required the state to buy electricity at market rate high cost to meet demand and sell it at lower fixed price and as a result the state also lost significant amounts of money the crisis cost pge and the state somewhere between  and  billion there is some evidence that this crisis played an important part in the eventual recall of california governor gray davis pge company the utility emerged from bankruptcy in april  after paying  billion to its

sites on the surface of the earth according to pge spokesman jonathan marshall energy purchase costs are expected to be similar to other renewable energy contracts pge and the environmentedit beginning in the mids regulatory and political developments began to push utilities in california away from a traditional business model in  the california state legislature amended the warrenalquist act which created and gives legal authority to the california energy commission to effectively prohibit the construction of new nuclear power plants the environmental defense fund edf filed as an intervenor in pges  general rate case grc claiming that the companys requests for rate increases were based on unrealistically high projections of load growth furthermore edf claimed that pge could more costeffectively encourage industrial cogeneration and energy efficiency than build more power plants as a result of edfs involvement in pges rate cases the company was eventually fined  million

pounds flying through the air fueled by blowing natural gas the blast created a crater at the epicenter and killed eight people and injured nearly five dozen more while destroying about  homes the usgs reported that the shock wave was similar to a  magnitude earthquake following the event the company was heavily criticized for ignoring the warnings of a state inspector in  and for failing to provide adequate safety procedures the incident then came under investigation by the national transportation safety board ntsb on august   the ntsb released its findings which placed fault for the blast on pge the report stated that the pipeline installed in  that later burst did not even meet standards of that time pge was charged with twelve criminal felony counts alleging violations of the natural gas pipeline safety act pge pleaded not guilty to the criminal counts in both the initial and superseding indictments opting to put the prosecutors to their proof on april   a united states

lighting gasworks were built in the larger eastern american cities but there was no gas industry in the west however in san francisco street lighting was available only on merchant street in the form of oil lamps three brothers—peter james and michael donahue—became interested in gas manufacturing while running the foundry that later became union iron works the largest shipbuilding operation on the west coast joseph g eastland an engineer and clerk at the foundry joined them in gathering as much information on gas making as they could find in july  james applied for and received from the common council of the city of san francisco a franchise to erect a gasworks lay pipes in the streets and install street lamps to light the city with brilliant gas the council specified that gas should be supplied to households at such rates as will make it to their interest to use it in preference to any other material– the donahue brothers and eastland incorporated the san francisco gas company on august   with  of authorized capital the company became the first gas utility in the west its official seal bore the inscription fiat lux—let there be light—the same slogan later adopted by the university of california there were  original stockholders and the three donahue brothers subscribed for  of the  shares the original location for the gas works was bounded by first fremont howard and natoma streets south of market on the then shore of the san francisco bay work on the plant started in november  and it was ready for operation only a few months later on the night of february   the streets of san francisco were for the first time lighted by gas to celebrate the event the company held a gala banquet at the oriental hotel gas lighting quickly gained public favor in the first year of operation there were  customers that number more than doubled the next year to  by the end of  the company had laid more than  ½ miles of pipe and  street lamps were in operation the growing popularity of gas light led to the establishment of competing gas companies including aubin patent gas company and citizens gas company these smaller companies were quickly acquired by the san francisco gas company however one rival provided serious competition– the city gas company was founded in april  by the bank of california to compete with the gas monopoly held by the donahue brothers operation city gas began operation in  and initiated a price war with the san francisco gas company– in  the companies negotiated their consolidation as a compromise and the bank of california gained part ownership of the most lucrative gas monopoly in the west on april   the san francisco gas light company was formed representing a merger of the san francisco gas company the city gas company and the metropolitan gas company– san francisco gas and electricedit gas utilities including san francisco gas light faced new competition with the introduction of electric lighting to california– according to a  pge publication and their  commissioned history in  san francisco was the first city in the us to have a central generating station for electric customers to stay competitive the san francisco gas light company introduced the argand lamp that same year the lamp increased the light capacity of gas street lamps but proved to be an expensive improvement and was not generally adopted– meanwhile the demand for electric light in the stores and factories of downtown san francisco continued to grow the first electric street light was erected in  in front of city hall and the electrical grid supporting it was gradually extended a second generating station was constructed in  by the california electric light company to increase production capacity– new competition also emerged in the s in the form of water gas an improved illuminant patented by thaddeus lowe the united gas improvement company a water gas manufacturer organized after purchasing the lowe gas patents acquired a lease and then an interest in san franciscos central gas light company on november  – united was acquired by the pacific gas improvement company in  under the management of president albert miller pacific gas improvement developed into a formidable competitor to san francisco gas light– horace a miller secretary and c o g miller christian otto gerberding miller president owned and controlled not only the pacific gas improvement company but also the pacific gas lighting company pacific lighting company cog miller is buried in a pyramid mausoleum at mountain view cemetery oakland ca horace miller built an enormous mansion in piedmont ca at  mountain avenue in  designed by arthur brown famous san francisco architect in  san francisco gas light built its own water gas plant at the potrero gas works the manufacturing of water gas proved successful due to the increased availability of inexpensive petroleum the company decided to construct a modern gas works with both updated water gas manufacturing technology and a modern coalgas plant as a hedge against shortages in the supply of oil in  the north beach gas works was completed under the direction of san francisco gas light president and engineer joseph b crockett the facility was the largest gas holder in the us west of chicago in  the edison light and power company merged with the san francisco gas light company to form the new san francisco gas and electric companyconsolidation of gas and electric companies solved problems for both utilities by eliminating competition and producing economic savings through joint operation– other companies that began operation as active competitors but eventually merged into the san francisco gas and electric company included the equitable gas light company the independent electric light and power company and the independent gas and power company in  the company purchased its main competitor for gas lighting the pacific gas improvement company– pacific gas and electric companyedit pacific gas and electric company plant in sacramento  according to pges  history timeline on their webpage the san francisco gas and electric company and the california gas and electric corporation merged to form the pacific gas and electric company pge on october   the consolidation provided the california gas and electric corporation with access to the large san francisco market and a base for further financing the san francisco gas and electric company in turn was able to reinforce its electric system which until then had been powered entirely by steamoperated generating plants and could not compete with lower cost hydroelectric power– after the merger was formally completed engineers and management from both organizations formulated plans for coordinating and unifying the two gas and electric systems– however the two firms maintained separate corporate identities until – pges natural gas transmission system serving millions of california homes pge began delivering natural gas to san francisco and northern california in  through the longest pipeline in the world connecting the texas gas fields to northern california with compressor stations that included cooling towers every  miles  km at topock arizona on the state line and near the town of hinkley california with the introduction of natural gas the company began retiring its polluting gas manufacturing facilities though it kept some plants on standby today there is a network of eight compressor stations linked by  miles of distribution pipelines and over  miles of transportation pipelines serving  million customers from bakersfield to the oregon border in the s and s at both topock and hinkley compressor stations hexavalent chromium in the form of an additive was used in rustprevention in the cooling towers that prepared the gas for transportation through pge’s pipeline to northern and central california these cooling waters were then disposed of adjacent to the compressor stations in  charles m coleman—who worked for pges publicity department—completed his book entitled p g and e of california the centennial story of pacific gas and electric company – the  san francisco earthquakeedit pge was significantly affected by the  san francisco earthquake the companys assorted central offices were damaged by the quake and destroyed by the subsequent fire its san francisco gas and electric company subsidiary in particular suffered significant infrastructure loss as its distribution systems—miles of gas mains and electric wires—were dissevered only two gas and two electric plants all located far from the city survived the destruction– these functioning facilities—including the new foot crude oil gas works at potrero point—played critical roles in san franciscos rebuilding efforts many of pges utility competitors ceased operation following the great earthquake however the companys substantial capital allowed it to survive rebuild and expand sacramento electric gas and railway companyedit in  pge purchased the sacramento electric gas and railway company and took control of its railway operations in and around sacramento the sacramento city street railway began operating under the pacific gas  electric name in  and its track and services subsequently expanded by  the sacramento street railway division operated  streetcars on  miles  km of track pges streetcars were powered by the companys hydroelectric plant in folsom in  pge sold the rail service to pacific city lines which was later acquired by national city lines several streetcar lines were soon converted to bus service and the track was abandoned entirely in  during this same period pacific city lines and its successor national city lines with funding from general motors firestone tire standard oil of california through a subsidiary federal engineering phillips petroleum and mack trucks were buying streetcar lines and rapidly converting most of them to bus service this consortium was convicted in  of federal charges involving conspiracy to monopolize interstate commerce in the sale of buses and supplies to national city lines and its subsidiaries the actions became known as the great american streetcar scandal or the general motors streetcar conspiracy further consolidation and expansionedit pge general office building in san francisco within a few years of its incorporation pge made significant inroads into northern californias hydroelectric industry through purchase of existing water storage and conveyance facilities these included many reservoirs dams ditches and flumes built by mining interests in the sierras that were no longer commercially viable by  pge was the largest integrated utility system on the pacific coast the company handled  percent of the electric and gas business in california its operations spanned  square miles across  counties the company expanded in the s through strategic consolidation important acquisitions during this period included the california telephone and light company the western states gas and electric company and the sierra and san francisco power company which provided hydropower to san franciscos streetcars– these three companies added valuable properties and power and water sources by the end of  pge had nearly one million customers and provided electricity to  northern californian communities– in  pge purchased majority stock holdings in two major californian utility systems—great western power and san joaquin light and power—from the north american company a new york investment firm in return north american received shares of pges common stock worth  million pge also gained control of two smaller utilities midland counties public service and the fresno water company which was later sold the acquisition of these utilities did not result in an immediate merger of property and personnel the great western power company and the san joaquin company remained separate corporate entities for several more years but through this final major consolidation pge soon served nearly all of northern and central california through one integrated system– natural gasedit the gas industry market structure was dramatically altered by the discovery of massive natural gas fields throughout the american southwest beginning in  the fuel was cleaner than manufactured gas and less expensive to produce while natural gas sources were abundant in southern california no economical sources were available in northern california in  pge constructed a mile pipeline from the kettleman oil field to bring natural gas to san francisco the city became the first major urban area to switch from manufactured gas to natural gas the transition required the adjustment of burners and airflow valves on  million appliances in  pge expanded distribution with an additional mile pipeline from milpitas pge gradually retired its gas manufacturing facilities although some plants were kept on standby defense activities boosted natural gas sales in california during world war ii but cut deeply into the states natural reserves– in  pge entered into a contract with the southern california gas company and the southern counties gas company to purchase natural gas through a new mile pipeline running from texas and new mexico to los angeles– another agreement was reached with the el paso natural gas company of texas for gas delivery to the californiaarizona border in  pge completed a mile main that connected with the el paso network at the state line– during this period of expansion pge was involved in legal proceedings with the securities and exchange commission regarding the companys status as a subsidiary of the north american company as outlined by the public utility holding company act of  a utility subsidiary was defined as a utility company with more than  of their stock held by a public utility holding company though  of pge stock was held by the north american company at this time pge filed with the sec to be exempted from subsidiary status on the grounds that  ownership did not give the north american company control and because the north american company occupied only two board member spots– the north american company backed pges request by stating that they were involved in business operations in a limited capacity the request remained unresolved until  when the north american company sold off stocks that brought its ownership to below  the sec then ruled that pge was not a subsidiary of the north american company in  the north american company sold its remaining stock in pge– nuclear plants and gas pipelinesedit in  the company brought vallecitos nuclear center the first privately owned and operated nuclear reactor in the united states online in pleasanton california the reactor initially produced  kilowatts of power enough to power a town of  in addition to nuclear power pge continued to develop natural gas supplies as well in  the company began working to obtain approval for the import of a large quantity of natural gas from alberta canada to california via a pipeline constructed by westcoast transmission co and the alberta and southern gas company on the canadian side and by pacific gas transmission company a subsidiary of pge on the us side construction of the pipeline lasted  months testing began in  and the completed mile pipeline was dedicated in early  pge began construction on another nuclear facility the diablo canyon power plant in  originally slated to come online in  the plants opening was delayed for several years due to environmental protests and concerns over the safety of the plant’s construction testing of the plant began in  and energy production was brought up to full power in  during the construction of the diablo canyon plant pge continued its efforts to bring natural gas supplies from the north to their service area in california in  the company began exploring possibilities for a mile pipeline from alaska which would travel through the mackenzie river valley and on to join with the previously constructed pipeline originating in alberta in  the mackenzie valley pipeline project received approval from the us federal power commission and support from the carter administration the pipeline still required approval from canada however plans for the pipeline were placed on hold in  by a canadian judge justice thomas r berger of british columbia shelved the project for at least  years citing concerns from first nations groups whose land the pipeline would have traversed as well as potential environmental impacts in  the greatgrandson of pges founder george h roe—david roe published his book entitled dynamos and virgins during the time when there was a growing antinuclearpower movement david roe who was an environmentalist and the environmental defense funds west coast general counsel mounted an assault on the longstanding assumption that steady growth in coal and nucleargenerating capacity was the only solution to the nations energy needs he based his arguments on an economic analysis aimed at showing that a shift to energy conservation and alternative energy sources alone could slake the thirst for electricity postwar eraedit as of december  pge operated  electric generating units and  generating stations  miles  km of transmission lines and  miles  km of distribution system in  pge reorganized as a holding company pge corporation it consisted of two subsidiaries—pge the regulated utility and a nonregulated energy business in the later s under electricity market deregulation this utility sold off most of its natural gas power plants the utility retained all of its hydroelectric plants the diablo canyon power plant and a few natural gas plants but the large natural gas plants it sold made up a large portion of its generating capacity this had the effect of requiring the utility to buy power from the energy generators at fluctuating prices while being forced to sell the power to consumers at a fixed cost however the market for electricity was dominated by the enron corporation which with help from other corporations artificially pushed prices for electricity ever higher this led to the california electricity crisis that began in  on path  a transmission corridor pge built with a critical power shortage rolling blackouts began on january   bankruptcyedit main article california electricity crisis in  a change in the regulation of californias public utilities including pge began the california public utility commission cpuc set the rates that pge could charge customers and required them to provide as much power as the customers wanted at rates set by the cpuc in the summer of  a drought in the northwest states and in california reduced the amount of hydroelectric power available usually pge could buy cheap hydroelectric power under long term contracts with the bonneville dam etc drought and delays in approval of new power plants and market manipulation decreased available electric power generation capacity that could be generated in state or bought under long term contracts out of state hot weather brought on higher usage rolling blackouts etc with little excess generating capacity of its own pge was forced to buy electricity out of state from suppliers without long term contracts because pge had to buy additional electricity to meet demand some suppliers took advantage of this requirement and manipulated the market by creating artificial shortages and charged very high electrical rates the cpuc refused to adjust the allowable electric rates unable to change rates and sell electricity to consumers for what it cost them on the open market pge started hemorrhaging cash pge company the utility not the holding company entered bankruptcy under chapter  on april   the state of california tried to bail out the utility and provide power to pges  million customers under the same rules that required the state to buy electricity at market rate high cost to meet demand and sell it at lower fixed price and as a result the state also lost significant amounts of money the crisis cost pge and the state somewhere between  and  billion there is some evidence that this crisis played an important part in the eventual recall of california governor gray davis pge company the utility emerged from bankruptcy in april  after paying  billion to its hundreds of creditors as part of the reorganization pges  million electricity customers will have to pay

was asking the california public utilities commission to approve a project by the company solaren to deliver  megawatts of power to california from space this method of obtaining electricity from the sun eliminates mostly the darkness of night experienced from solar sites on the surface of the earth according to pge spokesman jonathan marshall energy purchase costs are expected to be similar to other renewable energy contracts pge and the environmentedit beginning in the mids regulatory and political developments began to push utilities in california away from a traditional business model in  the california state legislature amended the warrenalquist act which created and gives legal authority to the california energy commission to effectively prohibit the construction of new nuclear power plants the environmental defense fund edf filed as an intervenor in pges  general rate case grc claiming that the companys requests for rate increases were based on unrealistically high projections of load growth furthermore edf claimed that pge could more costeffectively encourage industrial cogeneration and energy efficiency than build more power plants as a result of edfs involvement in pges rate cases the company was eventually fined  million by the california public utilities commission for failing to adequately implement energy efficiency programs since darbee took control of the pge company in  pge has aggressively promoted its environmental image through a variety of programs and campaignscitation needed in the early first decade of the st century the ceo of pge corporation peter darbee and thenceo of pacific gas  electric company tom king publicly announced their support for california assembly bill  a measure to cap statewide greenhouse gas emissions and a  reduction of emissions by  the bill was signed into law by governor arnold schwarzenegger on september   in  pge had a renewables mix of  disastersedit groundwater contamination in hinkley

hinkley california pge used chromium —one of the cheapest and most efficient commercially available—at their compressor station plants in their cooling towers along the natural gas transmission pipelines pge did not inform the local water board of the contamination until december   stalling action on a response to the contamination the residents of hinkley filed a successful lawsuit against pge in which the company paid  million— the largest settlement ever paid in a directaction lawsuit in us history the legal case which was dramatized in the  film erin brockovich became an international cause célèbre in response in  at the request of the calepa the chromate toxicity review committee was formed to investigate the toxicity of chromium when ingested in  a senate hearing revealed that the committees supposedlyclarification needed blueribbon members included pge defense expert witnesses who had influenced the final august  report which found in pges favor concluding that other reports were alarmist with spuriously high statistics and that further evaluation should be handled by academics in laboratory settings not by regulators through time the report was recanted but it set back regulation of chromium  for many yearscitation needed in july  california became the first state to acknowledge that ingested chromium is linked to cancer and as a result has established a maximum chromium contaminant level mcl of  parts per billion ppb in setting the regulations it was acknowledged that in recent scientific studies in laboratory animals hexavalent chromium has also been linked to cancer when ingested previously when older chromium mcls were set at the time total chromium mcls were established ingested hexavalent chromium associated with consumption of drinking water was not considered to pose a cancer risk as is now the case by  pge had cleaned up  acres but it is estimated the remediation process will take another  years pge built a

contractor that installed the meters would honor these requests pge would eventually come out and replace them despite objections subsequently the california public utilities commission would conduct an investigation and find that of the  smart meter field tests  meters were successfully tested and  passed average registration accuracy one meter was found to have serious errors and was malfunctioning on arrival while another was found to have serious event errors upon installation these meters were therefore excluded from testing proposition edit in  pge was accused of attempting to stifle competition with proposition  which mandated approval from twothirds of voters to start or expand a local utility critics argued that this would make it harder for local governments to create

san francisco gasedit in the s manufactured gas was introduced in the united states as a means of lighting gasworks were built in the larger eastern american cities but there was no gas industry in the west however in san francisco street lighting was available only on merchant street in the form of oil lamps three brothers—peter james and michael donahue—became interested in gas manufacturing while running the foundry that later became union iron works the largest shipbuilding operation on the west coast joseph g eastland an engineer and clerk at the foundry joined them in gathering as much information on gas making as they could find in july  james applied for and received from the common council of the city of san francisco a franchise to erect a gasworks lay pipes in the streets and install street lamps to light the city with brilliant gas the council specified that gas should be supplied to households at such rates as will make it to their interest to use it in preference to any other material– the donahue brothers and eastland incorporated the san francisco gas company on august   with  of authorized capital the company became the first gas utility in the west its official seal bore the inscription fiat lux—let there be light—the same slogan later adopted by the university of california there were  original stockholders and the three donahue brothers subscribed for  of the  shares the original location for the gas works was bounded by first fremont howard and natoma streets south of market on the then shore of the san francisco bay work on the plant started in november  and it was ready for operation only a few months later on the night of february   the streets of san francisco were for the first time lighted by gas to celebrate the event the company held a gala banquet at the oriental hotel gas lighting quickly gained public favor in the first year of operation there were  customers that number more than doubled the next year to  by the end of  the company had laid more than  ½ miles of pipe and  street lamps were in operation the growing popularity of gas light led to the establishment of competing gas companies including aubin patent gas company and citizens gas company these smaller companies were quickly acquired by the san francisco gas company however one rival provided serious competition– the city gas company was founded in april  by the bank of california to compete with the gas monopoly held by the donahue brothers operation city gas began operation in  and initiated a price war with the san francisco gas company– in  the companies negotiated their consolidation as a compromise and the bank of california gained part ownership of the most lucrative gas monopoly in the west on april   the san francisco gas light company was formed representing a merger of the san francisco gas company the city gas company and the metropolitan gas company– san francisco gas and electricedit gas utilities including san francisco gas light faced new competition with the introduction of electric lighting to california– according to a  pge publication and their  commissioned history in  san francisco was the first city in the us to have a central generating station for electric customers to stay competitive the san francisco gas light company introduced the argand lamp that same year the lamp increased the light capacity of gas street lamps but proved to be an expensive improvement and was not generally adopted– meanwhile the demand for electric light in the stores and factories of downtown san francisco continued to grow the first electric street light was erected in  in front of city hall and the electrical grid supporting it was gradually extended a second generating station was constructed in  by the california electric light company to increase production capacity– new competition also emerged in the s in the form of water gas an improved illuminant patented by thaddeus lowe the united gas improvement company a water gas manufacturer organized after purchasing the lowe gas patents acquired a lease and then an interest in san franciscos central gas light company on november  – united was acquired by the pacific gas improvement company in  under the management of president albert miller pacific gas improvement developed into a formidable competitor to san francisco gas light– horace a miller secretary and c o g miller christian otto gerberding miller president owned and controlled not only the pacific gas improvement company but also the pacific gas lighting company pacific lighting company cog miller is buried in a pyramid mausoleum at mountain view cemetery oakland ca horace miller built an enormous mansion in piedmont ca at  mountain avenue in  designed by arthur brown famous san francisco architect in  san francisco gas light built its own water gas plant at the potrero gas works the manufacturing of water gas proved successful due to the increased availability of inexpensive petroleum the company decided to construct a modern gas works with both updated water gas manufacturing technology and a modern coalgas plant as a hedge against shortages in the supply of oil in  the north beach gas works was completed under the direction of san francisco gas light president and engineer joseph b crockett the facility was the largest gas holder in the us west of chicago in  the edison light and power company merged with the san francisco gas light company to form the new san francisco gas and electric companyconsolidation of gas and electric companies solved problems for both utilities by eliminating competition and producing economic savings through joint operation– other companies that began operation as active competitors but eventually merged into the san francisco gas and electric company included the equitable gas light company the independent electric light and power company and the independent gas and power company in  the company purchased its main competitor for gas lighting the pacific gas improvement company– pacific gas and electric companyedit pacific gas and electric company plant in sacramento  according to pges  history timeline on their webpage the san francisco gas and electric company and the california gas and electric corporation merged to form the pacific gas and electric company pge on october   the consolidation provided the california gas and electric corporation with access to the large san francisco market and a base for further financing the san francisco gas and electric company in turn was able to reinforce its electric system which until then had been powered entirely by steamoperated generating plants and could not compete with lower cost hydroelectric power– after the merger was formally completed engineers and management from both organizations formulated plans for coordinating and unifying the two gas and electric systems– however the two firms maintained separate corporate identities until – pges natural gas transmission system serving millions of california homes pge began delivering natural gas to san francisco and northern california in  through the longest pipeline in the world connecting the texas gas fields to northern california with compressor stations that included cooling towers every  miles  km at topock arizona on the state line and near the town of hinkley california with the introduction of natural gas the company began retiring its polluting gas manufacturing facilities though it kept some plants on standby today there is a network of eight compressor stations linked by  miles of distribution pipelines and over  miles of transportation pipelines serving  million customers from bakersfield to the oregon border in the s and s at both topock and hinkley compressor stations hexavalent chromium in the form of an additive was used in rustprevention in the cooling towers that prepared the gas for transportation through pge’s pipeline to northern and central california these cooling waters were then disposed of adjacent to the compressor stations in  charles m coleman—who worked for pges publicity department—completed his book entitled p g and e of california the centennial story of pacific gas and electric company – the  san francisco earthquakeedit pge was significantly affected by the  san francisco earthquake the companys assorted central offices were damaged by the quake and destroyed by the subsequent fire its san francisco gas and electric company subsidiary in particular suffered significant infrastructure loss as its distribution systems—miles of gas mains and electric wires—were dissevered only two gas and two electric plants all located far from the city survived the destruction– these functioning facilities—including the new foot crude oil gas works at potrero point—played critical roles in san franciscos rebuilding efforts many of pges utility competitors ceased operation following the great earthquake however the companys substantial capital allowed it to survive rebuild and expand sacramento electric gas and railway companyedit in  pge purchased the sacramento electric gas and railway company and took control of its railway operations in and around sacramento the sacramento city street railway began operating under the pacific gas  electric name in  and its track and services subsequently expanded by  the sacramento street railway division operated  streetcars on  miles  km of track pges streetcars were powered by the companys hydroelectric plant in folsom in  pge sold the rail service to pacific city lines which was later acquired by national city lines several streetcar lines were soon converted to bus service and the track was abandoned entirely in  during this same period pacific city lines and its successor national city lines with funding from general motors firestone tire standard oil of california through a subsidiary federal engineering phillips petroleum and mack trucks were buying streetcar lines and rapidly converting most of them to bus service this consortium was convicted in  of federal charges involving conspiracy to monopolize interstate commerce in the sale of buses and supplies to national city lines and its subsidiaries the actions became known as the great american streetcar scandal or the general motors streetcar conspiracy further consolidation and expansionedit pge general office building in san francisco within a few years of its incorporation pge made significant inroads into northern californias hydroelectric industry through purchase of existing water storage and conveyance facilities these included many reservoirs dams ditches and flumes built by mining interests in the sierras that were no longer commercially viable by  pge was the largest integrated utility system on the pacific coast the company handled  percent of the electric and gas business in california its operations spanned  square miles across  counties the company expanded in the s through strategic consolidation important acquisitions during this period included the california telephone and light company the western states gas and electric company and the sierra and san francisco power company which provided hydropower to san franciscos streetcars– these three companies added valuable properties and power and water sources by the end of  pge had nearly one million customers and provided electricity to  northern californian communities– in  pge purchased majority stock holdings in two major californian utility systems—great western power and san joaquin light and power—from the north american company a new york investment firm in return north american received shares of pges common stock worth  million pge also gained control of two smaller utilities midland counties public service and the fresno water company which was later sold the acquisition of these utilities did not result in an immediate merger of property and personnel the great western power company and the san joaquin company remained separate corporate entities for several more years but through this final major consolidation pge soon served nearly all of northern and central california through one integrated system– natural gasedit the gas industry market structure was dramatically altered by the discovery of massive natural gas fields throughout the american southwest beginning in  the fuel was cleaner than manufactured gas and less expensive to produce while natural gas sources were abundant in southern california no economical sources were available in northern california in  pge constructed a mile pipeline from the kettleman oil field to bring natural gas to san francisco the city became the first major urban area to switch from manufactured gas to natural gas the transition required the adjustment of burners and airflow valves on  million appliances in  pge expanded distribution with an additional mile pipeline from milpitas pge gradually retired its gas manufacturing facilities although some plants were kept on standby defense activities boosted natural gas sales in california during world war ii but cut deeply into the states natural reserves– in  pge entered into a contract with the southern california gas company and the southern counties gas company to purchase natural gas through a new mile pipeline running from texas and new mexico to los angeles– another agreement was reached with the el paso natural gas company of texas for gas delivery to the californiaarizona border in  pge completed a mile main that connected with the el paso network at the state line– during this period of expansion pge was involved in legal proceedings with the securities and exchange commission regarding the companys status as a subsidiary of the north american company as outlined by the public utility holding company act of  a utility subsidiary was defined as a utility company with more than  of their stock held by a public utility holding company though  of pge stock was held by the north american company at this time pge filed with the sec to be exempted from subsidiary status on the grounds that  ownership did not give the north american company control and because the north american company occupied only two board member spots– the north american company backed pges request by stating that they were involved in business operations in a limited capacity the request remained unresolved until  when the north american company sold off stocks that brought its ownership to below  the sec then ruled that pge was not a subsidiary of the north american company in  the north american company sold its remaining stock in pge– nuclear plants and gas pipelinesedit in  the company brought vallecitos nuclear center the first privately owned and operated nuclear reactor in the united states online in pleasanton california the reactor initially produced  kilowatts of power enough to power a town of  in addition to nuclear power pge continued to develop natural gas supplies as well in  the company began working to obtain approval for the import of a large quantity of natural gas from alberta canada to california via a pipeline constructed by westcoast transmission co and the alberta and southern gas company on the canadian side and by pacific gas transmission company a subsidiary of pge on the us side construction of the pipeline lasted  months testing began in  and the completed mile pipeline was dedicated in early  pge began construction on another nuclear facility the diablo canyon power plant in  originally slated to come online in  the plants opening was delayed for several years due to environmental protests and concerns over the safety of the plant’s construction testing of the plant began in  and energy production was brought up to full power in  during the construction of the diablo canyon plant pge continued its efforts to bring natural gas supplies from the north to their service area in california in  the company began exploring possibilities for a mile pipeline from alaska which would travel through the mackenzie river valley and on to join with the previously constructed pipeline originating in alberta in  the mackenzie valley pipeline project received approval from the us federal power commission and support from the carter administration the pipeline still required approval from canada however plans for the pipeline were placed on hold in  by a canadian judge justice thomas r berger of british columbia shelved the project for at least  years citing concerns from first nations groups whose land the pipeline would have traversed as well as potential environmental impacts in  the greatgrandson of pges founder george h roe—david roe published his book entitled dynamos and virgins during the time when there was a growing antinuclearpower movement david roe who was an environmentalist and the environmental defense funds west coast general counsel mounted an assault on the longstanding assumption that steady growth in coal and nucleargenerating capacity was the only solution to the nations energy needs he based his arguments on an economic analysis aimed at showing that a shift to energy conservation and alternative energy sources alone could slake the thirst for electricity postwar eraedit as of december  pge operated  electric generating units and  generating stations  miles  km of transmission lines and  miles  km of distribution system in  pge reorganized as a holding company pge corporation it consisted of two subsidiaries—pge the regulated utility and a nonregulated energy business in the later s under electricity market deregulation this utility sold off most of its natural gas power plants the utility retained all of its hydroelectric plants the diablo canyon power plant and a few natural gas plants but the large natural gas plants it sold made up a large portion of its generating capacity this had the effect of requiring the utility to buy power from the energy generators at fluctuating prices while being forced to sell the power to consumers at a fixed cost however the market for electricity was dominated by the enron corporation which with help from other corporations artificially pushed prices for electricity ever higher this led to the california electricity crisis that began in  on path  a transmission corridor pge built with a critical power shortage rolling blackouts began on january   bankruptcyedit main article california electricity crisis in  a change in the regulation of californias public utilities including pge began the california public utility commission cpuc set the rates that pge could charge customers and required them to provide as much power as the customers wanted at rates set by the cpuc in the summer of  a drought in the northwest states and in california reduced the amount of hydroelectric power available usually pge could buy cheap hydroelectric power under long term contracts with the bonneville dam etc drought and delays in approval of new power plants and market manipulation decreased available electric power generation capacity that could be generated in state or bought under long term contracts out of state hot weather brought on higher usage rolling blackouts etc with little excess generating capacity of its own pge was forced to buy electricity out of state from suppliers without long term contracts because pge had to buy additional electricity to meet demand some suppliers took advantage of this requirement and manipulated the market by creating artificial shortages and charged very high electrical rates the cpuc refused to adjust the allowable electric rates unable to change rates and sell electricity to consumers for what it cost them on the open market pge started hemorrhaging cash pge company the utility not the holding company entered bankruptcy under chapter  on april   the state of california tried to bail out the utility and provide power to pges  million customers under the same rules that required the state to buy electricity at market rate high cost to meet demand and sell it at lower fixed price and as a result the state also lost significant amounts of money the crisis cost pge and the state somewhere between  and  billion there is some evidence that this crisis played an important part in the eventual recall of california governor gray davis pge company the utility emerged from bankruptcy in april  after paying  billion to its hundreds of creditors as part of the reorganization pges  million electricity customers will have to pay abovemarket prices for several years to cancel the debt generation portfolioedit pges

installations will initially generate enough electricity to power more than  residences in april  pges next blog reported that pge was asking the california public utilities commission to approve a project by the company solaren to deliver  megawatts of power to california from space this method of obtaining electricity from the sun eliminates mostly the darkness of night experienced from solar sites on the surface of the earth according to pge spokesman jonathan marshall energy purchase costs are expected to be similar to other renewable energy contracts pge and the environmentedit beginning in the mids regulatory and political developments began to push utilities in california away from a traditional business model in  the california state legislature amended the warrenalquist act which created and gives legal authority to the california energy commission to effectively prohibit the construction of new nuclear power plants the environmental defense fund edf filed as an intervenor in pges  general rate case grc claiming that the companys requests for rate increases were based on unrealistically high projections of load growth furthermore edf claimed that pge could more costeffectively encourage industrial cogeneration and energy efficiency than build more power plants as a result of edfs involvement in pges rate cases the company was eventually fined  million by the california public utilities commission for failing to adequately implement energy efficiency programs since darbee took control of the pge company in  pge has aggressively promoted its environmental image through a variety of programs and campaignscitation needed in the early first decade of the st century the ceo of pge corporation peter darbee and thenceo of pacific gas  electric

efficient commercially available—at their compressor station plants in their cooling towers along the natural gas transmission pipelines pge did not inform the local water board of the contamination until december   stalling action on a response to the contamination the residents of hinkley filed a successful lawsuit against pge in which the company paid  million— the largest settlement ever paid in a directaction lawsuit in us history the legal case which was dramatized in the  film erin brockovich became an international cause célèbre in response in  at the request of the calepa the chromate toxicity review committee was formed to investigate the toxicity of chromium when ingested in  a senate hearing revealed that the committees supposedlyclarification needed blueribbon members included pge defense expert witnesses who had influenced the final august  report which found in pges favor concluding that other reports were alarmist with spuriously high statistics and that further evaluation should be handled by academics in laboratory settings not by regulators through time the report was recanted but it set back regulation of chromium  for many yearscitation needed in july  california became the first state to acknowledge that ingested chromium is linked to cancer and as a result has established a maximum chromium contaminant level mcl of  parts per billion ppb in setting the regulations it was acknowledged that in recent scientific studies in laboratory animals hexavalent chromium has also been linked to cancer when ingested previously when older chromium mcls were set at the time total chromium mcls were established ingested hexavalent chromium associated with consumption of drinking water was not considered to pose a cancer risk as is now the case by  pge

contamination of the area with owners unable to see their properties epidemiologist john morgan produced a  report for the california cancer registry in which he argued that there was no cancer cluster in hinkley related to chromium  in one study morgan had claimed that cancer rates in hinkley remained unremarkable from  to  saying that the  cases of cancer reported during the most recent survey of  through  were less than what he would expect based on demographics and the regional rate of cancer in  the center for public integrity found glaring weaknesses in morgans  analysis that challenged the validity of his findings in his first study he dismisses what others see as a genuine cancer cluster in hinkley in his latest analysis he excludes people who were exposed to the worst contamination sierra blazeedit on june   a nevada county jury in nevada city found pge guilty of a pattern of treetrimming violations that sparked a devastating  wildfire in the sierra pge was

naturalgas pipelines that was at least  years old  inches  centimeters in diameter and located under a street intersection in a residential area exploded sending a foot section of pipe weighing  pounds flying through the air fueled by blowing natural gas the blast created a crater at the epicenter and killed eight people and injured nearly five dozen more while destroying about  homes the usgs reported that the shock wave was similar to a  magnitude earthquake following the event the company was heavily criticized for ignoring the warnings of a state inspector in  and for failing to provide adequate safety procedures the incident then came under investigation by the national transportation safety board ntsb on august   the ntsb released its findings which placed fault for the blast on pge the report stated that the pipeline installed in  that later burst did not even meet standards of that time pge was charged with twelve criminal felony counts alleging violations of the natural gas pipeline safety act pge pleaded not guilty to the criminal counts in both the initial and superseding indictments opting to put the prosecutors to their proof on april   a united states grand jury in san francisco charged pge with knowingly and willfully violating the natural gas pipeline safety act in august  the california public utilities commission levied a  million fine against

meters complaints of pges failing to honor customers refusal of upgrading their meters also surfaced although the contractor that installed the meters would honor these requests pge would eventually come out and replace them despite objections subsequently the california public utilities commission would conduct an investigation and find that of the  smart meter field tests  meters were successfully tested and  passed average registration accuracy one meter was found to have serious errors and was malfunctioning on arrival while another was found to have serious event errors upon installation these meters were therefore excluded from testing proposition edit in  pge was accused of attempting to stifle competition with proposition  which mandated approval from twothirds of voters to start or expand a local utility critics argued that this would make it harder for local governments to create their own power utilities thus effectively giving pge a monopoly the company was

lighting gasworks were built in the larger eastern american cities but there was no gas industry in the west however in san francisco street lighting was available only on merchant street in the form of oil lamps three brothers—peter james and michael donahue—became interested in gas manufacturing while running the foundry that later became union iron works the largest shipbuilding operation on the west coast joseph g eastland an engineer and clerk at the foundry joined them in gathering as much information on gas making as they could find in july  james applied for and received from the common council of the city of san francisco a franchise to erect a gasworks lay pipes in the streets and install street lamps to light the city with brilliant gas the council specified that gas should be supplied to households at such rates as will make it to their interest to use it in preference to any other material– the donahue brothers and eastland incorporated the san francisco gas company on august   with  of authorized capital the company became the first gas utility in the west its official seal bore the inscription fiat lux—let there be light—the same slogan later adopted by the university of california there were  original stockholders and the three donahue brothers subscribed for  of the  shares the original location for the gas works was bounded by first fremont howard and natoma streets south of market on the then shore of the san francisco bay work on the plant started in november  and it was ready for operation only a few months later on the night of february   the streets of san francisco were for the first time lighted by gas to celebrate the event the company held a gala banquet at the oriental hotel gas lighting quickly gained public favor in the first year of operation there were  customers that number more than doubled the next year to  by the end of  the company had laid more than  ½ miles of pipe and  street lamps were in operation the growing popularity of gas light led to the establishment of competing gas companies including aubin patent gas company and citizens gas company these smaller companies were quickly acquired by the san francisco gas company however one rival provided serious competition– the city gas company was founded in april  by the bank of california to compete with the gas monopoly held by the donahue brothers operation city gas began operation in  and initiated a price war with the san francisco gas company– in  the companies negotiated their consolidation as a compromise and the bank of california gained part ownership of the most lucrative gas monopoly in the west on april   the san francisco gas light company was formed representing a merger of the san francisco gas company the city gas company and the metropolitan gas company– san francisco gas and electricedit gas utilities including san francisco gas light faced new competition with the introduction of electric lighting to california– according to a  pge publication and their  commissioned history in  san francisco was the first city in the us to have a central generating station for electric customers to stay competitive the san francisco gas light company introduced the argand lamp that same year the lamp increased the light capacity of gas street lamps but proved to be an expensive improvement and was not generally adopted– meanwhile the demand for electric light in the stores and factories of downtown san francisco continued to grow the first electric street light was erected in  in front of city hall and the electrical grid supporting it was gradually extended a second generating station was constructed in  by the california electric light company to increase production capacity– new competition also emerged in the s in the form of water gas an improved illuminant patented by thaddeus lowe the united gas improvement company a water gas manufacturer organized after purchasing the lowe gas patents acquired a lease and then an interest in san franciscos central gas light company on november  – united was acquired by the pacific gas improvement company in  under the management of president albert miller pacific gas improvement developed into a formidable competitor to san francisco gas light– horace a miller secretary and c o g miller christian otto gerberding miller president owned and controlled not only the pacific gas improvement company but also the pacific gas lighting company pacific lighting company cog miller is buried in a pyramid mausoleum at mountain view cemetery oakland ca horace miller built an enormous mansion in piedmont ca at  mountain avenue in  designed by arthur brown famous san francisco architect in  san francisco gas light built its own water gas plant at the potrero gas works the manufacturing of water gas proved successful due to the increased availability of inexpensive petroleum the company decided to construct a modern gas works with both updated water gas manufacturing technology and a modern coalgas plant as a hedge against shortages in the supply of oil in  the north beach gas works was completed under the direction of san francisco gas light president and engineer joseph b crockett the facility was the largest gas holder in the us west of chicago in  the edison light and power company merged with the san francisco gas light company to form the new san francisco gas and electric companyconsolidation of gas and electric companies solved problems for both utilities by eliminating competition and producing economic savings through joint operation– other companies that began operation as active competitors but eventually merged into the san francisco gas and electric company included the equitable gas light company the independent electric light and power company and the independent gas and power company in  the company purchased its main competitor for gas lighting the pacific gas improvement company– pacific gas and electric companyedit pacific gas and electric company plant in sacramento  according to pges  history timeline on their webpage the san francisco gas and electric company and the california gas and electric corporation merged to form the pacific gas and electric company pge on october   the consolidation provided the california gas and electric corporation with access to the large san francisco market and a base for further financing the san francisco gas and electric company in turn was able to reinforce its electric system which until then had been powered entirely by steamoperated generating plants and could not compete with lower cost hydroelectric power– after the merger was formally completed engineers and management from both organizations formulated plans for coordinating and unifying the two gas and electric systems– however the two firms maintained separate corporate identities until – pges natural gas transmission system serving millions of california homes pge began delivering natural gas to san francisco and northern california in  through the longest pipeline in the world connecting the texas gas fields to northern california with compressor stations that included cooling towers every  miles  km at topock arizona on the state line and near the town of hinkley california with the introduction of natural gas the company began retiring its polluting gas manufacturing facilities though it kept some plants on standby today there is a network of eight compressor stations linked by  miles of distribution pipelines and over  miles of transportation pipelines serving  million customers from bakersfield to the oregon border in the s and s at both topock and hinkley compressor stations hexavalent chromium in the form of an additive was used in rustprevention in the cooling towers that prepared the gas for transportation through pge’s pipeline to northern and central california these cooling waters were then disposed of adjacent to the compressor stations in  charles m coleman—who worked for pges publicity department—completed his book entitled p g and e of california the centennial story of pacific gas and electric company – the  san francisco earthquakeedit pge was significantly affected by the  san francisco earthquake the companys assorted central offices were damaged by the quake and destroyed by the subsequent fire its san francisco gas and electric company subsidiary in particular suffered significant infrastructure loss as its distribution systems—miles of gas mains and electric wires—were dissevered only two gas and two electric plants all located far from the city survived the destruction– these functioning facilities—including the new foot crude oil gas works at potrero point—played critical roles in san franciscos rebuilding efforts many of pges utility competitors ceased operation following the great earthquake however the companys substantial capital allowed it to survive rebuild and expand sacramento electric gas and railway companyedit in  pge purchased the sacramento electric gas and railway company and took control of its railway operations in and around sacramento the sacramento city street railway began operating under the pacific gas  electric name in  and its track and services subsequently expanded by  the sacramento street railway division operated  streetcars on  miles  km of track pges streetcars were powered by the companys hydroelectric plant in folsom in  pge sold the rail service to pacific city lines which was later acquired by national city lines several streetcar lines were soon converted to bus service and the track was abandoned entirely in  during this same period pacific city lines and its successor national city lines with funding from general motors firestone tire standard oil of california through a subsidiary federal engineering phillips petroleum and mack trucks were buying streetcar lines and rapidly converting most of them to bus service this consortium was convicted in  of federal charges involving conspiracy to monopolize interstate commerce in the sale of buses and supplies to national city lines and its subsidiaries the actions became known as the great american streetcar scandal or the general motors streetcar conspiracy further consolidation and expansionedit pge general office building in san francisco within a few years of its incorporation pge made significant inroads into northern californias hydroelectric industry through purchase of existing water storage and conveyance facilities these included many reservoirs dams ditches and flumes built by mining interests in the sierras that were no longer commercially viable by  pge was the largest integrated utility system on the pacific coast the company handled  percent of the electric and gas business in california its operations spanned  square miles across  counties the company expanded in the s through strategic consolidation important acquisitions during this period included the california telephone and light company the western states gas and electric company and the sierra and san francisco power company which provided hydropower to san franciscos streetcars– these three companies added valuable properties and power and water sources by the end of  pge had nearly one million customers and provided electricity to  northern californian communities– in  pge purchased majority stock holdings in two major californian utility systems—great western power and san joaquin light and power—from the north american company a new york investment firm in return north american received shares of pges common stock worth  million pge also gained control of two smaller utilities midland counties public service and the fresno water company which was later sold the acquisition of these utilities did not result in an immediate merger of property and personnel the great western power company and the san joaquin company remained separate corporate entities for several more years but through this final major consolidation pge soon served nearly all of northern and central california through one integrated system– natural gasedit the gas industry market structure was dramatically altered by the discovery of massive natural gas fields throughout the american southwest beginning in  the fuel was cleaner than manufactured gas and less expensive to produce while natural gas sources were abundant in southern california no economical sources were available in northern california in  pge constructed a mile pipeline from the kettleman oil field to bring natural gas to san francisco the city became the first major urban area to switch from manufactured gas to natural gas the transition required the adjustment of burners and airflow valves on  million appliances in  pge expanded distribution with an additional mile pipeline from milpitas pge gradually retired its gas manufacturing facilities although some plants were kept on standby defense activities boosted natural gas sales in california during world war ii but cut deeply into the states natural reserves– in  pge entered into a contract with the southern california gas company and the southern counties gas company to purchase natural gas through a new mile pipeline running from texas and new mexico to los angeles– another agreement was reached with the el paso natural gas company of texas for gas delivery to the californiaarizona border in  pge completed a mile main that connected with the el paso network at the state line– during this period of expansion pge was involved in legal proceedings with the securities and exchange commission regarding the companys status as a subsidiary of the north american company as outlined by the public utility holding company act of  a utility subsidiary was defined as a utility company with more than  of their stock held by a public utility holding company though  of pge stock was held by the north american company at this time pge filed with the sec to be exempted from subsidiary status on the grounds that  ownership did not give the north american company control and because the north american company occupied only two board member spots– the north american company backed pges request by stating that they were involved in business operations in a limited capacity the request remained unresolved until  when the north american company sold off stocks that brought its ownership to below  the sec then ruled that pge was not a subsidiary of the north american company in  the north american company sold its remaining stock in pge– nuclear plants and gas pipelinesedit in  the company brought vallecitos nuclear center the first privately owned and operated nuclear reactor in the united states online in pleasanton california the reactor initially produced  kilowatts of power enough to power a town of  in addition to nuclear power pge continued to develop natural gas supplies as well in  the company began working to obtain approval for the import of a large quantity of natural gas from alberta canada to california via a pipeline constructed by westcoast transmission co and the alberta and southern gas company on the canadian side and by pacific gas transmission company a subsidiary of pge on the us side construction of the pipeline lasted  months testing began in  and the completed mile pipeline was dedicated in early  pge began construction on another nuclear facility the diablo canyon power plant in  originally slated to come online in  the plants opening was delayed for several years due to environmental protests and concerns over the safety of the plant’s construction testing of the plant began in  and energy production was brought up to full power in  during the construction of the diablo canyon plant pge continued its efforts to bring natural gas supplies from the north to their service area in california in  the company began exploring possibilities for a mile pipeline from alaska which would travel through the mackenzie river valley and on to join with the previously constructed pipeline originating in alberta in  the mackenzie valley pipeline project received approval from the us federal power commission and support from the carter administration the pipeline still required approval from canada however plans for the pipeline were placed on hold in  by a canadian judge justice thomas r berger of british columbia shelved the project for at least  years citing concerns from first nations groups whose land the pipeline would have traversed as well as potential environmental impacts in  the greatgrandson of pges founder george h roe—david roe published his book entitled dynamos and virgins during the time when there was a growing antinuclearpower movement david roe who was an environmentalist and the environmental defense funds west coast general counsel mounted an assault on the longstanding assumption that steady growth in coal and nucleargenerating capacity was the only solution to the nations energy needs he based his arguments on an economic analysis aimed at showing that a shift to energy conservation and alternative energy sources alone could slake the thirst for electricity postwar eraedit as of december  pge operated  electric generating units and  generating stations  miles  km of transmission lines and  miles  km of distribution system in  pge reorganized as a holding company pge corporation it consisted of two subsidiaries—pge the regulated utility and a nonregulated energy business in the later s under electricity market deregulation this utility sold off most of its natural gas power plants the utility retained all of its hydroelectric plants the diablo canyon power plant and a few natural gas plants but the large natural gas plants it sold made up a large portion of its generating capacity this had the effect of requiring the utility to buy power from the energy generators at fluctuating prices while being forced to sell the power to consumers at a fixed cost however the market for electricity was dominated by the enron corporation which with help from other corporations artificially pushed prices for electricity ever higher this led to the california electricity crisis that began in  on path  a transmission corridor pge built with a critical power shortage rolling blackouts began on january   bankruptcyedit main article california electricity crisis in  a change in the regulation of californias public utilities including pge began the california public utility commission cpuc set the rates that pge could charge customers and required them to provide as much power as the customers wanted at rates set by the cpuc in the summer of  a drought in the northwest states and in california reduced the amount of hydroelectric power available usually pge could buy cheap hydroelectric power under long term contracts with the bonneville dam etc drought and delays in approval of new power plants and market manipulation decreased available electric power generation capacity that could be generated in state or bought under long term contracts out of state hot weather brought on higher usage rolling blackouts etc with little excess generating capacity of its own pge was forced to buy electricity out of state from suppliers without long term contracts because pge had to buy additional electricity to meet demand some suppliers took advantage of this requirement and manipulated the market by creating artificial shortages and charged very high electrical rates the cpuc refused to adjust the allowable electric rates unable to change rates and sell electricity to consumers for what it cost them on the open market pge started hemorrhaging cash pge company the utility not the holding company entered bankruptcy under chapter  on april   the state of california tried to bail out the utility and provide power to pges  million customers under the same rules that required the state to buy electricity at market rate high cost to meet demand and sell it at lower fixed price and as a result the state also lost significant amounts of money the crisis cost pge and the state somewhere between  and  billion there is some evidence that this crisis played an important part in the eventual recall of california governor gray

 the california state legislature amended the warrenalquist act which created and gives legal authority to the california energy commission to effectively prohibit the construction of new nuclear power plants the environmental defense fund edf filed as an intervenor in pges  general rate case grc claiming that the companys requests for rate increases were based on unrealistically high projections of load growth furthermore edf claimed that pge could more costeffectively encourage industrial cogeneration and energy efficiency than build more power plants as a result of edfs

san francisco gasedit in the s manufactured gas was introduced in the united states as a means of lighting gasworks were built in the larger eastern american cities but there was no gas industry in the west however in san francisco street lighting was available only on merchant street in the form of oil lamps three brothers—peter james and michael donahue—became interested in gas manufacturing while running the foundry that later became union iron works the largest shipbuilding operation on the west coast joseph g eastland an engineer and clerk at the foundry joined them in gathering as much information on gas making as they could find in july  james applied for and received from the common council of the city of san francisco a franchise to erect a gasworks lay pipes in the streets and install street lamps to light the city with brilliant gas the council specified that gas should be supplied to households at such rates as will make it to their interest to use it in preference to any other material– the donahue brothers and eastland incorporated the san francisco gas company on august   with  of authorized capital the company became the first gas utility in the west its official seal bore the inscription fiat lux—let there be light—the same slogan later adopted by the university of california there were  original stockholders and the three donahue brothers subscribed for  of the  shares the original location for the gas works was bounded by first fremont howard and natoma streets south of market on the then shore of the san francisco bay work on the plant started in november  and it was ready for operation only a few months later on the night of february   the streets of san francisco were for the first time lighted by gas to celebrate the event the company held a gala banquet at the oriental hotel gas lighting quickly gained public favor in the first year of operation there were  customers that number more than doubled the next year to  by the end of  the company had laid more than  ½ miles of pipe and  street lamps were in operation the growing popularity of gas light led to the establishment of competing gas companies including aubin patent gas company and citizens gas company these smaller companies were quickly acquired by the san francisco gas company however one rival provided serious competition– the city gas company was founded in april  by the bank of california to compete with the gas monopoly held by the donahue brothers operation city gas began operation in  and initiated a price war with the san francisco gas company– in  the companies negotiated their consolidation as a compromise and the bank of california gained part ownership of the most lucrative gas monopoly in the west on april   the san francisco gas light company was formed representing a merger of the san francisco gas company the city gas company and the metropolitan gas company– san francisco gas and electricedit gas utilities including san francisco gas light faced new competition with the introduction of electric lighting to california– according to a  pge publication and their  commissioned history in  san francisco was the first city in the us to have a central generating station for electric customers to stay competitive the san francisco gas light company introduced the argand lamp that same year the lamp increased the light capacity of gas street lamps but proved to be an expensive improvement and was not generally adopted– meanwhile the demand for electric light in the stores and factories of downtown san francisco continued to grow the first electric street light was erected in  in front of city hall and the electrical grid supporting it was gradually extended a second generating station was constructed in  by the california electric light company to increase production capacity– new competition also emerged in the s in the form of water gas an improved illuminant patented by thaddeus lowe the united gas improvement company a water gas manufacturer organized after purchasing the lowe gas patents acquired a lease and then an interest in san franciscos central gas light company on november  – united was acquired by the pacific gas improvement company in  under the management of president albert miller pacific gas improvement developed into a formidable competitor to san francisco gas light– horace a miller secretary and c o g miller christian otto gerberding miller president owned and controlled not only the pacific gas improvement company but also the pacific gas lighting company pacific lighting company cog miller is buried in a pyramid mausoleum at mountain view cemetery oakland ca horace miller built an enormous mansion in piedmont ca at  mountain avenue in  designed by arthur brown famous san francisco architect in  san francisco gas light built its own water gas plant at the potrero gas works the manufacturing of water gas proved successful due to the increased availability of inexpensive petroleum the company decided to construct a modern gas works with both updated water gas manufacturing technology and a modern coalgas plant as a hedge against shortages in the supply of oil in  the north beach gas works was completed under the direction of san francisco gas light president and engineer joseph b crockett the facility was the largest gas holder in the us west of chicago in  the edison light and power company merged with the san francisco gas light company to form the new san francisco gas and electric companyconsolidation of gas and electric companies solved problems for both utilities by eliminating competition and producing economic savings through joint operation– other companies that began operation as active competitors but eventually merged into the san francisco gas and electric company included the equitable gas light company the independent electric light and power company and the independent gas and power company in  the company purchased its main competitor for gas lighting the pacific gas improvement company– pacific gas and electric companyedit pacific gas and electric company plant in sacramento  according to pges  history timeline on their webpage the san francisco gas and electric company and the california gas and electric corporation merged to form the pacific gas and electric company pge on october   the consolidation provided the california gas and electric corporation with access to the large san francisco market and a base for further financing the san francisco gas and electric company in turn was able to reinforce its electric system which until then had been powered entirely by steamoperated generating plants and could not compete with lower cost hydroelectric power– after the merger was formally completed engineers and management from both organizations formulated plans for coordinating and unifying the two gas and electric systems– however the two firms maintained separate corporate identities until – pges natural gas transmission system serving millions of california homes pge began delivering natural gas to san francisco and northern california in  through the longest pipeline in the world connecting the texas gas fields to northern california with compressor stations that included cooling towers every  miles  km at topock arizona on the state line and near the town of hinkley california with the introduction of natural gas the company began retiring its polluting gas manufacturing facilities though it kept some plants on standby today there is a network of eight compressor stations linked by  miles of distribution pipelines and over  miles of transportation pipelines serving  million customers from bakersfield to the oregon border in the s and s at both topock and hinkley compressor stations hexavalent chromium in the form of an additive was used in rustprevention in the cooling towers that prepared the gas for transportation through pge’s pipeline to northern and central california these cooling waters were then disposed of adjacent to the compressor stations in  charles m coleman—who worked for pges publicity department—completed his book entitled p g and e of california the centennial story of pacific gas and electric company – the  san francisco earthquakeedit pge was significantly affected by the  san francisco earthquake the companys assorted central offices were damaged by the quake and destroyed by the subsequent fire its san francisco gas and electric company subsidiary in particular suffered significant infrastructure loss as its distribution systems—miles of gas mains and electric wires—were dissevered only two gas and two electric plants all located far from the city survived the destruction– these functioning facilities—including the new foot crude oil gas works at potrero point—played critical roles in san franciscos rebuilding efforts many of pges utility competitors ceased operation following the great earthquake however the companys substantial capital allowed it to survive rebuild and expand sacramento electric gas and railway companyedit in  pge purchased the sacramento electric gas and railway company and took control of its railway operations in and around sacramento the sacramento city street railway began operating under the pacific gas  electric name in  and its track and services subsequently expanded by  the sacramento street railway division operated  streetcars on  miles  km of track pges streetcars were powered by the companys hydroelectric plant in folsom in  pge sold the rail service to pacific city lines which was later acquired by national city lines several streetcar lines were soon converted to bus service and the track was abandoned entirely in  during this same period pacific city lines and its successor national city lines with funding from general motors firestone tire standard oil of california through a subsidiary federal engineering phillips petroleum and mack trucks were buying streetcar lines and rapidly converting most of them to bus service this consortium was convicted in  of federal charges involving conspiracy to monopolize interstate commerce in the sale of buses and supplies to national city lines and its subsidiaries the actions became known as the great american streetcar scandal or the general motors streetcar conspiracy further consolidation and expansionedit pge general office building in san francisco within a few years of its incorporation pge made significant inroads into northern californias hydroelectric industry through purchase of existing water storage and conveyance facilities these included many reservoirs dams ditches and flumes built by mining interests in the sierras that were no longer commercially viable by  pge was the largest integrated utility system on the pacific coast the company handled  percent of the electric and gas business in california its operations spanned  square miles across  counties the company expanded in the s through strategic consolidation important acquisitions during this period included the california telephone and light company the western states gas and electric company and the sierra and san francisco power company which provided hydropower to san franciscos streetcars– these three companies added valuable properties and power and water sources by the end of  pge had nearly one million customers and provided electricity to  northern californian communities– in  pge purchased majority stock holdings in two major californian utility systems—great western power and san joaquin light and power—from the north american company a new york investment firm in return north american received shares of pges common stock worth  million pge also gained control of two smaller utilities midland counties public service and the fresno water company which was later sold the acquisition of these utilities did not result in an immediate merger of property and personnel the great western power company and the san joaquin company remained separate corporate entities for several more years but through this final major consolidation pge soon served nearly all of northern and central california through one integrated system– natural gasedit the gas industry market structure was dramatically altered by the discovery of massive natural gas fields throughout the american southwest beginning in  the fuel was cleaner than manufactured gas and less expensive to produce while natural gas sources were abundant in southern california no economical sources were available in northern california in  pge constructed a mile pipeline from the kettleman oil field to bring natural gas to san francisco the city became the first major urban area to switch from manufactured gas to natural gas the transition required the adjustment of burners and airflow valves on  million appliances in  pge expanded distribution with an additional mile pipeline from milpitas pge gradually retired its gas manufacturing facilities although some plants were kept on standby defense activities boosted natural gas sales in california during world war ii but cut deeply into the states natural reserves– in  pge entered into a contract with the southern california gas company and the southern counties gas company to purchase natural gas through a new mile pipeline running from texas and new mexico to los angeles– another agreement was reached with the el paso natural gas company of texas for gas delivery to the californiaarizona border in  pge completed a mile main that connected with the el paso network at the state line– during this period of expansion pge was involved in legal proceedings with the securities and exchange commission regarding the companys status as a subsidiary of the north american company as outlined by the public utility holding company act of  a utility subsidiary was defined as a utility company with more than  of their stock held by a public utility holding company though  of pge stock was held by the north american company at this time pge filed with the sec to be exempted from subsidiary status on the grounds that  ownership did not give the north american company control and because the north american company occupied only two board member spots– the north american company backed pges request by stating that they were involved in business operations in a limited capacity the request remained unresolved until  when the north american company sold off stocks that brought its ownership to below  the sec then ruled that pge was not a subsidiary of the north american company in  the north american company sold its remaining stock in pge– nuclear plants and gas pipelinesedit in  the company brought vallecitos nuclear center the first privately owned and operated nuclear reactor in the united states online in pleasanton california the reactor initially produced  kilowatts of power enough to power a town of  in addition to nuclear power pge continued to develop natural gas supplies as well in  the company began working to obtain approval for the import of a large quantity of natural gas from alberta canada to california via a pipeline constructed by westcoast transmission co and the alberta and southern gas company on the canadian side and by pacific gas transmission company a subsidiary of pge on the us side construction of the pipeline lasted  months testing began in  and the completed mile pipeline was dedicated in early  pge began construction on another nuclear facility the diablo canyon power plant in  originally slated to come online in  the plants opening was delayed for several years due to environmental protests and concerns over the safety of the plant’s construction testing of the plant began in  and energy production was brought up to full power in  during the construction of the diablo canyon plant pge continued its efforts to bring natural gas supplies from the north to their service area in california in  the company began exploring possibilities for a mile pipeline from alaska which would travel through the mackenzie river valley and on to join with the previously constructed pipeline originating in alberta in  the mackenzie valley pipeline project received approval from the us federal power commission and support from the carter administration the pipeline still required approval from canada however plans for the pipeline were placed on hold in  by a canadian judge justice thomas r berger of british columbia shelved the project for at least  years citing concerns from first nations groups whose land the pipeline would have traversed as well as potential environmental impacts in  the greatgrandson of pges founder george h roe—david roe published his book entitled dynamos and virgins during the time when there was a growing antinuclearpower movement david roe who was an environmentalist and the environmental defense funds west coast general counsel mounted an assault on the longstanding assumption that steady growth in coal and nucleargenerating capacity was the only solution to the nations energy needs he based his arguments on an economic analysis aimed at showing that a shift to energy conservation and alternative energy sources alone could slake the thirst for electricity postwar eraedit as of december  pge operated  electric generating units and  generating stations  miles  km of transmission lines and  miles  km of distribution system in  pge reorganized as a holding company pge corporation it consisted of two subsidiaries—pge the regulated utility and a nonregulated energy business in the later s under electricity market deregulation this utility sold off most of its natural gas power plants the utility retained all of its hydroelectric plants the diablo canyon power plant and a few natural gas plants but the large natural gas plants it sold made up a large portion of its generating capacity this had the effect of requiring the utility to buy power from the energy generators at fluctuating prices while being forced to sell the power to consumers at a fixed cost however the market for electricity was dominated by the enron corporation which with help from other corporations artificially pushed prices for electricity ever higher this led to the california electricity crisis that began in  on path  a transmission corridor pge built with a critical power shortage rolling blackouts began on january   bankruptcyedit main article california electricity crisis in  a change in the regulation of californias public utilities including pge began the california public utility commission cpuc set the rates that pge could charge customers and required them to provide as much power as the customers wanted at rates set by the cpuc in the summer of  a drought in the northwest states and in california reduced the amount of hydroelectric power available usually pge could buy cheap hydroelectric power under long term contracts with the bonneville dam etc drought and delays in approval of new power plants and market manipulation decreased available electric power generation capacity that could be generated in state or bought under long term contracts out of state hot weather brought on higher usage rolling blackouts etc with little excess generating capacity of its own pge was forced to buy electricity out of state from suppliers without long term contracts because pge had to buy additional electricity to meet demand some suppliers took advantage of this requirement and manipulated the market by creating artificial shortages and charged very high electrical rates the cpuc refused to adjust the allowable electric rates unable to change rates and sell electricity to consumers for what it cost them on the open market pge started hemorrhaging cash pge company the utility not the holding company entered bankruptcy under chapter  on april   the state of california tried to bail out the utility and provide power to pges  million customers under the same rules that required the state to buy electricity at market rate high cost to meet demand and sell it at lower fixed price and as a result the state also lost significant amounts of money the crisis cost pge and the state somewhere between  and  billion there is some evidence that this crisis played an important part in the eventual recall of california governor gray davis pge company the utility emerged from bankruptcy in april  after paying  billion to its hundreds of creditors as part of the reorganization pges  million electricity customers will have to pay abovemarket prices for several years to cancel the debt generation portfolioedit pges

intervenor in pges  general rate case grc claiming that the companys requests for rate increases were based on unrealistically high projections of load growth furthermore edf claimed that pge could more costeffectively encourage industrial cogeneration and energy efficiency than build more power plants as a result of edfs involvement in pges rate cases the company was eventually fined  million

efficient commercially available—at their compressor station plants in their cooling towers along the natural gas transmission pipelines pge did not inform the local water board of the contamination until december   stalling action on a response to the contamination the residents of hinkley filed a successful lawsuit against pge in which the company paid  million— the largest settlement ever paid in a directaction lawsuit in us history the legal case which was dramatized in the  film erin brockovich became an international cause célèbre in response in  at the request of the calepa the chromate toxicity review committee was formed to investigate the toxicity of chromium when ingested in  a senate hearing revealed that the committees supposedlyclarification needed blueribbon members included pge defense expert witnesses who had influenced the final august  report which found in pges favor concluding that other reports were alarmist with spuriously high statistics and that further evaluation should be handled by academics in laboratory settings not by regulators through time the report was recanted but it set back regulation of chromium  for many yearscitation needed in july  california became the first state to acknowledge that ingested chromium is linked to cancer and as a result has established a maximum chromium contaminant level mcl of  parts per billion ppb in setting the regulations it was acknowledged that in recent scientific studies in laboratory animals hexavalent chromium has also been linked to cancer when ingested previously when older chromium mcls were set at the time total chromium mcls were established ingested hexavalent chromium associated with consumption of drinking water was not considered to pose a cancer risk as is now the case by  pge

contamination of the area with owners unable to see their properties epidemiologist john morgan produced a  report for the california cancer registry in which he argued that there was no cancer cluster in hinkley related to chromium  in one study morgan had claimed that cancer rates in hinkley remained unremarkable from  to  saying that the  cases of cancer reported during the most recent survey of  through  were less than what he would expect based on demographics and the regional rate of cancer in  the center for public integrity found glaring weaknesses in morgans  analysis that challenged the validity of his findings in his first study he dismisses what others see as a genuine cancer cluster in hinkley in his latest analysis he excludes people who were exposed to the worst

san francisco gasedit in the s manufactured gas was introduced in the united states as a means of lighting gasworks were built in the larger eastern american cities but there was no gas industry in the west however in san francisco street lighting was available only on merchant street in the form of oil lamps three brothers—peter james and michael donahue—became interested in gas manufacturing while running the foundry that later became union iron works the largest shipbuilding operation on the west coast joseph g eastland an engineer and clerk at the foundry joined them in gathering as much information on gas making as they could find in july  james applied for and received from the common council of the city of san francisco a franchise to erect a gasworks lay pipes in the streets and install street lamps to light the city with brilliant gas the council specified that gas should be supplied to households at such rates as will make it to their interest to use it in preference to any other material– the donahue brothers and eastland incorporated the san francisco gas company on august   with  of authorized capital the company became the first gas utility in the west its official seal bore the inscription fiat lux—let there be light—the same slogan later adopted by the university of california there were  original stockholders and the three donahue brothers subscribed for  of the  shares the original location for the gas works was bounded by first fremont howard and natoma streets south of market on the then shore of the san francisco bay work on the plant started in november  and it was ready for operation only a few months later on the night of february   the streets of san francisco were for the first time lighted by gas to celebrate the event the company held a gala banquet at the oriental hotel gas lighting quickly gained public favor in the first year of operation there were  customers that number more than doubled the next year to  by the end of  the company had laid more than  ½ miles of pipe and  street lamps were in operation the growing popularity of gas light led to the establishment of competing gas companies including aubin patent gas company and citizens gas company these smaller companies were quickly acquired by the san francisco gas company however one rival provided serious competition– the city gas company was founded in april  by the bank of california to compete with the gas monopoly held by the donahue brothers operation city gas began operation in  and initiated a price war with the san francisco gas company– in  the companies negotiated their consolidation as a compromise and the bank of california gained part ownership of the most lucrative gas monopoly in the west on april   the san francisco gas light company was formed representing a merger of the san francisco gas company the city gas company and the metropolitan gas company– san francisco gas and electricedit gas utilities including san francisco gas light faced new competition with the introduction of electric lighting to california– according to a  pge publication and their  commissioned history in  san francisco was the first city in the us to have a central generating station for electric customers to stay competitive the san francisco gas light company introduced the argand lamp that same year the lamp increased the light capacity of gas street lamps but proved to be an expensive improvement and was not generally adopted– meanwhile the demand for electric light in the stores and factories of downtown san francisco continued to grow the first electric street light was erected in  in front of city hall and the electrical grid supporting it was gradually extended a second generating station was constructed in  by the california electric light company to increase production capacity– new competition also emerged in the s in the form of water gas an improved illuminant patented by thaddeus lowe the united gas improvement company a water gas manufacturer organized after purchasing the lowe gas patents acquired a lease and then an interest in san franciscos central gas light company on november  – united was acquired by the pacific gas improvement company in  under the management of president albert miller pacific gas improvement developed into a formidable competitor to san francisco gas light– horace a miller secretary and c o g miller christian otto gerberding miller president owned and controlled not only the pacific gas improvement company but also the pacific gas lighting company pacific lighting company cog miller is buried in a pyramid mausoleum at mountain view cemetery oakland ca horace miller built an enormous mansion in piedmont ca at  mountain avenue in  designed by arthur brown famous san francisco architect in  san francisco gas light built its own water gas plant at the potrero gas works the manufacturing of water gas proved successful due to the increased availability of inexpensive petroleum the company decided to construct a modern gas works with both updated water gas manufacturing technology and a modern coalgas plant as a hedge against shortages in the supply of oil in  the north beach gas works was completed under the direction of san francisco gas light president and engineer joseph b crockett the facility was the largest gas holder in the us west of chicago in  the edison light and power company merged with the san francisco gas light company to form the new san francisco gas and electric companyconsolidation of gas and electric companies solved problems for both utilities by eliminating competition and producing economic savings through joint operation– other companies that began operation as active competitors but eventually merged into the san francisco gas and electric company included the equitable gas light company the independent electric light and power company and the independent gas and power company in  the company purchased its main competitor for gas lighting the pacific gas improvement company– pacific gas and electric companyedit pacific gas and electric company plant in sacramento  according to pges  history timeline on their webpage the san francisco gas and electric company and the california gas and electric corporation merged to form the pacific gas and electric company pge on october   the consolidation provided the california gas and electric corporation with access to the large san francisco market and a base for further financing the san francisco gas and electric company in turn was able to reinforce its electric system which until then had been powered entirely by steamoperated generating plants and could not compete with lower cost hydroelectric power– after the merger was formally completed engineers and management from both organizations formulated plans for coordinating and unifying the two gas and electric systems– however the two firms maintained separate corporate identities until – pges natural gas transmission system serving millions of california homes pge began delivering natural gas to san francisco and northern california in  through the longest pipeline in the world connecting the texas gas fields to northern california with compressor stations that included cooling towers every  miles  km at topock arizona on the state line and near the town of hinkley california with the introduction of natural gas the company began retiring its polluting gas manufacturing facilities though it kept some plants on standby today there is a network of eight compressor stations linked by  miles of distribution pipelines and over  miles of transportation pipelines serving  million customers from bakersfield to the oregon border in the s and s at both topock and hinkley compressor stations hexavalent chromium in the form of an additive was used in rustprevention in the cooling towers that prepared the gas for transportation through pge’s pipeline to northern and central california these cooling waters were then disposed of adjacent to the compressor stations in  charles m coleman—who worked for pges publicity department—completed his book entitled p g and e of california the centennial story of pacific gas and electric company – the  san francisco earthquakeedit pge was significantly affected by the  san francisco earthquake the companys assorted central offices were damaged by the quake and destroyed by the subsequent fire its san francisco gas and electric company subsidiary in particular suffered significant infrastructure loss as its distribution systems—miles of gas mains and electric wires—were dissevered only two gas and two electric plants all located far from the city survived the destruction– these functioning facilities—including the new foot crude oil gas works at potrero point—played critical roles in san franciscos rebuilding efforts many of pges utility competitors ceased operation following the great earthquake however the companys substantial capital allowed it to survive rebuild and expand sacramento electric gas and railway companyedit in  pge purchased the sacramento electric gas and railway company and took control of its railway operations in and around sacramento the sacramento city street railway began operating under the pacific gas  electric name in  and its track and services subsequently expanded by  the sacramento street railway division operated  streetcars on  miles  km of track pges streetcars were powered by the companys hydroelectric plant in folsom in  pge sold the rail service to pacific city lines which was later acquired by national city lines several streetcar lines were soon converted to bus service and the track was abandoned entirely in  during this same period pacific city lines and its successor national city lines with funding from general motors firestone tire standard oil of california through a subsidiary federal engineering phillips petroleum and mack trucks were buying streetcar lines and rapidly converting most of them to bus service this consortium was convicted in  of federal charges involving conspiracy to monopolize interstate commerce in the sale of buses and supplies to national city lines and its subsidiaries the actions became known as the great american streetcar scandal or the general motors streetcar conspiracy further consolidation and expansionedit pge general office building in san francisco within a few years of its incorporation pge made significant inroads into northern californias hydroelectric industry through purchase of existing water storage and conveyance facilities these included many reservoirs dams ditches and flumes built by mining interests in the sierras that were no longer commercially viable by  pge was the largest integrated utility system on the pacific coast the company handled  percent of the electric and gas business in california its operations spanned  square miles across  counties the company expanded in the s through strategic consolidation important acquisitions during this period included the california telephone and light company the western states gas and electric company and the sierra and san francisco power company which provided hydropower to san franciscos streetcars– these three companies added valuable properties and power and water sources by the end of  pge had nearly one million customers and provided electricity to  northern californian communities– in  pge purchased majority stock holdings in two major californian utility systems—great western power and san joaquin light and power—from the north american company a new york investment firm in return north american received shares of pges common stock worth  million pge also gained control of two smaller utilities midland counties public service and the fresno water company which was later sold the acquisition of these utilities did not result in an immediate merger of property and personnel the great western power company and the san joaquin company remained separate corporate entities for several more years but through this final major consolidation pge soon served nearly all of northern and central california through one integrated system– natural gasedit the gas industry market structure was dramatically altered by the discovery of massive natural gas fields throughout the american southwest beginning in  the fuel was cleaner than manufactured gas and less expensive to produce while natural gas sources were abundant in southern california no economical sources were available in northern california in  pge constructed a mile pipeline from the kettleman oil field to bring natural gas to san francisco the city became the first major urban area to switch from manufactured gas to natural gas the transition required the adjustment of burners and airflow valves on  million appliances in  pge expanded distribution with an additional mile pipeline from milpitas pge gradually retired its gas manufacturing facilities although some plants were kept on standby defense activities boosted natural gas sales in california during world war ii but cut deeply into the states natural reserves– in  pge entered into a contract with the southern california gas company and the southern counties gas company to purchase natural gas through a new mile pipeline running from texas and new mexico to los angeles– another agreement was reached with the el paso natural gas company of texas for gas delivery to the californiaarizona border in  pge completed a mile main that connected with the el paso network at the state line– during this period of expansion pge was involved in legal proceedings with the securities and exchange commission regarding the companys status as a subsidiary of the north american company as outlined by the public utility holding company act of  a utility subsidiary was defined as a utility company with more than  of their stock held by a public utility holding company though  of pge stock was held by the north american company at this time pge filed with the sec to be exempted from subsidiary status on the grounds that  ownership did not give the north american company control and because the north american company occupied only two board member spots– the north american company backed pges request by stating that they were involved in business operations in a limited capacity the request remained unresolved until  when the north american company sold off stocks that brought its ownership to below  the sec then ruled that pge was not a subsidiary of the north american company in  the north american company sold its remaining stock in pge– nuclear plants and gas pipelinesedit in  the company brought vallecitos nuclear center the first privately owned and operated nuclear reactor in the united states online in pleasanton california the reactor initially produced  kilowatts of power enough to power a town of  in addition to nuclear power pge continued to develop natural gas supplies as well in  the company began working to obtain approval for the import of a large quantity of natural gas from alberta canada to california via a pipeline constructed by westcoast transmission co and the alberta and southern gas company on the canadian side and by pacific gas transmission company a subsidiary of pge on the us side construction of the pipeline lasted  months testing began in  and the completed mile pipeline was dedicated in early  pge began construction on another nuclear facility the diablo canyon power plant in  originally slated to come online in  the plants opening was delayed for several years due to environmental protests and concerns over the safety of the plant’s construction testing of the plant began in  and energy production was brought up to full power in  during the construction of the diablo canyon plant pge continued its efforts to bring natural gas supplies from the north to their service area in california in  the company began exploring possibilities for a mile pipeline from alaska which would travel through the mackenzie river valley and on to join with the previously constructed pipeline originating in alberta in  the mackenzie valley pipeline project received approval from the us federal power commission and support from the carter administration the pipeline still required approval from canada however plans for the pipeline were placed on hold in  by a canadian judge justice thomas r berger of british columbia shelved the project for at least  years citing concerns from first nations groups whose land the pipeline would have traversed as well as potential environmental impacts in  the greatgrandson of pges founder george h roe—david roe published his book entitled dynamos and virgins during the time when there was a growing antinuclearpower movement david roe who was an environmentalist and the environmental defense funds west coast general counsel mounted an assault on the longstanding assumption that steady growth in coal and nucleargenerating capacity was the only solution to the nations energy needs he based his arguments on an economic analysis aimed at showing that a shift to energy conservation and alternative energy sources alone could slake the thirst for electricity postwar eraedit as of december  pge operated  electric generating units and  generating stations  miles  km of transmission lines and  miles  km of distribution system in  pge reorganized as a holding company pge corporation it consisted of two subsidiaries—pge the regulated utility and a nonregulated energy business in the later s under electricity market deregulation this utility sold off most of its natural gas power plants the utility retained all of its hydroelectric plants the diablo canyon power plant and a few natural gas plants but the large natural gas plants it sold made up a large portion of its generating capacity this had the effect of requiring the utility to buy power from the energy generators at fluctuating prices while being forced to sell the power to consumers at a fixed cost however the market for electricity was dominated by the enron corporation which with help from other corporations artificially pushed prices for electricity ever higher this led to the california electricity crisis that began in  on path  a transmission corridor pge built with a critical power shortage rolling blackouts began on january   bankruptcyedit main article california electricity crisis in  a change in the regulation of californias public utilities including pge began the california public utility commission cpuc set the rates that pge could charge customers and required them to provide as much power as the customers wanted at rates set by the cpuc in the summer of  a drought in the northwest states and in california reduced the amount of hydroelectric power available usually pge could buy cheap hydroelectric power under long term contracts with the bonneville dam etc drought and delays in approval of new power plants and market manipulation decreased available electric power generation capacity that could be generated in state or bought under long term contracts out of state hot weather brought on higher usage rolling blackouts etc with little excess generating capacity of its own pge was forced to buy electricity out of state from suppliers without long term contracts because pge had to buy additional electricity to meet demand some suppliers took advantage of this requirement and manipulated the market by creating artificial shortages and charged very high electrical rates the cpuc refused to adjust the allowable electric rates unable to change rates and sell electricity to consumers for what it cost them on the open market pge started hemorrhaging cash pge company the utility not the holding company entered bankruptcy under chapter  on april   the state of california tried to bail out the utility and provide power to pges  million customers under the same rules that required the state to buy electricity at market rate high cost to meet demand and sell it at lower fixed price and as a result the state also lost significant amounts of money the crisis cost pge and the state somewhere between  and  billion there is some evidence that this crisis played an important part in the eventual recall of california governor gray davis pge company the utility emerged from bankruptcy in april  after paying  billion to its hundreds of creditors as part of the reorganization pges  million electricity customers will have to pay abovemarket prices for several years to cancel the debt generation portfolioedit pges

mirant services llc for alleged market manipulations during the  california energy crisis pge took ownership of a partially constructed natural gas unit in antioch california the  mw unit known as the

installations will initially generate enough electricity to power more than  residences in april  pges next blog reported that pge was asking the california public utilities commission to approve a project by the company solaren to deliver  megawatts of power to california from space this method of obtaining electricity from the sun eliminates mostly the darkness of night experienced from solar sites on the surface of the earth according to pge spokesman jonathan marshall energy purchase costs are expected to be similar to other renewable energy contracts pge and the environmentedit beginning in the mids regulatory and political developments began to push utilities in california away from a traditional business model in  the california state legislature amended the warrenalquist act which created and gives legal authority to the california energy commission to effectively prohibit the construction of new nuclear power plants the environmental defense fund edf filed as an intervenor in pges  general rate case grc claiming that the companys requests for rate increases were based on unrealistically high projections of load growth furthermore edf claimed that pge could more costeffectively encourage industrial cogeneration and energy efficiency than build more power plants as a result of edfs involvement in pges rate cases the company was eventually fined  million by the california public utilities commission for failing to adequately implement energy efficiency programs since darbee took control of the pge company in  pge has aggressively promoted its

 pge dumped roughly  million gallons of chromium tainted wastewater into unlined wastewater spreading ponds around the town of hinkley california pge used chromium —one of the cheapest and most efficient commercially available—at their compressor station plants in their cooling towers along the natural gas transmission pipelines pge did not inform the local water board of the contamination until december   stalling action on a response to the contamination the residents of hinkley filed a successful lawsuit against pge in which the company paid  million— the largest settlement ever paid in a directaction lawsuit in us history the legal case which was dramatized in the  film erin brockovich became an international cause célèbre in response in  at the request of the calepa the chromate toxicity review committee was formed to investigate the toxicity of chromium when ingested in  a senate hearing revealed that the committees supposedlyclarification needed blueribbon members included pge defense expert witnesses who had influenced the final august  report which found in pges favor concluding that other reports were alarmist with spuriously high statistics and that further evaluation should be handled by academics in laboratory settings not by regulators through time the report was recanted but it set back regulation of chromium  for many yearscitation needed in july  california became the first state to acknowledge that ingested chromium is linked to cancer and as a result has established a maximum chromium contaminant level mcl of  parts per billion ppb in setting the regulations it was acknowledged that in recent scientific studies in laboratory animals hexavalent chromium has also been linked to cancer when ingested previously when older chromium mcls were set at the time total chromium mcls were established ingested hexavalent chromium associated with consumption of drinking water was not considered to pose a cancer risk as is now the case by  pge

desert area and was asked to stop because of the ongoing danger of residents inhaling chromium  in  the california regional water quality control board lahontan region served pge with a new order to cleanup sic and abate the effects of the discharge of chromium waste or threatened pollution or nuisance by the time of the report the plume had expanded to  miles in length and approximately  miles in width throughout the hinkley valley and into harper dry lake valley polluting new areas in early  the new york times described hinkley as having been slowly turned into a ghost town due to the contamination of the area with owners unable to see their properties epidemiologist john morgan produced a  report for the california cancer registry in which he argued that there was no cancer cluster in hinkley related to chromium  in one study morgan had claimed that cancer rates in hinkley remained unremarkable from  to  saying that the  cases of cancer reported during the most recent survey of  through  were less than what he would expect based on demographics and the regional rate of cancer in  the center for public integrity found glaring weaknesses in morgans  analysis that challenged the validity of his findings in his first study he dismisses what others see as a genuine cancer cluster in hinkley in his latest analysis he excludes people who were exposed to the worst contamination sierra blazeedit on june   a nevada county jury in nevada city found pge guilty of a pattern of treetrimming violations that sparked a devastating  wildfire in the sierra pge was

pounds flying through the air fueled by blowing natural gas the blast created a crater at the epicenter and killed eight people and injured nearly five dozen more while destroying about  homes the

provide adequate safety procedures the incident then came under investigation by the national transportation safety board ntsb on august   the ntsb released its findings which placed fault for the blast on pge the report stated that the pipeline installed in  that later burst did not even meet standards of that time pge was charged with twelve criminal felony counts alleging violations of the

were replaced with smart meters reported seeing their energy bills spike up multiplefolds and accused the company of deliberately inflating their bills along with questioning the accuracy of the meters complaints of pges failing to honor customers refusal of upgrading their meters also surfaced although the contractor that installed the meters would honor these requests pge would eventually come out and replace them despite objections subsequently the california public utilities commission would conduct an investigation and find that of the  smart meter field tests  meters were successfully tested and  passed average registration accuracy one meter was found to have serious errors and was malfunctioning on arrival while another was found to have serious event errors upon installation these meters were therefore excluded from testing proposition edit in  pge was accused of attempting to stifle competition with proposition  which mandated approval from twothirds of voters to start or expand a local utility critics argued that this would make it harder for local governments to create their own power utilities thus effectively giving pge a monopoly the company was

will make it to their interest to use it in preference to any other material– the donahue brothers and eastland incorporated the san francisco gas company on august   with  of authorized capital the company became the first gas utility in the west its official seal bore the inscription fiat lux—let there be light—the same slogan later adopted by the university of california there were  original stockholders and the three donahue brothers subscribed for  of the  shares the original location for the gas works was bounded by first fremont howard and natoma streets south of market on the then shore of the san francisco bay work on the plant started in november  and it was ready for operation only a few months later on the night of february   the streets of san francisco were for the first time lighted by gas to celebrate the event the company held a gala banquet at the oriental hotel gas lighting quickly gained public favor in the first year of operation there were  customers that number more than doubled the next year to  by the end of  the company had laid more than  ½ miles of pipe and  street lamps were in operation the growing popularity of gas light led to the establishment of competing gas companies including aubin patent gas company and citizens gas company these smaller companies were quickly acquired by the san francisco gas company however one rival provided serious competition– the city gas company was founded in april  by the bank of california to compete with the gas monopoly held by the donahue brothers operation city gas began operation in  and initiated a price war with the san francisco gas company– in  the companies negotiated their consolidation as a compromise and the bank of california gained part ownership of the most lucrative gas monopoly in the west on april   the san francisco gas light company was formed representing a merger of the san francisco gas company the city gas company and the metropolitan gas company– san francisco gas and electricedit gas utilities including san francisco gas light faced new competition with the introduction of electric lighting to california– according to a  pge publication and their  commissioned history in  san francisco was the first city in the us to have a central generating station for electric customers to stay competitive the san francisco gas light company introduced the argand lamp that same year the lamp increased the light capacity of gas street lamps but proved to be an expensive improvement and was not generally adopted– meanwhile the demand for electric light in the stores and factories of downtown san francisco continued to grow the first electric street light was erected in  in front of city hall and the electrical grid supporting it was gradually extended a second generating station was constructed in  by the california electric light company to increase production capacity– new competition also emerged in the s in the form of water gas an improved illuminant patented by thaddeus lowe the united gas improvement company a water gas manufacturer organized after purchasing the lowe gas patents acquired a lease and then an interest in san franciscos central gas light company on november  – united was acquired by the pacific gas improvement company in  under the management of president albert miller pacific gas improvement developed into a formidable competitor to san francisco gas light– horace a miller secretary and c o g miller christian otto gerberding miller president owned and controlled not only the pacific gas improvement company but also the pacific gas lighting company pacific lighting company cog miller is buried in a pyramid mausoleum at mountain view cemetery oakland ca horace miller built an enormous mansion in piedmont ca at  mountain avenue in  designed by arthur brown famous san francisco architect in  san francisco gas light built its own water gas plant at the potrero gas works the manufacturing of water gas proved successful due to the increased availability of inexpensive petroleum the company decided to construct a modern gas works with both updated water gas manufacturing technology and a modern coalgas plant as a hedge against shortages in the supply of oil in  the north beach gas works was completed under the direction of san francisco gas light president and engineer joseph b crockett the facility was the largest gas holder in the us west of chicago in  the edison light and power company merged with the san francisco gas light company to form the new san francisco gas and electric companyconsolidation of gas and electric companies solved problems for both utilities by eliminating competition and producing economic savings through joint operation– other companies that began operation as active competitors but eventually merged into the san francisco gas and electric company included the equitable gas light company the independent electric light and power company and the independent gas and power company in  the company purchased its main competitor for gas lighting the pacific gas improvement company– pacific gas and electric companyedit pacific gas and electric company plant in sacramento  according to pges  history timeline on their webpage the san francisco gas and electric company and the california gas and electric corporation merged to form the pacific gas and electric company pge on october   the consolidation provided the california gas and electric corporation with access to the large san francisco market and a base for further financing the san francisco gas and electric company in turn was able to reinforce its electric system which until then had been powered entirely by steamoperated generating plants and could not compete with lower cost hydroelectric power– after the merger was formally completed engineers and management from both organizations formulated plans for coordinating and unifying the two gas and electric systems– however the two firms maintained separate corporate identities until – pges natural gas transmission system serving millions of california homes pge began delivering natural gas to san francisco and northern california in  through the longest pipeline in the world connecting the texas gas fields to northern california with compressor stations that included cooling towers every  miles  km at topock arizona on the state line and near the town of hinkley california with the introduction of natural gas the company began retiring its polluting gas manufacturing facilities though it kept some plants on standby today there is a network of eight compressor stations linked by  miles of distribution pipelines and over  miles of transportation pipelines serving  million customers from bakersfield to the oregon border in the s and s at both topock and hinkley compressor stations hexavalent chromium in the form of an additive was used in rustprevention in the cooling towers that prepared the gas for transportation through pge’s pipeline to northern and central california these cooling waters were then disposed of adjacent to the compressor stations in  charles m coleman—who worked for pges publicity department—completed his book entitled p g and e of california the centennial story of pacific gas and electric company – the  san francisco earthquakeedit pge was significantly affected by the  san francisco earthquake the companys assorted central offices were damaged by the quake and destroyed by the subsequent fire its san francisco gas and electric company subsidiary in particular suffered significant infrastructure loss as its distribution systems—miles of gas mains and electric wires—were dissevered only two gas and two electric plants all located far from the city survived the destruction– these functioning facilities—including the new foot crude oil gas works at potrero point—played critical roles in san franciscos rebuilding efforts many of pges utility competitors ceased operation following the great earthquake however the companys substantial capital allowed it to survive rebuild and expand sacramento electric gas and railway companyedit in  pge purchased the sacramento electric gas and railway company and took control of its railway operations in and around sacramento the sacramento city street railway began operating under the pacific gas  electric name in  and its track and services subsequently expanded by  the sacramento street railway division operated  streetcars on  miles  km of track pges streetcars were powered by the companys hydroelectric plant in folsom in  pge sold the rail service to pacific city lines which was later acquired by national city lines several streetcar lines were soon converted to bus service and the track was abandoned entirely in  during this same period pacific city lines and its successor national city lines with funding from general motors firestone tire standard oil of california through a subsidiary federal engineering phillips petroleum and mack trucks were buying streetcar lines and rapidly converting most of them to bus service this consortium was convicted in  of federal charges involving conspiracy to monopolize interstate commerce in the sale of buses and supplies to national city lines and its subsidiaries the actions became known as the great american streetcar scandal or the general motors streetcar conspiracy further consolidation and expansionedit pge general office building in san francisco within a few years of its incorporation pge made significant inroads into northern californias hydroelectric industry through purchase of existing water storage and conveyance facilities these included many reservoirs dams ditches and flumes built by mining interests in the sierras that were no longer commercially viable by  pge was the largest integrated utility system on the pacific coast the company handled  percent of the electric and gas business in california its operations spanned  square miles across  counties the company expanded in the s through strategic consolidation important acquisitions during this period included the california telephone and light company the western states gas and electric company and the sierra and san francisco power company which provided hydropower to san franciscos streetcars– these three companies added valuable properties and power and water sources by the end of  pge had nearly one million customers and provided electricity to  northern californian communities– in  pge purchased majority stock holdings in two major californian utility systems—great western power and san joaquin light and power—from the north american company a new york investment firm in return north american received shares of pges common stock worth  million pge also gained control of two smaller utilities midland counties public service and the fresno water company which was later sold the acquisition of these utilities did not result in an immediate merger of property and personnel the great western power company and the san joaquin company remained separate corporate entities for several more years but through this final major consolidation pge soon served nearly all of northern and central california through one integrated system– natural gasedit the gas industry market structure was dramatically altered by the discovery of massive natural gas fields throughout the american southwest beginning in  the fuel was cleaner than manufactured gas and less expensive to produce while natural gas sources were abundant in southern california no economical sources were available in northern california in  pge constructed a mile pipeline from the kettleman oil field to bring natural gas to san francisco the city became the first major urban area to switch from manufactured gas to natural gas the transition required the adjustment of burners and airflow valves on  million appliances in  pge expanded distribution with an additional mile pipeline from milpitas pge gradually retired its gas manufacturing facilities although some plants were kept on standby defense activities boosted natural gas sales in california during world war ii but cut deeply into the states natural reserves– in  pge entered into a contract with the southern california gas company and the southern counties gas company to purchase natural gas through a new mile pipeline running from texas and new mexico to los angeles– another agreement was reached with the el paso natural gas company of texas for gas delivery to the californiaarizona border in  pge completed a mile main that connected with the el paso network at the state line– during this period of expansion pge was involved in legal proceedings with the securities and exchange commission regarding the companys status as a subsidiary of the north american company as outlined by the public utility holding company act of  a utility subsidiary was defined as a utility company with more than  of their stock held by a public utility holding company though  of pge stock was held by the north american company at this time pge filed with the sec to be exempted from subsidiary status on the grounds that  ownership did not give the north american company control and because the north american company occupied only two board member spots– the north american company backed pges request by stating that they were involved in business operations in a limited capacity the request remained unresolved until  when the north american company sold off stocks that brought its ownership to below  the sec then ruled that pge was not a subsidiary of the north american company in  the north american company sold its remaining stock in pge– nuclear plants and gas pipelinesedit in  the company brought vallecitos nuclear center the first privately owned and operated nuclear reactor in the united states online in pleasanton california the reactor initially produced  kilowatts of power enough to power a town of  in addition to nuclear power pge continued to develop natural gas supplies as well in  the company began working to obtain approval for the import of a large quantity of natural gas from alberta canada to california via a pipeline constructed by westcoast transmission co and the alberta and southern gas company on the canadian side and by pacific gas transmission company a subsidiary of pge on the us side construction of the pipeline lasted  months testing began in  and the completed mile pipeline was dedicated in early  pge began construction on another nuclear facility the diablo canyon power plant in  originally slated to come online in  the plants opening was delayed for several years due to environmental protests and concerns over the safety of the plant’s construction testing of the plant began in  and energy production was brought up to full power in  during the construction of the diablo canyon plant pge continued its efforts to bring natural gas supplies from the north to their service area in california in  the company began exploring possibilities for a mile pipeline from alaska which would travel through the mackenzie river valley and on to join with the previously constructed pipeline originating in alberta in  the mackenzie valley pipeline project received approval from the us federal power commission and support from the carter administration the pipeline still required approval from canada however plans for the pipeline were placed on hold in  by a canadian judge justice thomas r berger of british columbia shelved the project for at least  years citing concerns from first nations groups whose land the pipeline would have traversed as well as potential environmental impacts in  the greatgrandson of pges founder george h roe—david roe published his book entitled dynamos and virgins during the time when there was a growing antinuclearpower movement david roe who was an environmentalist and the environmental defense funds west coast general counsel mounted an assault on the longstanding assumption that steady growth in coal and nucleargenerating capacity was the only solution to the nations energy needs he based his arguments on an economic analysis aimed at showing that a shift to energy conservation and alternative energy sources alone could slake the thirst for electricity postwar eraedit as of december  pge operated  electric generating units and  generating stations  miles  km of transmission lines and  miles  km of distribution system in  pge reorganized as a holding company pge corporation it consisted of two subsidiaries—pge the regulated utility and a nonregulated energy business in the later s under electricity market deregulation this utility sold off most of its natural gas power plants the utility retained all of its hydroelectric plants the diablo canyon power plant and a few natural gas plants but the large natural gas plants it sold made up a large portion of its generating capacity this had the effect of requiring the utility to buy power from the energy generators at fluctuating prices while being forced to sell the power to consumers at a fixed cost however the market for electricity was dominated by the enron corporation which with help from other corporations artificially pushed prices for electricity ever higher this led to the california electricity crisis that began in  on path  a transmission corridor pge built with a critical power shortage rolling blackouts began on january   bankruptcyedit main article california electricity crisis in  a change in the regulation of californias public utilities including pge began the california public utility commission cpuc set the rates that pge could charge customers and required them to provide as much power as the customers wanted at rates set by the cpuc in the summer of  a drought in the northwest states and in california reduced the amount of hydroelectric power available usually pge could buy cheap hydroelectric power under long term contracts with the bonneville dam etc drought and delays in approval of new power plants and market manipulation decreased available electric power generation capacity that could be generated in state or bought under long term contracts out of state hot weather brought on higher usage rolling blackouts etc with little excess generating capacity of its own pge was forced to buy electricity out of state from suppliers without long term contracts because pge had to buy additional electricity to meet demand some suppliers took advantage of this requirement and manipulated the market by creating artificial shortages and charged very high electrical rates the cpuc refused to adjust the allowable electric rates unable to change rates and sell electricity to consumers for what it cost them on the open market pge started hemorrhaging cash pge company the utility not the holding company entered bankruptcy under chapter  on april   the state of california tried to bail out the utility and provide power to pges  million customers under the same rules that required the state to buy electricity at market rate high cost to meet demand and sell it at lower fixed price and as a result the state also lost significant amounts of money the crisis cost pge and the state somewhere between  and  billion there is some evidence that this crisis played an important part in the eventual recall of california governor gray davis pge company the utility emerged from bankruptcy in april

the warrenalquist act which created and gives legal authority to the california energy commission to effectively prohibit the construction of new nuclear power plants the environmental defense fund edf filed as an intervenor in pges  general rate case grc claiming that the companys requests for rate increases were based on unrealistically high projections of load growth furthermore edf claimed that pge could more costeffectively encourage industrial cogeneration and energy efficiency than build more power plants as a result of edfs involvement in pges rate cases the company was eventually

references  external links historyedit early historyedit san francisco gasedit in the s manufactured gas was introduced in the united states as a means of lighting gasworks were built in the larger eastern american cities but there was no gas industry in the west however in san francisco street lighting was available only on merchant street in the form of oil lamps three brothers—peter james and michael donahue—became interested in gas manufacturing while running the foundry that later became union iron works the largest shipbuilding operation on the west coast joseph g eastland an engineer and clerk at the foundry joined them in gathering as much information on gas making as they could find in july  james applied for and received from the common council of the city of san francisco a franchise to erect a gasworks lay pipes in the streets and install street lamps to light the city with brilliant gas the council specified that gas should be supplied to households at such rates as will make it to their interest to use it in preference to any other material– the donahue brothers and eastland incorporated the san francisco gas company on august   with  of authorized capital the company became the first gas utility in the west its official seal bore the inscription fiat lux—let there be light—the same slogan later adopted by the university of california there were  original stockholders and the three donahue brothers subscribed for  of the  shares the original location for the gas works was bounded by first fremont howard and natoma streets south of market on the then shore of the san francisco bay work on the plant started in november  and it was ready for operation only a few months later on the night of february   the streets of san francisco were for the first time lighted by gas to celebrate the event the company held a gala banquet at the oriental hotel gas lighting quickly gained public favor in the first year of operation there were  customers that number more than doubled the next year to  by the end of  the company had laid more than  ½ miles of pipe and  street lamps were in operation the growing popularity of gas light led to the establishment of competing gas companies including aubin patent gas company and citizens gas company these smaller companies were quickly acquired by the san francisco gas company however one rival provided serious competition– the city gas company was founded in april  by the bank of california to compete with the gas monopoly held by the donahue brothers operation city gas began operation in  and initiated a price war with the san francisco gas company– in  the companies negotiated their consolidation as a compromise and the bank of california gained part ownership of the most lucrative gas monopoly in the west on april   the san francisco gas light company was formed representing a merger of the san francisco gas company the city gas company and the metropolitan gas company– san francisco gas and electricedit gas utilities including san francisco gas light faced new competition with the introduction of electric lighting to california– according to a  pge publication and their  commissioned history in  san francisco was the first city in the us to have a central generating station for electric customers to stay competitive the san francisco gas light company introduced the argand lamp that same year the lamp increased the light capacity of gas street lamps but proved to be an expensive improvement and was not generally adopted– meanwhile the demand for electric light in the stores and factories of downtown san francisco continued to grow the first electric street light was erected in  in front of city hall and the electrical grid supporting it was gradually extended a second generating station was constructed in  by the california electric light company to increase production capacity– new competition also emerged in the s in the form of water gas an improved illuminant patented by thaddeus lowe the united gas improvement company a water gas manufacturer organized after purchasing the lowe gas patents acquired a lease and then an interest in san franciscos central gas light company on november  – united was acquired by the pacific gas improvement company in  under the management of president albert miller pacific gas improvement developed into a formidable competitor to san francisco gas light– horace a miller secretary and c o g miller christian otto gerberding miller president owned and controlled not only the pacific gas improvement company but also the pacific gas lighting company pacific lighting company cog miller is buried in a pyramid mausoleum at mountain view cemetery oakland ca horace miller built an enormous mansion in piedmont ca at  mountain avenue in  designed by arthur brown famous san francisco architect in  san francisco gas light built its own water gas plant at the potrero gas works the manufacturing of water gas proved successful due to the increased availability of inexpensive petroleum the company decided to construct a modern gas works with both updated water gas manufacturing technology and a modern coalgas plant as a hedge against shortages in the supply of oil in  the north beach gas works was completed under the direction of san francisco gas light president and engineer joseph b crockett the facility was the largest gas holder in the us west of chicago in  the edison light and power company merged with the san francisco gas light company to form the new san francisco gas and electric companyconsolidation of gas and electric companies solved problems for both utilities by eliminating competition and producing economic savings through joint operation– other companies that began operation as active competitors but eventually merged into the san francisco gas and electric company included the equitable gas light company the independent electric light and power company and the independent gas and power company in  the company purchased its main competitor for gas lighting the pacific gas improvement company– pacific gas and electric companyedit pacific gas and electric company plant in sacramento  according to pges  history timeline on their webpage the san francisco gas and electric company and the california gas and electric corporation merged to form the pacific gas and electric company pge on october   the consolidation provided the california gas and electric corporation with access to the large san francisco market and a base for further financing the san francisco gas and electric company in turn was able to reinforce its electric system which until then had been powered entirely by steamoperated generating plants and could not compete with lower cost hydroelectric power– after the merger was formally completed engineers and management from both organizations formulated plans for coordinating and unifying the two gas and electric systems– however the two firms maintained separate corporate identities until – pges natural gas transmission system serving millions of california homes pge began delivering natural gas to san francisco and northern california in  through the longest pipeline in the world connecting the texas gas fields to northern california with compressor stations that included cooling towers every  miles  km at topock arizona on the state line and near the town of hinkley california with the introduction of natural gas the company began retiring its polluting gas manufacturing facilities though it kept some plants on standby today there is a network of eight compressor stations linked by  miles of distribution pipelines and over  miles of transportation pipelines serving  million customers from bakersfield to the oregon border in the s and s at both topock and hinkley compressor stations hexavalent chromium in the form of an additive was used in rustprevention in the cooling towers that prepared the gas for transportation through pge’s pipeline to northern and central california these cooling waters were then disposed of adjacent to the compressor stations in  charles m coleman—who worked for pges publicity department—completed his book entitled p g and e of california the centennial story of pacific gas and electric company – the  san francisco earthquakeedit pge was significantly affected by the  san francisco earthquake the companys assorted central offices were damaged by the quake and destroyed by the subsequent fire its san francisco gas and electric company subsidiary in particular suffered significant infrastructure loss as its distribution systems—miles of gas mains and electric wires—were dissevered only two gas and two electric plants all located far from the city survived the destruction– these functioning facilities—including the new foot crude oil gas works at potrero point—played critical roles in san franciscos rebuilding efforts many of pges utility competitors ceased operation following the great earthquake however the companys substantial capital allowed it to survive rebuild and expand sacramento electric gas and railway companyedit in  pge purchased the sacramento electric gas and railway company and took control of its railway operations in and around sacramento the sacramento city street railway began operating under the pacific gas  electric name in  and its track and services subsequently expanded by  the sacramento street railway division operated  streetcars on  miles  km of track pges streetcars were powered by the companys hydroelectric plant in folsom in  pge sold the rail service to pacific city lines which was later acquired by national city lines several streetcar lines were soon converted to bus service and the track was abandoned entirely in  during this same period pacific city lines and its successor national city lines with funding from general motors firestone tire standard oil of california through a subsidiary federal engineering phillips petroleum and mack trucks were buying streetcar lines and rapidly converting most of them to bus service this consortium was convicted in  of federal charges involving conspiracy to monopolize interstate commerce in the sale of buses and supplies to national city lines and its subsidiaries the actions became known as the great american streetcar scandal or the general motors streetcar conspiracy further consolidation and expansionedit pge general office building in san francisco within a few years of its incorporation pge made significant inroads into northern californias hydroelectric industry through purchase of existing water storage and conveyance facilities these included many reservoirs dams ditches and flumes built by mining interests in the sierras that were no longer commercially viable by  pge was the largest integrated utility system on the pacific coast the company handled  percent of the electric and gas business in california its operations spanned  square miles across  counties the company expanded in the s through strategic consolidation important acquisitions during this period included the california telephone and light company the western states gas and electric company and the sierra and san francisco power company which provided hydropower to san franciscos streetcars– these three companies added valuable properties and power and water sources by the end of  pge had nearly one million customers and provided electricity to  northern californian communities– in  pge purchased majority stock holdings in two major californian utility systems—great western power and san joaquin light and power—from the north american company a new york investment firm in return north american received shares of pges common stock worth  million pge also gained control of two smaller utilities midland counties public service and the fresno water company which was later sold the acquisition of these utilities did not result in an immediate merger of property and personnel the great western power company and the san joaquin company remained separate corporate entities for several more years but through this final major consolidation pge soon served nearly all of northern and central california through one integrated system– natural gasedit the gas industry market structure was dramatically altered by the discovery of massive natural gas fields throughout the american southwest beginning in  the fuel was cleaner than manufactured gas and less expensive to produce while natural gas sources were abundant in southern california no economical sources were available in northern california in  pge constructed a mile pipeline from the kettleman oil field to bring natural gas to san francisco the city became the first major urban area to switch from manufactured gas to natural gas the transition required the adjustment of burners and airflow valves on  million appliances in  pge expanded distribution with an additional mile pipeline from milpitas pge gradually retired its gas manufacturing facilities although some plants were kept on standby defense activities boosted natural gas sales in california during world war ii but cut deeply into the states natural reserves– in  pge entered into a contract with the southern california gas company and the southern counties gas company to purchase natural gas through a new mile pipeline running from texas and new mexico to los angeles– another agreement was reached with the el paso natural gas company of texas for gas delivery to the californiaarizona border in  pge completed a mile main that connected with the el paso network at the state line– during this period of expansion pge was involved in legal proceedings with the securities and exchange commission regarding the companys status as a subsidiary of the north american company as outlined by the public utility holding company act of  a utility subsidiary was defined as a utility company with more than  of their stock held by a public utility holding company though  of pge stock was held by the north american company at this time pge filed with the sec to be exempted from subsidiary status on the grounds that  ownership did not give the north american company control and because the north american company occupied only two board member spots– the north american company backed pges request by stating that they were involved in business operations in a limited capacity the request remained unresolved until  when the north american company sold off stocks that brought its ownership to below  the sec then ruled that pge was not a subsidiary of the north american company in  the north american company sold its remaining stock in pge– nuclear plants and gas pipelinesedit in  the company brought vallecitos nuclear center the first privately owned and operated nuclear reactor in the united states online in pleasanton california the reactor initially produced  kilowatts of power enough to power a town of  in addition to nuclear power pge continued to develop natural gas supplies as well in  the company began working to obtain approval for the import of a large quantity of natural gas from alberta canada to california via a pipeline constructed by westcoast transmission co and the alberta and southern gas company on the canadian side and by pacific gas transmission company a subsidiary of pge on the us side construction of the pipeline lasted  months testing began in  and the completed mile pipeline was dedicated in early  pge began construction on another nuclear facility the diablo canyon power plant in  originally slated to come online in  the plants opening was delayed for several years due to environmental protests and concerns over the safety of the plant’s construction testing of the plant began in  and energy production was brought up to full power in  during the construction of the diablo canyon plant pge continued its efforts to bring natural gas supplies from the north to their service area in california in  the company began exploring possibilities for a mile pipeline from alaska which would travel through the mackenzie river valley and on to join with the previously constructed pipeline originating in alberta in  the mackenzie valley pipeline project received approval from the us federal power commission and support from the carter administration the pipeline still required approval from canada however plans for the pipeline were placed on hold in  by a canadian judge justice thomas r berger of british columbia shelved the project for at least  years citing concerns from first nations groups whose land the pipeline would have traversed as well as potential environmental impacts in  the greatgrandson of pges founder george h roe—david roe published his book entitled dynamos and virgins during the time when there was a growing antinuclearpower movement david roe who was an environmentalist and the environmental defense funds west coast general counsel mounted an assault on the longstanding assumption that steady growth in coal and nucleargenerating capacity was the only solution to the nations energy needs he based his arguments on an economic analysis aimed at showing that a shift to energy conservation and alternative energy sources alone could slake the thirst for electricity postwar eraedit as of december  pge operated  electric generating units and  generating stations  miles  km of transmission lines and  miles  km of distribution system in  pge reorganized as a holding company pge corporation it consisted of two subsidiaries—pge the regulated utility and a nonregulated energy business in the later s under electricity market deregulation this utility sold off most of its natural gas power plants the utility retained all of its hydroelectric plants the diablo canyon power plant and a few natural gas plants but the large natural gas plants it sold made up a large portion of its generating capacity this had the effect of requiring the utility to buy power from the energy generators at fluctuating prices while being forced to sell the power to consumers at a fixed cost however the market for electricity was dominated by the enron corporation which with help from other corporations artificially pushed prices for electricity ever higher this led to the california electricity crisis that began in  on path  a transmission corridor pge built with a critical power shortage rolling blackouts began on january   bankruptcyedit main article california electricity crisis in  a change in the regulation of californias public utilities including pge began the california public utility commission cpuc set the rates that pge could charge customers and required them to provide as much power as the customers wanted at rates set by the cpuc in the summer of  a drought in the northwest states and in california reduced the amount of hydroelectric power available usually pge could buy cheap hydroelectric power under long term contracts with the bonneville dam etc drought and delays in approval of new power plants and market manipulation decreased available electric power generation capacity that could be generated in state or bought under long term contracts out of state hot weather brought on higher usage rolling blackouts etc with little excess generating capacity of its own pge was forced to buy electricity out of state from suppliers without long term contracts because pge had to buy additional electricity to meet demand some suppliers took advantage of this requirement and manipulated the market by creating artificial shortages and charged very high electrical rates the cpuc refused to adjust the allowable electric rates unable to change rates and sell electricity to consumers for what it cost them on the open market pge started hemorrhaging cash pge company the utility not the holding company entered bankruptcy under chapter  on april   the state of california tried to bail out the utility and provide power to pges  million customers under the same rules that required the state to buy electricity at market rate high cost to meet demand and sell it at lower fixed price and as a result the state also lost significant amounts of money the crisis cost pge and the state somewhere between  and  billion there is some evidence that this crisis played an important part in the eventual recall of california governor gray davis pge company the utility emerged from bankruptcy in april  after paying  billion to its hundreds of creditors as part of the reorganization pges  million electricity customers will have to pay abovemarket prices for several years to cancel the debt

 mw the three installations will initially generate enough electricity to power more than  residences in april  pges next blog reported that pge was asking the california public utilities commission to approve a project by the company solaren to deliver  megawatts of power to california from space this method of obtaining electricity from the sun eliminates mostly the darkness of night experienced from solar sites on the surface of the earth according to pge spokesman jonathan marshall energy purchase costs are expected to be similar to other renewable energy contracts pge and the environmentedit beginning in the mids regulatory and political developments began to push utilities in california away from a traditional business model in  the california state legislature amended the warrenalquist act which created and gives legal authority to the california energy commission to effectively prohibit the construction of new nuclear power plants the environmental defense fund edf filed as an intervenor in pges  general rate case grc claiming that the companys requests for rate increases were based on unrealistically high projections of load growth furthermore edf claimed that pge could more costeffectively encourage industrial cogeneration and energy efficiency than build more power plants as a result of edfs involvement in pges rate cases the company was eventually fined  million by the california public utilities commission for failing to adequately implement energy efficiency programs since darbee took control of the pge company in  pge has aggressively promoted its environmental image through a variety of programs and campaignscitation needed in the early first decade of the st century the ceo of pge corporation peter darbee and thenceo of pacific

cheapest and most efficient commercially available—at their compressor station plants in their cooling towers along the natural gas transmission pipelines pge did not inform the local water board of the contamination until december   stalling action on a response to the contamination the residents of hinkley filed a successful lawsuit against pge in which the company paid  million— the largest settlement ever paid in a directaction lawsuit in us history the legal case which was dramatized in the  film erin brockovich became an international cause célèbre in response in  at the request of the calepa the chromate toxicity review committee was formed to investigate the toxicity of chromium when ingested in  a senate hearing revealed that the committees supposedlyclarification needed blueribbon members included pge defense expert witnesses who had influenced the final august  report which found in pges favor concluding that other reports were alarmist with spuriously high statistics and that further evaluation should be handled by academics in laboratory settings not by regulators through time the report was recanted but it set back regulation of chromium  for many yearscitation needed in july  california became the first state to acknowledge that ingested chromium is linked to cancer and as a result has established a maximum chromium contaminant level mcl of  parts per billion ppb in setting the regulations it was acknowledged that in recent scientific studies in laboratory animals hexavalent chromium has also been linked to cancer when ingested previously when older chromium mcls were set at the time total chromium mcls were established ingested hexavalent chromium associated with consumption of drinking water was not considered to pose a cancer risk as is now the case by  pge had cleaned up  acres but it is estimated the remediation process will take another  years pge built a concrete wall barrier that is about a halfmilelong to contain the plume pump ethanol into the ground to convert chromium into chromium and have planted acres of alfalfa they created a chicken farm to use the alfalfa pge uses irrigation to maintain these large circles of green in the otherwise desert area and was asked to stop because of the ongoing danger of residents inhaling chromium  in  the california regional water quality control board lahontan region served pge with a new order to cleanup sic and abate the effects of the discharge of chromium waste or threatened pollution or nuisance by the time of the report the plume had expanded to  miles in length and approximately  miles in width throughout the hinkley valley and into harper dry lake valley polluting new areas in early  the new york times described hinkley as having been slowly turned into a ghost town due to the contamination of the area with owners unable to see their properties epidemiologist john morgan produced a  report for the california cancer registry in which he argued that there was no cancer cluster in hinkley related to chromium  in one study morgan had claimed that cancer rates in hinkley remained unremarkable from  to  saying that the  cases of cancer reported during the most recent survey of  through  were less than what he would expect based on demographics and the regional rate of cancer in  the center for public integrity found glaring weaknesses in morgans  analysis that challenged the validity of his findings in his first study he dismisses what others see as a genuine cancer cluster in hinkley in his latest analysis he excludes people who were exposed to the worst contamination sierra blazeedit on june   a nevada county jury in nevada city found pge guilty of a pattern of treetrimming violations that sparked a devastating

was damaged when one of pges naturalgas pipelines that was at least  years old  inches  centimeters in diameter and located under a street intersection in a residential area exploded sending a foot section of pipe weighing  pounds flying through the air fueled by blowing natural gas the blast created a crater at the epicenter and killed eight people and injured nearly five dozen more while destroying about  homes the usgs reported that the shock wave was similar to a  magnitude earthquake following the event the company was heavily criticized for ignoring the warnings of a state inspector in  and for failing to provide adequate safety procedures the incident then came under investigation by the national transportation safety board ntsb on august   the ntsb released its findings which placed fault for the blast on pge the report stated that the pipeline installed in  that later burst did not even meet standards of that time pge was charged with twelve criminal felony counts alleging violations of the natural gas pipeline safety act pge pleaded not guilty to the criminal counts in both the initial and superseding indictments opting to put the prosecutors to their proof on april   a united states grand jury in san francisco charged pge with knowingly and willfully violating the natural gas pipeline safety act in august  the california public utilities

electric meters customers whose meters were replaced with smart meters reported seeing their energy bills spike up multiplefolds and accused the company of deliberately inflating their bills along with questioning the accuracy of the meters complaints of pges failing to honor customers refusal of upgrading their meters also surfaced although the contractor that installed the meters would honor these requests pge would eventually come out and replace them despite objections subsequently the california public utilities commission would conduct an investigation and find that of the  smart meter field tests  meters were successfully tested and  passed average registration accuracy one meter was found to have serious errors and was malfunctioning on arrival while another was found to have serious event errors upon installation these meters were therefore excluded from testing proposition edit in  pge was accused of attempting to stifle competition with proposition  which mandated approval from twothirds of voters to start or expand a local utility critics argued that this would make it harder for local governments to create their own power utilities thus effectively giving pge a monopoly the company was also rebuked for supplying  million to support the ballot measure when opponents raised  in the campaign the proposition was voted down with  in opposition and  in favor tax

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible

characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed
