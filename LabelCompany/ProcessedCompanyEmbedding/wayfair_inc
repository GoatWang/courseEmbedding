directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not

sale furniture clearance this is a page that does not use id based filters furniture when it comes to furnishing your home finding the perfect furniture that is both stylish and functional is one of the best parts about owning a home you can let your inner interior designer flourish sorting through all the decoration options deciding on how to blend colors patterns and materials with such variety in home furniture its important to know the differences between these styles and materials so you can find what works best for you for instance will victorian furniture fit in with your design if you want to create a vibrant room with bright colors and contrasting highlights or does it make more sense to use a brighter theme and utilize coastal furniture to accomplish your goals well try to go over all these details here so you can get on your way to finding the best home furniture for you furniture styles there are many styles that you can use and combine to create the aesthetic look that you want from coastal to modern to victorian home furniture styles can literally come in any shape or color so how do you decide what style works best for you it comes down to how you want to present your home if you live near a beach and want to have a coastal style you can blend your coastal furniture which are generally wickers and bright colored couches with light blue walls and yellow highlights or if you want a more traditional look victorian furniture might fit your style more effectively this furniture type is usually made from dark solid wood and come with classic designs and you can blend victorian furniture with darker walls and different colored finishes of wood to have a complete home design finally modern furniture is the most recent type of style modern furniture is simple and is most commonly finished in black or white to create a minimalist look to the home furniture materials lastly you need to decide what material you prefer the most for your furniture each material has its own benefits ranging from durability to aesthetic design to portability for example if you want a coffee table that is both light and easy to move acrylic furniture is a fantastic option because it has both of those qualities metal is another fantastic material because it will last a long time and there are plenty of design options to choose from because of this materials popularity with the combination of its sheen and the versatility with which it can be shaped metal is a great option to look into as well your material selection isnt limited to only acrylic furniture and metal you can find glass marble or wood in abundance here at wayfair so feel free to mix and match as you wish in order to design your room the way you want sponsored links advertisement feedback

analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and
