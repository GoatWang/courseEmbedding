touchstone funds group trust annual report inside you will find key financial information as well as manager commentaries for the twelve months ended september   during the previous twelve months investors contended with concerns related to the weakening housing market subprimemortgage problems that roiled financialservices companies worldwide higher oil prices the weakening dollar and the potential for slower economic growth however late in the summer investors seemed to be hopeful that the worst of the creditrelated problems from the housing and subprimemortgage markets was over and the federal reserve would be aggressive in its effort to keep the economy from sagging into a recession this view was confirmed as the fed cut its shortterm interest rate by onehalf percentage point in september to  this was the first rate reduction in four years and the steepest in nearly five years this injected the liquidity needed and confidence in the financial markets returned during the year the us equity markets were extremely volatile however most posted double digit returns for the year large cap stocks continued to outperform small cap stocks growth outperformed value for the first time in seven years when we examine where the financial markets may be headed in the year to come we continue to believe that diversification is key to balancing risk and return we recommend that you work with your financial professional to employ a sound asset allocation strategy that invests in a combination of stock bond and money market mutual funds to help keep your financial strategy on course we also suggest maintaining a longterm approach to gain the full potential benefits of investing touchstone is committed to providing investors access to proven institutional money

capital management inc investment philosophy and process the touchstone clover core fixed income fund seeks to produce attractive longterm total returns and a high level of current income by investing in a diversified portfolio of bonds the fund maintains a laddered maturity structure and a weighted average duration that is consistent with an intermediate bond portfolio however individual bonds may have a final maturity from one month to thirty years or more the fund managers combine a top down macro economic outlook with individual security selection evaluation and techniques factors such as the business cycle federal reserve policy and credit spreads are taken into account to establish an overall framework for sector allocation and yield curve positioning as well as the overall posture of the portfolio fund performance and positioning the total return of the touchstone clover core fixed income fund was  for the fiscal year ended september   the total return of the lehman aggregate bond index was  for the same period during the first half of this period the market experienced a further pay off to riskier assets which was to the detriment of the funds relative performance the fund began to pick up ground on its benchmark during the summer as a flight to quality took place in the market which was a short lived trade as september saw risk product recover strategies employed for the period succeeded in their primary goal of preserving capital and providing the safe harbor which is expected from a bond portfolio the assessment that investors were not being adequately compensated for the risk in some of todays securities proved accurate as a significant repricing took place especially in the area of subprime mortgages while these securities are not a big component of the funds benchmark and therefore did not benefit relative performance the fund managers commitment not to chase yield in this area protected client assets from the negative price movements seen in other investment vehicles the funds defensive posture detracted from returns we expect this posture to shift somewhat as there is now better value in risk products than there has been in several years the funds underweight to corporate bond duration had the most significant impact to performance from a sector standpoint wider corporate bond spreads led to weak performance from the sector which benefited the funds relative performance special situation holding slm corp  due  detracted from performance as it was purchased shortly before market conditions and company specific issues caused risk premiums to rise on the companys debt we believe this to be a short term factor and that this bond will be one of the key value added holdings of the fund over time the funds overweight in long duration treasury bonds also hurt performance as yields on year treasuries were slightly higher while the rest of the curve saw yields drop the fund had a significant underweight to the mortgage pass through and corporate bond sector as measured by contribution to duration while this provides a lower risk profile we look to add value in key investments which continue to be the funds holding in slm corp bonds as well as structured credit floating rate notes the funds recent defensive bias of taking less risk produced lower returns than the benchmark however the lower risk seemed like a prudent decision as risk premiums reached record lows as did the transparency in some of todays investment offerings we anticipate significant challenges for active fixed income managers as we continue to expect low absolute returns from the bond market especially in comparison to expense ratios however the recent market disruption is providing some sources of value for the first time in a long time

attractively priced companies that are believed to have superior future earnings potential focus is placed on evaluating the financial characteristics of individual stocks and a companys fundamental data rather than forecasting the trends in markets investment styles or selectors its stock selection process is driven by proprietary technology designed to analyze the fundamentals of more than  securities and to evaluate the relative attractiveness of stocks in its universe axa rosenbergs stock selection process includes two fundamental insights on each company in our universe the valuation model identifies bargains and expensive stocks within each industry and the earnings forecast model identifies companies with superiorinferior yearahead earnings the fundamental valuation of stocks by the valuation model is the heart of our investment process the model first classifies companies into one or more of  business segments valuing each companys individual operating businesses based on assets earnings and sales by business segment in comparison with similar business operations of other companies the model then refines the business segment valuations to account for the financial data only reported at the companywide level including footnote information over  line items in all the result is a single valuation for each of the more than  us broad market companies we follow the difference between axa rosenbergs valuation and the market price reflects an opportunity for profit a second opportunity for profit is captured by our earnings forecast model which combines numerous fundamental variables related to earnings change with variables that capture investor enthusiasm for companies these variables include measures of profitability measures of operational efficiency

portfolios for growth stocks we perform fundamental analysis to determine if the positive business momentum identified by our earnings model will persist in addition the companys balance sheet and cash flows are analyzed to verify that the company has the financial strength required to grow at the rate implied by the model for value stocks we employ a series of screens designed to identify hidden assets that will signify attractive return potential and downside protection to share prices for instance we seek to identify characteristics like a large net cash position undervalued assets such as land overfunded pension assets nonstrategic businesses that can be sold and undervalued brands or market shares then we look for a catalyst for positive change in the companies fundamentals or strategies  a prerequisite if an outoffavor stock is to rise in price otherwise without that catalyst an outoffavor stock can simply fall even more out of favor during the last year we have identified more opportunities using our earnings model which has resulted in the fund having a slight growth tilt the fund was positioned this way to take advantage of owning companies that were experiencing

rose about  a rate that was below the doubledigit norm of the past three years but nevertheless was still above the longterm average of  we also think profit growth may again hit the low double digits in the fourth quarter as long as earnings stay reasonably healthy we think the stock market is in little danger of morphing from a bull to a bear in the near term in our analysis the muchchronicled

value during the year we were able to take the opportunity to initiate positions at what we believe are favorable prices in toro flowers foods and hanesbrands we also eliminated positions from the fund including apria healthcare maf bancorp and tidewater after these companies reached our estimated intrinsic value regarding energy our investment thesis remains the same given our longterm expectations that a longterm tightness in the supplydemand balance that is not fully reflected in the stock prices we believe the portfolio is positioned relatively defensively given the high cash balance and what we believe are holdings at discounts to their intrinsic value certain segments of the portfolio energy for example will likely depend on adequate global economic growth though not necessarily stellar domestic growth in order for the stocks within that sector to be solid performers the portfolio is underweight in the areas of technology and health care which could lead to relative underperformance if those sectors are leaders our year outlook for the equity market is for expected returns in the mid single digits which would be below longterm and recent averages this

months with the dollar weakening and mixed signals coming from economic data anxiety became heightened leading investors began to allocate capital to companies with international exposure and more predictable business profiles this dynamic played well to an overweight in consumer staples and also benefited key holdings such as general electric mcdonalds and exxon mobil the fund continues to focus on identifying inexpensive stocks with improving fundamentals and improving investor sentiment we continue to express a preference for such stocks that also possess international exposure and stable earnings profiles the fund continues to maintain a somewhat defensive stance given its overweight in consumer staples healthcare and utilities and underweight in financial services we are

have also begun to obscure more positive business attributes that could be worthwhile for future investment  pncsrnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd  managements discussion of fund performance

by an independent pricing service money market instruments and other debt securities with a remaining maturity of less than  days are valued at amortized cost which approximates market securities for which market quotations or the nocp are not readily available are valued based on fair value as determined by or under the direction of the board of trustees shares of openend mutual funds in which the funds invest are valued at their respective net asset values as reported by the underlying funds the prices for foreign securities are reported in local currency and converted to us dollars using currency exchange rates for securities that principally trade on a foreign market or exchange a significant gap in time can exist between the time of a particular securitys last trade and the time at which a fund calculates its net asset value the closing prices of such securities may no longer reflect their market value at the time the fund calculates its net asset value if an event that could materially affect the value of those securities a significant event has occurred between the time of the securitys last close and the time that the fund calculates its net asset value a significant event may relate to a single issuer or to an entire market sector if the advisor or subadvisor of a fund becomes aware of a significant event that has occurred with respect to a security or group of securities after the closing of the exchange or market on which the security or securities principally trade but before the time at which the fund calculates its net asset value it may request that a fair value committee meeting be called in addition the funds administrator or subadministrator monitors price movements among certain selected indices securities andor baskets of securities that may be an indicator that the closing prices received earlier from foreign exchanges or markets may not reflect market value at the time the fund calculates its net asset value if price movements in a monitored index or security exceed levels established by the advisor the subadministrator notifies the advisor or subadvisor for any fund holding the relevant securities that such limits have been exceeded in such event the advisor makes the determination whether a fair value committee meeting should be called based on the information provided the international equity fund also uses a thirdparty fair valuation vendor the vendor provides a fair value for foreign securities held by the fund based on certain factors and methodologies involving generally tracking valuation correlations between the us market and each nonus security values from the fair value vendor are applied in the event that there is a movement in the us market that exceeds a specific threshold that has been established by the fair value committee the fair value committee has also established a confidence interval which is used to determine the level of historical correlation between the value of a specific foreign security and movements in the us market before a particular security will be fair valued when the threshold is exceeded in the event that the threshold established by the fair value committee is exceeded on a specific day the fund will value the non us securities in its portfolio that exceed the applicable confidence interval based upon the adjusted prices provided by the fair
