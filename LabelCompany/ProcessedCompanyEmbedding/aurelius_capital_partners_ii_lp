supports nii’s swift emergence from chapter   business wire statement from aurelius capital management lp aurelius supports nii’s swift emergence from chapter  september 5   pm eastern daylight time new yorkbusiness wireaurelius capital management lp today issued the following statement regarding the commencement of chapter  proceedings by nii holdings inc and certain of its us and luxembourg subsidiaries an aureliusmanaged entity is the largest holder of bonds due  and  issued by nii capital corp and the second largest holder across all five series of nii bonds aurelius welcomes nii’s chapter  case as a means to restore the company to financial health and empower management to complete the company’s operational turnaround over the last several months we have worked tirelessly with management toward that objective and we remain dedicated to it we have taken the lead among bondholders in supporting a plan that would allow the company to emerge from chapter  swiftly by deferring until after emergence the resolution through litigation or settlement of many intercreditor disputes aurelius was ready last week to enter into a binding agreement to support a plan the “reserve plan” that would have converted all  billion of nii bonds into  of the reorganized company’s equity before taking into account the rights offering mentioned below and any management incentive plan allocated that equity among the bondholders in accordance with the absolutepriority rule raised fresh equity through a rights offering aurelius offered to backstop  million of that rights offering deferred all intercreditor disputes until after nii emerges from chapter  a portion of the new equity would be placed in reserve and released as each dispute is resolved whether through litigation or settlement any settlements reached before emergence would be taken into account in the initial distribution of shares at emergence the reserve plan would be the best of all worlds because it would restore nii to financial health within a matter of months enable bondholders a full and fair opportunity to resolve any intercreditor disputes in an orderly way honor the absolute priority rule as among bondholders a bondholder group primarily holding bonds of nii’s luxembourg subsidiary has opposed the reserve plan their opposition tells us that they i lack the courage of their convictions and ii hope to extract more by holding the company hostage in chapter  than they would if the intercreditor disputes were resolved in a fair and orderly manner afterward aurelius wants to see nii flourish for the benefit of all bondholders as to intercreditor issues we are content to trust the merits we urge other bondholders to do likewise note aurelius capital management lp does not make any representation

thomas p griesa district judge plaintiffs aurelius capital partners lp aurelius capital master ltd acp master ltd aurelius opportunities fund ii llc and blue angel capital i llc collectively aurelius own beneficial interests in defaulted bonds issued by defendant the republic of argentina the republic on may   aurelius applied for and the court signed two ex parte orders of attachment the first was directed to the interests of certain entities connected with the republic in us patents or pending patent applications the second was directed to royalties generated by license agreements aurelius now moves to confirm the orders of attachment and the republic and nonparty basf corp crossmove to vacate the orders the attachment orders are vacated facts procedural history aurelius has eleven actions in this court pertaining to the republics bond default in  and has been awarded eleven final judgments against the republic for a total of about  billion aurelius also has additional cases pending before the court seeking further money judgments as stated above on may   this court ordered the ex parte attachment of certain patent interests and royalty interests of entities connected with the republic the court also appointed a receiver to preserve the status quo and protect the value of the property covered by the attachment orders the order relating to patent interests the patent attachment order purports to attach property interests held by the republic in us patents or patent applications including any patent interests held by any of the following five argentine entities agencia nacional de promocion cientifica y tecnologica anpct consejo nacional de investigaciones cientificas y tecnicas conicet comision nacional de energia atomica cnea instituto nacional de tecnologia agropecuaria inta or instituto nacional de tecnologia industrial inti the order relating to royalty fees the royalty attachment order focuses on two licensing agreements between inta and basf a chemical company the licensing agreements give basf the right to commercialize a rice gene technology developed by inta and the attachment order purports to attach intas interests in licensing or royalty fees payable under the agreements in plaintiffs request for the royalty attachment order plaintiffs stated upon information and belief basf has incorporated or is in the process of incorporating intas rice technology into its clearfield product line andor other product lines that basf sells in the united states for which it is contractually obligated to pay royalties to inta on the basis of its commercialization of intas rice gene technology in the united states plaintiffs brief at  plaintiffs served the attachment order on basf corporation basf corp a north american company that is present in new york plaintiffs move to confirm both attachment orders they also request that the court enter an order transferring the patent interests to the courtappointed receiver defendant and nonparty basf corp move to vacate both attachment orders there is a voluminous record on these motions about the facts relevant to the various issues raised much of this submission relates to the nature of the argentine entities and their relation to the republic the issue here is whether the property of the entities can be considered to be the property of the republic for the purposes of attachment to date plaintiffs have identified a variety of scientific and medical technologies that are apparently the subject of  patents and pending patent applications these patents and patent applications involve various of the argentine entities however as far as the record shows none of the patents have given rise to commercial activity in the united states within the meaning of the relevant statute the foreign sovereign immunities act the fsia and only two pending patent applications involve technology which is used in commercial activity those pending applications relate to intas rice gene technology this technology is also the subject of the licensing agreements referred to earlier consequently there is no need for the court in this opinion to describe any of the entities except for inta and there is no need to describe any of the patents or pending patent applications except those of inta instituto nacional de tecnologia agropecuaria inta the fsia distinguishes the sovereign state from an agency or instrumentality of the sovereign state there are somewhat different rules regarding attachments depending on whether it is the sovereigns property or an instrumentalitys property that is sought to be attached plaintiffs contend that inta is part of the republic they make no argument that there can be an attachment if inta is an agency or instrumentality of the republic inta is a decentralized autarkic agency under argentine law autarkic entities have full capacity to act on their own behalf and in their own name enter into contracts and to serve as plaintiffs or defendants in legal proceedings they are created to serve public governmental purposes inta is a governmental research institution within the argentine ministry of agriculture livestock and fisheries according to the executive decree that created inta its mission is to promote agricultural science and research pursuant to the directives of the national executive branch in order to fulfill the states responsibility to promote the efficient development of agricultural production inta decree no  at preamble  arts  inta is headed by the argentine minister of agriculture it is governed by a tenmember advisory board seven of whom are nominated by independent agricultural entities including agricultural producers and agronomy and veterinary schools the board has the power to issue intas internal rules prepare a budget and hire promote and dismiss personnel the boards members are appointed by the executive branch but the national executive may only appoint individuals that were nominated the advisory board appoints intas national director who is in charge of intas daytoday operations intas budget is made up primarily of tax revenues imposed by the republic and earmarked for intas use along with contributions from provincial governments and other independent sources of operating revenue plaintiffs state that inta generally does not pay any periodic federal taxes while the republic states that inta pays periodic federal taxes the court previously found that inta was a separate agency or instrumentality—rather than a part of the republic—and that another debtor em ltd could not attach a bank account held by inta em ltd v republic of argentina  wl  at  sdny sept   vacated in part on other grounds  wl  sdny sept   in that case the plaintiff sought to attach an account of inta held at bnas new york branch the account contained about  em ltd requested discovery as to inta but the court denied it because the court did not believe that further discovery as to the status of inta is justified id at  the court does not consider itself bound to follow now its ruling with regard to the  bank account and will consider the status of inta anew on this motion intas rice gene technology and the basf licensing agreements inta has developed a rice gene the rice gene and a rice variety incorporating that gene the rice variety that are resistant to herbicides used against red rice a weed that has significantly harmed the output of rice fields worldwide in 5 inta entered into two licensing agreements the rice gene license agreement and the rice variety license agreement with basf agrochemical products bv basf bv a corporation organized under the laws of the netherlands and with its principal place of business there together the agreements granted basf bv exclusive licenses to develop make use and sell intas rice gene and rice variety everywhere in the world outside of uruguay and argentina in exchange for contractual royalties payable to inta basf bv maintains most of the intellectual property rights of the basf group of companies in connection with herbicide tolerant crops basf bv is a dutch subsidiary of basf se one of the worlds leading chemical companies based in germany it has been in existence for more than a decade basf corp is a delaware corporation headquartered in new jersey and is the north american subsidiary of basf se basf bv is affiliated with basf corp but is not owned or controlled by basf corp basf corp is not a party to the inta license agreements basf ses agricultural business includes a line of products marketed and sold under its clearfield brand the clearfield system is a combination of herbicides and seeds that are tolerant to those herbicides although basf sells clearfield rice products in the united states those products do not use any technology developed or licensed by inta intas rice variety has been sold by basf as part of its clearfield product line exclusively in costa rica and brazil inta has received royalties from basf bv for sales in costa rica and brazil inta has not received royalties from basf bv for sales in any other countries including the united states basf has applied in the united states for two patents in intas name with respect to the herbicideresistant rice plants that are at issue the applications remain pending basf corp reports that the process of commercializing an herbicide resistant rice varietal takes  to  years and is unique to each region in which the final product will be sold basf corp has not taken any steps to commercialize a product using intas technology in the united states based on current market conditions there are no plans to do so as noted above basf has already commercialized other herbicide resistant rice varieties under the clearfield brand in the united states as part of the administrative services provided to its affiliate basf bv basf corp has in the past gathered sales information necessary to prepare a written report of royalty payments due under the inta license agreements and has paid the amount due on behalf of basf bv which was immediately reimbursed by basf bv discussion there are various issues that are raised regarding the validity of the attachment of the patents and pending patent applications and the attachment of royalties under the inta license agreements however the court wishes to start with the issue of commercial activity in the united states since the court is constrained to hold that the attachments must be denied on the basis of this issue the legal standards governing whether a creditor of the republic may enforce its claims and judgments against a property interest of the republic arise from the intersection of the foreign sovereign immunities act  usc §  et seq the fsia applicable to judgment enforcement proceedings against foreign governments and new york states pre and postjudgment enforcement procedures applicable pursuant to rules  and  of the federal rules of civil procedure section a of the fsia under section  of the fsia all property of a foreign state is immune from attachment or execution unless an exception to such immunity exists under section  section  in turn provides that property of a foreign state located in the united states and used for a commercial activity in the united states can be attached  usc §   use for commercial activity in the united states the supreme court has held that when a foreign government acts not as regulator of a market but in the manner of a private player within it the foreign sovereigns actions are commercial within the meaning of the fsia republic of argentina v weltover inc 5 us    see also  usc § d the commercial character of an activity shall be determined by reference to the nature of the course of conduct or particular transaction or act rather than by reference to its purpose activity related to licensing of patents has been considered commercial activity see eg intel corp v commonwealth scientific  indus research org 55 fd   fed cir  holding that australias national science agency the assignee of a us registered patent had engaged in commercial activity under the fsia when it participated in patent licensing negotiations in the us even though the negotiations never resulted in a fully executed binding contract however the use requirement of §  is relatively stringent section a does not say that the property in the united states of a foreign state that will be used or could potentially be used for a commercial activity in the united states is not immune from attachment or execution more is required the property in the united states of a foreign state must be used for a commercial activity in the united states upon a judgment entered by a court of the united states or of a state aurelius capital partners lp v republic of argentina 5 fd   d cir  the plain language of the statute suggests that the standard is actual not hypothetical use em ltd v republic of argentina  fd   d cir  the ninth circuit has further held that property must be used in a commercial activity separate from the transaction that generated the property in the first place see afcap inc v chevron overseas congo ltd 5 fd  5 th cir  internal quotation omitted what matters under section a is what the property is used for not how it was generated or produced id at  internal quotations omitted see also nml capital ltd v republic of argentina  wl  at  sdny apr   while a contract to purchase goods in the united states constitutes commercial activity that property is not subject to attachment if it is not itself used for commercial activity within our borders aside from the intabasf license agreements considered in more detail below there is no indication that any of the us patents or patent applications have been commercialized in the united states the argentine entities have applied for and in some cases been granted us patents however the filing of patent applications and the obtaining of patents represents at most the generation of a property interest not its commercial use the same is true with respect to intas pending patent applications according to basf corp there are no plans to commercialize intas technologies—or by extension intas pending patent applications—within the united states without evidence that the republic is actively using its patent interests for commercial activity in the united states the interests cannot be attached pursuant to the fsia therefore the patent attachment order must be vacated the royalty attachment order with respect to intas license agreements with basf presents somewhat different issues plaintiffs argue that the republic has used its rice gene technology in the united states because it has contracted with an american company—basf corp—to market develop and commercialize the technology as noted above the license agreements at issue are between inta and basf bv a dutch entity it is true that basf corp which is located in the united states has paid some royalty fees to inta on behalf of its affiliate basf bv however the fact that basf corp has acted or is acting as a paying agent in the united states does not mean that intas contractual right to receive royalties related to its rice gene technology—or even the rice gene technology itself—was put to commercial use in the united states basf corp used funds in the united states to temporarily advance royalty payment to inta for sales in costa rica and brazil this does not constitute commercial activity in the united states the royalty attachment order must be vacated  situs of the property rights the republic argues that the patent attachment order should be vacated because any interests the republic has in us patents or pending patent applications cannot be said to be located in the united states as is required for a proper attachment under  usc §  the court does not reach this question because as noted above there is nothing in the record to indicate that any of the property interests in question have been used for a commercial activity in the united states once again however the royalty attachment order presents somewhat different issues in plaintiffs submissions in support of their application for the royalty attachment order they stated their belief that basf had incorporated or was in the process of incorporating intas rice technology into its clearfield product line andor other product lines that basf sells in the united states for which it is contractually obligated to pay royalties to inta on the basis of its commercialization of intas rice gene technology in the united states it now appears that this belief was mistaken as noted above inta has entered into two licensing agreements with basf bv granting basf bv exclusive licenses to develop make use and sell intas rice gene and rice variety everywhere in the world outside of uruguay and argentina in exchange for contractual royalties payable to inta to date basf has sold products containing these technologies in costa rica and brazil only and has paid royalties only for sales in those countries plaintiffs have served the attachment order on basf corp which is located in the united states although basf corp has paid some royalties to inta on behalf of its affiliate basf bv basf corp is not a party to the license agreements basf corp argues that the royalty attachment order should be vacated because plaintiffs incorrectly seek to enforce the order on basf corp which is not a party to the inta license agreements and which does not hold any assets of the republic or of inta plaintiffs argue that the attachment order is valid because they seek to attach the republics intangible contractual rights to receive royalties under the licensing agreements plaintiffs claim that these rights are located in the united states because basf corp has performed services under the agreements on behalf of basf bv plaintiffs also suggest that the republic andor basf structured these agreements as a sort of shell game to avoid attachment under the fsia if an attachment order is to be served on a person other than the defendant that entity must at the time of the attachment be in the possession or custody of property in which such person knows or has reason to believe the defendant has an interest cplr § b courts must be extremely reluctant to disregard corporate form and should do so only when the corporation primarily transacts the business of the dominating interest rather than its own us v funds held in the name or for the benefit of wetterer  fd   d cir  internal citation omitted despite plaintiffs contentions there is no indication whatsoever that basf bv was created or is being used to engage in a shell game it is a legitimate corporate entity—separate from basf corp—that has been in existence for more than a decade basf bv is not located in the united states and no entity related to basf or inta has sold any products containing the inta technologies in the united states the license agreements and the royalty rights they give rise to are not located in the united states basf corps services on behalf of basf bv do not change this fact intas relationship to the republic as noted above the fsia distinguishes the sovereign state from an agency or instrumentality of the sovereign state and somewhat different rules apply to attachments depending on whether it is the sovereigns property or an instrumentalitys property that is sought to be attached the outcome is not clear as to whether inta is part of the argentine government or is a separate agency or instrumentality there are factors for each side although there appears to be a probability that inta should be held to be an agency or instrumentality of the republic because the attachment orders must be vacated due to a lack of commercial activity in the united states the court does not decide this issue the republic and basfs additional arguments the republic and basf have made additional arguments supporting their motions to vacate the attachment orders the republic argues that the attachment orders are overbroad and the republic and basf urge the court to vacate the patent attachment order because of the possible effects on the rights of third parties including basf however because the attachment order should be vacated on the other grounds discussed above the court does not reach these further arguments conclusion the court grants defendants and basfs motions to vacate the attachment orders the court denies plaintiffs motions to confirm the attachment orders this opinion resolves the motions listed as document numbers
