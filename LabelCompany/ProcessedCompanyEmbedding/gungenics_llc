has recently released their patentpending quikchange system gun cleaning kit the quikchange system is designed with a quick attach quick disconnect locking mechanism on each of the cleaning components contrary to traditional threaded components the gungenics quikchange system is a simple pushpull on and off design gungenics was at shot show  and have sent us a pistol cleaning kit for us to review” …read more from  shot show all outdoors “one of the more interesting firearms accessories i saw at the  shot show was the line of firearms cleaning kits by gungenics these cleaning rods incorporate several innovate features designed to make gun cleaning easier including color coded rods made of glassreinforced nylon i was especially impressed by their  rimfire cleaning rod and brush that was noticeably easier to push through the bore than a traditional cleaning kit” …read more from the arms guide “gungenics has come out with a quikchange gun cleaning system that will simplify your life at least when it comes to cleaning your guns most of us who have been shooting for awhile have a cleaning box filled with a rats nest of rods and brushes in a mess that makes finding the right size equipment a challenge throw that mess out and replace it with caliber color coded goodness that cleans great and takes very little space” …read more from double tap   from gunsamerica “enter gungenics at first glance i thought “oh look another gimmick for gun cleaning” – but on closer examination i became more than just a little interested what caught my attention were two key elements of the gungenics system the rod and all nonbrush parts are glassreinforced nylon and the shaft uses a quickconnectdisconnect or “quickchange” system for the brushes jags and other attachments i like the nylon components because i hate to hear metal on metal when i’m cleaning my guns even when it is brass or aluminum which i know is softer than the case hardened steel of the pistol it still irritates me to hear them scrape the idea of the quickchange system means i don’t have to fumble around with screwin parts with oily or grimy fingers” …read more from american handgunner “the gungenics system is brand new it’s basically a “quick change” cleaning rod and brushes and jags color coded to match different calibers you clean the gun using the cleaners you like but the bayonettype quick change mount of the gungenics accessories allows you to bop back and forth between brushes and jags in a snap the glassreinforced nylon construction won’t harm your gun either it all actually works great” …read more from all outdoor “the gungenics cleaning system should go a long way towards alleviating these woes each of their attachments connects to their cleaning rod without using threads and can be quickly and easily inserted or removed just align the attachment properly and shove it into the rod and you’re done to remove it press a little lever on the rod and the attachment will come right out another nice touch color matched calibers you need a bore brush and a patch jag for each caliber and gungenics uses the same color polymer for that job for instance both the mm brush and jag have blue stems” …read more from armed and feminine our companyabout us user guide policies our productsquikchange gun cleaning kits caliber specific bore brushes all products product reviews
