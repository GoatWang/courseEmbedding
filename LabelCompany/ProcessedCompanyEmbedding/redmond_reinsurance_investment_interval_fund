investment purposes in ils redmond capital is the funds investment adviser in selecting ils for investment redmond capital considers their relative return potential in light of their expected relative risk using quantitative and qualitative analysis through proprietary and thirdparty models redmond capitals analysis may consider various factors such as expected loss probability of occurrence or loss trigger type measurement of loss event specific to an instrument or other terms of an instrument as well as model accuracy redmond capitals analysis also may guide it in determining the desired allocation of ils by issuer peril and geographic exposure redmond capital may rely upon information and analysis obtained from related parties brokers dealers and ratings organizations among other sources in selecting investments other than ils redmond capital considers both broad economic and issuerspecific factors redmond capital selects individual securities based upon the terms of the securities liquidity and rating sector and exposure to particular issuers and sectors redmond capital may sell a portfolio security when it believes the security no longer will contribute to meeting the funds investment objective redmond capital makes that determination based on the same criteria it uses to select portfolio securities portfolio investments under normal circumstances the fund invests at least  of its net assets plus the amount of borrowings if any for investment purposes in ils derivative instruments that provide exposure to such ils or have similar economic characteristics may be used to satisfy the funds  policy ils may include eventlinked bonds also known as catastrophe or cat bonds structured reinsurance investments including but not limited

companies that invest primarily in reinsurancerelated securities securities of companies in the insurance or reinsurance industries and other insurance and reinsurancerelated securities ils are typically highyield or below investmentgrade commonly referred to as junk bonds accordingly a significant portion of the funds portfolio will be invested in highyield highrisk debt securities highyield securities typically are of below investment grade quality and have below investment grade credit ratings which ratings are associated with securities having highrisk speculative characteristics highyield securities may also include securities that are not rated the adviser has broad discretion to allocate the funds assets among these investment categories the fund may invest in ils across the highyield spectrum but will generally focus its investments in higheryielding higherrisk securities within the below investmentgrade category the fund has no limit as to the maturity of the securities in which it invests or as to the market capitalization of the issuer to the extent consistent with the repurchase liquidity requirement of an interval fund the fund may invest without limitation in illiquid securities    in addition to ils the fund may invest in in a broad range of issuers and segments of the debt securities market debt securities may include instruments and obligations of us and nonus corporate and other nongovernmental entities those of us and nonus governmental entities including government agencies and instrumentalities floating rate loans and other floating rate securities subordinated debt securities certificates of deposit money market securities funds that invest primarily in debt securities and cash cash equivalents and other short term holdings the funds investments may have fixed or variable principal payments and all types of interest rate and dividend payment and reset terms including fixed rate adjustable rate floating rate contingent deferred payment in kind and auction rate features the funds investments may include instruments that allow for balloon payments or negative amortization payments the fund may invest in ils issued by nonus issuers the fund may but is not required to use derivatives such as currency forward contracts and bond and interest rate futures the fund may use derivatives for a variety of purposes including in an attempt to hedge against adverse changes in the market price of securities interest rates or currency exchange rates as a substitute for purchasing or selling securities to seek eventlinked exposure to attempt to increase the funds return as a nonhedging strategy that may be considered speculative and to manage portfolio characteristics the fund may choose not to make use of derivatives for a variety of reasons and any use may be limited by applicable law and regulations the fund also may hold cash or other shortterm investments to the extent consistent with the repurchase liquidity requirement of an interval fund the fund may invest without limit in illiquid securities eventlinked bonds the fund may invest in eventlinked bonds which sometimes are referred to as insurancelinked catastrophe or cat bonds eventlinked bonds are typically floating rate debt securities for which the return of principal and payment of interest are contingent on the nonoccurrence of a specified trigger events such as an earthquake or hurricane of a particular intensity the fund may invest in eventlinked bonds in one or more of three primary ways the fund may purchase eventlinked bonds when initially offered the fund may purchase eventlinked bonds in the secondary overthecounter market or the fund may gain indirect exposure to eventlinked bonds using derivatives such as eventlinked swaps eventlinked swaps are derivative instruments that are typically contingent or formulaically related to defined trigger events eventlinked bonds may be issued by government agencies insurance companies reinsurers special purpose corporations or other us or nonus entities eventlinked bonds are often rated by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating agency but also may be unrated the rating for an eventlinked bond primarily reflects the rating agencys calculated probability that a trigger event will occur this rating also assesses the eventlinked bonds credit risk and the model used to calculate the probability of a trigger event trigger events can include natural events eg hurricanes earthquakes and weatherrelated phenomena and nonnatural events eg large aviation or marine events trigger events are typically defined by three criteria the occurrence of a predefined event a geographic area in which the event must occur and the exceedance of a threshold of economic or physical loss by a company or industry sector physical parameters that define the event such as earthquake magnitude or hurricane wind speed or modeled values based on a combination of the preceding factors in order for a trigger event to be deemed to have occurred in most cases each of the three criteria must be satisfied while the bond is outstanding the fund may invest in other types of eventlinked bonds where the trigger event may be based on companywide losses indemnity triggers indexbased losses index triggers or a combination of triggers hybrid triggers indemnity triggers indemnity triggers are typically based on losses of the insurance company or other entity issuing the eventlinked bond the trigger event would be considered to have occurred if a companys losses on catastrophic insurance claims exceeded a certain aggregate amount if the companys losses were less than the predetermined aggregate amount the trigger event would not be considered to have occurred and the fund would be entitled to recover its principal plus any accrued but unpaid interest indemnity triggers require    investors and rating agencies to understand the risks of the insurance and reinsurance policies underwritten by the company which may be difficult to obtain and assess particularly in the case of complex commercial insurance and reinsurance policies in addition eventlinked bond investors are dependent upon the companys ability to settle catastrophe claims in a manner that would not be disadvantageous to investors interests index triggers index triggers typically use one of three broad approaches parametric industry loss or modeled loss index triggers generally use predefined formulas to calculate principal loss which minimizes risks relating to an individual companys insurance claimshandling practices and other companyspecific business practices index triggers do expose the investor to other risks such as delay in or failure to report index values accurately or on a timely basis parametric parametric index triggers are based upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event in a certain geographic location with predefined physical characteristics such as earthquake magnitude or hurricane wind speed industry loss industry loss index triggers are often based upon the estimated loss from a catastrophic event for the insurance industry as a whole or for a specific subsector estimates are derived from a thirdparty reporting service such as property claim services or perils modeled loss modeled loss index triggers typically take the physical parameters that define a catastrophic event such as geographic location and intensity and apply them to a predefined portfolio of notional risks using a thirdparty catastrophe model to calculate an index value that approximates the damage caused by the event hybrid triggers hybrid triggers use more than one trigger type to determine the potential principal reduction of an eventlinked bond for example a hybrid trigger could require the occurrence of both a us hurricane and a japanese earthquake each with different trigger values within a given time period in order for principal reduction to occur another example of a hybrid trigger would be for a us hurricane to occur with winds that exceeded a certain value in a given geographic location a parametric trigger that also caused us insured property losses to exceed a certain value an industry loss trigger before an eventlinked bond could start losing principal the fund has no limit as to the types of events geographic areas or thresholds of loss referenced by eventlinked bonds in which it can invest generally the event is either a natural or nonnatural peril of a kind that results in significant physical or economic loss natural perils include disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes windstorms fires and floods nonnatural perils include disasters resulting from human activity such as commercial and industrial accidents or business interruptions structured reinsurance investments the fund may invest in special purpose vehicles spvs or similar instruments structured to comprise a portion of a reinsurers catastropheoriented business including but not limited to quota share instruments sometimes referred to as reinsurance sidecars or to provide reinsurance relating to specific risks to insurance or reinsurance companies through a collateralized instrument sometimes known as collateralized reinsurance quota share instruments and other structured reinsurance investments generally will be considered illiquid securities by the fund the fund may invest substantially in illiquid securities structured reinsurance investments developed along with eventlinked bonds as a mechanism to facilitate risktransfer from insurance markets to capital markets investors these instruments are typically more customizable but less liquid investments than eventlinked bonds like some eventlinked bonds an investor in structured reinsurance investments participates in the premiums and losses associated with underlying reinsurance contracts where the instruments are based on the performance of underlying reinsurance contracts the fund has limited transparency into the underlying insurance policies and therefore must rely upon the risk assessment and underwriting practices of the reinsurance company counterparty the instruments typically mature in one year    the fund may invest indirectly in reinsurance contracts by holding notes or preferred shares issued by a spv whose performance is tied to an underlying reinsurance transaction including structured reinsurance investments such as quota share instruments quota share instruments are a form of proportional reinsurance in which an investor participates in the premiums and losses of a reinsurers portfolio of catastropheoriented policies according to a predefined percentage for example under a  quota share agreement the spv would be entitled to  of all premiums associated with a defined portfolio and be responsible for  of all related claims collateralized reinsurance investments are privately structured securities or derivatives utilized to gain exposure to the reinsurance market collateralized reinsurance involves an spv entering into a reinsurance arrangement that is then collateralized by invested capital and premiums related to the insurance coverage the collateral is designed to cover in full the potential claims that could arise from the underlying reinsurance contract structured reinsurance investments may include eventlinked swaps such as industry loss warranties ilws ilws are insurancelinked securities used to finance peak nonrecurrent insurance risks such as hurricanes tropical storms and earthquakes ilws feature an industry loss index trigger and in some cases a dual trigger design that includes a protection buyer indemnity trigger a traditional ilw takes the form of a bilateral reinsurance contract but there are also index products that take the form of derivatives collateralized structures or exchange traded instruments an eventlinked swap may also use any of the trigger mechanisms discussed in eventlinked bonds the common feature among these forms is that the principal reduction mechanism is based on an index trigger investment companies the fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies that invest primarily in ils which can include openend funds closedend funds limited partnerships unit investment trusts and business development companies the fund may invest in exchangetraded funds etfs which are typically openend funds or unit investment trusts listed on a stock exchange one reason the fund might do so is to gain exposure to segments of the markets represented by another fund at times when the fund might not be able to buy the particular type of securities directly as a shareholder of an investment company the fund would be subject to its ratable share of that investment companys expenses including its advisory and administration expenses the fund does not intend to invest in other investment companies unless the adviser believes that the potential benefits of the investment justify the payment of any premiums or sales charges the funds investments in the securities of other investment companies are subject to the limitations that apply to those types of investments under the investment company act of  as amended the  act other pooled investment vehicles the fund may invest in the interests of pooled investment vehicles not subject to registration under the  act that invest primarily in ils such interests may have limited or no liquidity and the transfer of such interests may be restricted there can be no assurance of a ready market for resale the fund could find it difficult to sell privately placed securities and other restricted securities when the adviser believes it is desirable to do so especially under adverse market or economic conditions or in the event of adverse changes in the financial condition of the issuer and the prices realized could be less than those originally paid or less than the fair market value at times it also may be difficult to determine the fair value of such securities for purposes of computing the nav of the fund as an investor in such a pooled investment vehicle the fund would be subject to its ratable share of such investment vehicles expenses and fees including management fees and performancerelated fees the fund does not intend to invest in other pooled investment vehicles unless the adviser believes that the potential benefits of the investment justify the payment of the expenses and fees charged by such pooled investment vehicle in implementing the funds investment strategy redmond capital will seek to limit the funds exposure to any single catastrophic event by investing in ils tied to a varied group of available perils and geographic regions further within each region and peril redmond capital seeks to hold a balance of exposures to underlying    insurance and reinsurance carriers trigger types and lines of business redmond capital will continue to monitor the risk of the funds investments on a regular basis much of the ils in which the fund invest may be issued by nonus issuers as a result the fund may invest substantially in securities issued by foreign sovereigns or by us or foreign entities that are corporations partnerships trusts or other types of business entities under normal circumstances the fund intends to invest substantially all its assets in ils but retains the flexibility to invest at times in other securities including us government securities cash and cash equivalents leverage the fund may obtain leverage through borrowings in seeking its investment objective the funds borrowings which would be in the form of loans from banks may be on a secured or unsecured basis and at fixed or variable rates of interest the funds ability to obtain leverage through borrowings is dependent upon its ability to establish and maintain an appropriate line of credit the  act requires the fund to maintain continuous asset coverage of not less than  with respect to all borrowings this means that the value of the funds total indebtedness may not exceed onethird of the value of its total assets including such indebtedness measured at the time the fund incurs the indebtedness investment adviser redmond capital is the investment adviser of the fund redmond capital is a newly formed investment adviser and as of               redmond capital had no assets under management peter h vloedman the funds portfolio manager is primarily responsible for the daytoday management of the fund

reinvested in shares of the fund distributor transfer agent administrator and custodian alps denver colorado is the funds distributor alps fund services inc afs denver colorado serves as the

custodian the fund compensates the distributor administrator and accounting agent transfer agent and custodian for their services unlisted closedend fund structure limited liquidity the fund does not currently intend to list its shares for trading on any securities exchange and does not expect any secondary market to develop for its shares shareholders of the fund are not able to have their shares redeemed or otherwise sell their shares on a daily basis because the fund is an unlisted closedend fund in order to try to provide liquidity to shareholders the fund is structured as an interval fund and conducts periodic repurchase offers for a portion of its outstanding shares as described herein an investment in the fund is suitable only for longterm investors who can bear the risks associated with the limited liquidity of the shares special risk considerations an investment in the fund involves special risk considerations you should consider carefully the risks summarized below which are described in more detail under risk considerations beginning on page      of this prospectus    the fund is generally sold to i registered investment advisers rias that meet certain qualifications ii clients of such rias and iii certain other eligible investors the minimum initial account size is  million subject to certain exceptions see investment minimums investors should carefully consider the funds risks and investment objectives as an investment in the fund may not be appropriate for all investors and is not designed to be a complete investment program an investment in the fund involves a high degree of risk ils in which the fund invests are considered highyield securities or junk bonds it is possible that investing in the fund may result in a loss of some or all of the amount invested before making an investmentallocation decision investors should i consider the suitability of this investment with respect to an investors or a clients investment objectives and individual situation and ii consider factors such as an investors or a clients net worth income age and risk tolerance investment should be avoided where an investorclient has a shortterm investing horizon andor cannot bear the loss of some or all of their investment no prior history the fund is a newly organized closedend management investment company with no history of operations and thus has no financial statements or other meaningful operating or financial data on which potential investors may evaluate the fund and its performance and is designed for longterm investors and not as a trading vehicle ils risks the principal risk of an investment in an ils is that a trigger events eg i natural events such as a hurricane tornado or earthquake of a particular sizemagnitude in a designated geographic area or ii nonnatural events such as large aviation disasters will occur and the fund will lose all or a significant portion of the principal it has invested in the security and right to additional interest payments with respect to the security if multiple trigger events occur that impact a significant portion of the securities held by the fund the fund could suffer substantial losses and an investor will lose money a majority of the funds assets will be invested in ils tied to natural events and other nonnatural catastrophes and there is inherent uncertainty as to whether when or where such events will occur there is no way to predict whether a trigger event will occur and because of this significant uncertainty ils carry a high degree of risk eventlinked bonds the return of principal and the payment of interest on eventlinked bonds are contingent on the nonoccurrence of a predefined trigger event such as a hurricane or an earthquake of a specific magnitude or other event that leads to physical or economic loss if a trigger event as defined within the terms of an eventlinked bond involves losses or other metrics exceeding a specific magnitude in the geographic region and time period specified therein the fund may lose a portion or all of its accrued interest andor principal invested in such eventlinked bond in addition to the specified trigger events eventlinked bonds may expose the fund to other risks including but not limited to issuer credit default adverse regulatory or jurisdictional interpretations and adverse tax consequences eventlinked bonds are also subject to the risk that the model used to calculate the probability of a trigger event was not accurate and underestimated the likelihood of a trigger event ils may provide for extensions of maturity in order to process and audit loss claims in those cases when a trigger event has or possibly has occurred upon the occurrence or possible occurrence of a trigger event and until the completion of the processing and auditing of applicable loss claims the funds investment in an eventlinked bond may be priced using fair value methods lack of a liquid market may impose the risk of higher transaction costs and the possibility that the fund may be forced to liquidate positions when it would not be advantageous to do so structured reinsurance investments the fund may invest in spvs or similar instruments structured to comprise a portion of a reinsurers catastropheoriented business including but not limited to quota share instruments sometimes referred to as reinsurance sidecars or to provide reinsurance relating to specific risks to insurance or reinsurance companies through a collateralized instrument known as collateralized reinsurance quota shares instruments and other structured reinsurance investments generally will be considered illiquid securities by the fund    structured reinsurance investments are typically more customizable but less liquid investments than eventlinked bonds like eventlinked bonds an investor in structured reinsurance investments participates in the premiums and losses associated with underlying reinsurance contracts structured reinsurance investments are subject to the same risks as eventlinked bonds in addition because structure reinsurance investments such as quota share instruments represent an interest in a basket of underlying reinsurance contracts the fund has limited transparency into the individual underlying contracts and therefore must rely upon the risk assessment and sound underwriting practices of the reinsurance company counterparty accordingly it may be more difficult for the adviser to fully evaluate the underlying risk profile of such investments and therefore place the funds assets at greater risk of loss than if the adviser had more complete information since ils issuers typically are structured as bankruptcy remote spvs or similar structures it is unlikely that the fund could lose its investment if the applicable trigger event never occurs however there can be no assurance that ils in which the fund may invest in the future will be structured in a similar manner or that a court would uphold the intended bankruptcy remote characterization of the structure if ils issuers are in the future structured in a different manner it may be possible for the fund to lose its entire investment in an eventlinked bond even if the applicable trigger event never occurs catastrophe modeling risk the adviser will generally consider catastrophe risk model analyses whether created by independent third parties the sponsor of an ils a broker or others catastrophe models with respect to the funds investments catastrophe models are designed to assist investors governments and businesses in understanding the potential impact of a wide variety of catastrophic events and allow such parties to analyze the probability of loss in regions with the highest exposure the adviser may use the output of the catastrophe models before and after investment to assist the adviser in assessing the risk of a particular ils or group of such securities a catastrophe model uses insurance scientific and statistical data to estimate the losses that could be sustained due to a catastrophic event but even the most sophisticated models cannot predict actual losses catastrophe models may be used by the adviser as one input in its risk analysis process for fund investments in implementing the funds investment strategy the adviser may obtain the advice of geovera defined below relating to its assessment of the risk of a particular ils or group of such securities geovera employs a dedicated technical risk management and research team that has developed proprietary systems to validate and enhance its use of commercially available products illiquidity and restricted securities risk to the extent consistent with the repurchase liquidity requirement of an interval fund the fund may invest without limitation in illiquid securities liquidity risk is the risk that ils held by the fund may be difficult or impossible to sell at the time that the fund would like or at the price that the fund believes the security is currently worth as a relatively new type of financial instrument there is limited trading history for ils even for those securities deemed to be liquid valuation risk the fund is subject to valuation risk which is the risk that one or more of the securities in which the fund invests are priced incorrectly due to factors such as incomplete data market instability or human error in addition pricing of ils is subject to the added uncertainty caused by the inability to generally predict whether when or where a natural disaster or other trigger event will occur the funds investments in ils for which market quotations are not available will be valued pursuant to procedures adopted by the board moral hazard risk ils are generally subject to one or more types of triggers including socalled indemnitytriggers an indemnity trigger is a trigger based on the actual losses of the ceding sponsor ie the party seeking to diversify its insurance portfolio ils subject to indemnity triggers are often regarded as being subject to potential moral hazard since such ils are triggered by actual losses of the ceding sponsor and the ceding sponsor may have an incentive to take actions andor risks that would have an adverse effect on the fund    ils market and reinvestment risk the size of the ils market may change over time which may limit the availability of ils for investment by the fund the original issuance of ils in general including ils with desired instrument or risk characteristics may fluctuate depending on the capital and capacity needs of reinsurers as well as the demand for ils by investors the availability of ils in the secondary market also may be limited by supply and demand dynamics and prevailing economic conditions to the extent ils held by the fund mature or the fund must sell securities in connection with share repurchases the fund may be required to hold more cash or shortterm instruments than it normally would until attractive ils becomes available holding excess cash andor reinvestment in securities that are lower yielding or less desirable than securities sold may negatively affect performance reinsurance industry risk the performance of ils and the reinsurance industry itself are tied to the occurrence of various triggerevents including weather other natural disasters hurricanes earthquakes etc and other nonnatural catastrophes trigger events are typically defined by three criteria the occurrence of a predefined event a geographic area in which the event must occur and the exceedance of a threshold of economic or physical loss by a company or industry sector physical parameters that define the event such as earthquake magnitude or hurricane wind speed or modeled values based on a combination of the preceding factors generally the event is either a natural or nonnatural peril of a kind that results in significant physical or economic loss natural perils include disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes windstorms fires and floods nonnatural perils include disasters resulting from human activity such as commercial and industrial accidents or business interruptions major disasters in population centers such as los angeles northridge earthquake  or new orleans hurricane katrina  or related to highvalue insured property such as the piper alpha oil rig explosion  can result in significant losses with investors in ils exposed to such events experiencing substantial losses if the frequency and severity of natural and nonnatural disasters increases the risk of significant losses to reinsurers and ils investors may increase floatingrate loan risks a significant percentage of ils in which the fund invests are expected to be variable rate or floating rate eventlinked bonds floating rate loans and similar investments may be illiquid or less liquid than other investments borrowing risk the fund may borrow to meet repurchase requests or for investment purposes ie to purchase additional portfolio securities the funds borrowings which would be in the form of loans from banks may be on a secured or unsecured basis and at fixed or variable rates of interest the funds ability to obtain leverage through borrowings is dependent upon its ability to establish and maintain an appropriate line of credit the cost of borrowing may reduce the funds return leveraging risk the fund may borrow or enter into derivative transactions for investment purposes which will cause the fund to incur investment leverage therefore the fund is subject to leveraging risk leverage magnifies the funds exposure to declines in the value of one or more underlying investments or creates investment risk with respect to a larger pool of assets than the fund would otherwise have this risk is enhanced for the fund because it invests substantially all its assets in ils derivative investments risk the fund may obtain eventlinked exposure by investing in among others eventlinked swaps which typically are contingent or formulaically related to defined trigger events or by pursuing similar eventlinked derivative strategies trigger events include hurricanes earthquakes weatherrelated phenomena and other criteria determined by independent parties if a trigger events occurs the fund may lose the swaps notional amount as derivative instruments eventlinked swaps are subject to risks in addition to the risks of investing in ils including counterparty risk and leverage risk    below investment grade securities risk the fund can invest without limit in ils that are rated below investment grade commonly called junk bonds which are bonds rated below bbb by standard  poors ratings services sp or baa by moodys investors service inc moodys or that have comparable ratings by another rating organization the rating primarily reflects the rating agencys calculated probability that a predefined trigger event will occur therefore securities with a lower rating reflect the rating agencys assessment of the substantial risk that a trigger event will occur and result in a loss the rating also assesses ils credit risk and the model used to calculate the probability of the trigger event the rating system for ils is relatively new and significantly less developed than that of corporate bonds and continues to evolve as the market develops there is no minimum rating on the bonds in which the fund may invest the fund may also invest without limit in ils that are unrated and judged by the adviser to be of below investment grade quality credit and collateral risk ils in which the fund invests will be subject to credit risk the principal invested in an ils may be held by the spv in a collateral account and invested in various permissible assets set forth under the terms of the spv typically the collateral account is invested in highquality us government securities ie us treasury bonds however in certain ils the collateral account may be invested in highyielding higherrisk securities in such instances the fund will be subject to the risk of nonpayment of scheduled principal and interest on such collateral account investments there is no guarantee that the value of the collateral in the collateral account will equal the principal amount of the security either upon the purchase sale or maturity of the ils foreign investing risk the fund may invest in ils issued by foreign sovereigns and foreign entities that are corporations partnerships trusts or other types of business entities because the majority of ils issuers are domiciled outside the united states the fund will normally invest significant amounts of its assets in nonus entities accordingly the fund may invest without limitation in securities issued by nonus entities including those in emerging market countries certain spvs in which the fund invests may be sponsored by nonus ceding insurers that are not subject to the same regulation as that to which us ceding insurers are subject such spvs may pose a greater risk of loss for example due to less stringent underwriting andor riskretention requirements the funds investments will consist primarily of eventlinked bonds and structured reinsurance investments which provide the fund with contractual rights under the terms of the issuance while the contractual rights of eventlinked bonds and structured reinsurance investments issued are similar whether they are issued by a us issuer or a nonus issuer there may be certain additional risks associated with nonus issuers foreign currency risk it is expected that a substantial portion of the funds investments in ils will be us dollar denominated investments to the extent the fund invests in nonus denominated instruments a change in the value of a foreign currency against the us dollar will result in a change in the us dollar value of securities denominated in that foreign currency if the us dollar rises in value against a foreign currency a security denominated in that currency will be worth less in us dollars and if the us dollar decreases in value against a foreign currency a security denominated in that currency will be worth more in us dollars the dollar value of foreign investments may also be affected by exchange controls equity securities risk the fund may at times invest in equity securities the stocks in which the fund invests may be more volatile than the stock market as a whole the value of equity investments and related instruments may decline in response to conditions affecting the general economy overall market changes local regional or global political social or economic instability and currency interest rate and commodity price fluctuations as well as issuer or sector specific events market conditions may affect certain types of stocks to a greater extent than other types of stocks    investment company and other pooled investment vehicle risk investment in investment companies and other pooled investment vehicles typically reflects the risks of the underlying portfolio investments of such investment company or other pooled investment vehicle the funds shareholders bear both their proportionate share of the funds expenses and similar expenses of the investment company or other pooled investment vehicle the price and movement of an etf may not track the underlying index and may result in a loss in addition etfs and closedend funds may trade at a price below their net asset value also known as a discount certain pooled investment vehicles do not have the protections applicable to other types of investments under us federal securities or commodities laws and may be subject to counterparty or credit risk there may be no active market for shares of certain etfs closedend funds or other pooled investment vehicles and such shares may be highly illiquid nondiversification risk the fund is classified as a nondiversified fund under the  act accordingly the fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer than if it were a diversified fund to the extent that the fund invests a higher percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer the fund is more likely to become subject to the risks associated with and developments affecting that issuer than a fund that invests more widely tax risk in order for the fund to qualify for treatment as a regulated investment company ric under subchapter m of chapter  of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code the fund must derive at least  of its gross income each taxable year from qualifying income as described in more detail in the sai meet certain asset diversification tests at the end of each fiscal quarter and distribute at least  of its investment company taxable income ie net investment income and the excess of net shortterm capital gain over net longterm capital loss for each taxable year if in any year the fund fails to qualify as a ric under the code for any reason the fund would be taxed as an ordinary corporation and would become or remain subject to corporate us federal income tax the resulting us federal corporate taxes could substantially reduce the funds net assets the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of distributions such a failure would have a material adverse effect on the fund and its shareholders repurchase offers risk repurchase offers risk is the risk that the funds repurchases of shares may hurt investment performance by forcing the fund to maintain a higher percentage of its assets in liquid investments or to liquidate certain investments when it is not desirable to do so repurchases may be oversubscribed preventing shareholders from selling some or all of their tendered shares back to the fund antitakeover provisions the funds declaration of trust together with any amendments thereto the declaration of trust includes provisions that could limit the ability of other entities or persons to acquire control of the fund or convert the fund to openend status tax considerations you will normally have to pay federal income taxes and any state or local taxes on the dividends and other distributions you receive from the fund for us federal income tax purposes distributions from the funds net capital gains the excess if any of its net longterm capital gains over its net shortterm capital losses are considered longterm capital gains and are generally taxable to noncorporate shareholders at a rate of up to  distributions from the funds net shortterm capital gains are generally taxable as ordinary income other    dividends are generally taxable as ordinary income or in general if paid from the funds qualified dividend income and if certain conditions including holding period requirements are met by the fund and the shareholder as qualified dividend income taxable to individual and certain other noncorporate shareholders at us federal income tax rates of up to  qualified dividend income generally is income derived from dividends paid by us corporations or certain foreign corporations that are either incorporated in a us possession or eligible for tax benefits under certain us income tax treaties in addition dividends that the fund receives in respect of stock of certain foreign corporations may be qualified dividend income if that stock is readily tradable on an established us securities market a portion of dividends received from the fund but none of the funds capital gain distributions may qualify for the dividendsreceived deduction for corporations the fund will report to shareholders annually the us federal income tax status of all fund distributions if the fund declares a dividend in october november or december payable to shareholders of record in such a month and pays it in january of the following year you will be taxed on the dividend as if you received it in the year in which it was declared you should consult a tax adviser about state local and foreign taxes on your distributions from the fund see federal income tax matters and dividends reinvestment plan    summary of fund expenses the following table describes the fees and expenses you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the fund   shareholder transaction

organizational expenses for the fund are estimated to be              and assuming an offering of                           shares total offering costs are estimated to be               the fund does not currently charge a repurchase fee however the fund may charge a repurchase fee of up to  which the fund would retain to help offset nonde minimis estimated costs related to the repurchase  other expenses are based on estimated amounts for the current fiscal year  to the extent the fund invests in other investment companies acquired funds the funds shareholders indirectly bear a pro rata portion of the fees and expenses of such acquired funds based on the anticipated net proceeds of present offering the fund expects acquired fund fees and expenses to amount to less than  of average net assets of the fund for the current fiscal year acquired fund fees and expenses are included in other expenses  the adviser and the fund have entered into an expense limitation agreement under which the adviser has agreed contractually to waive its fees and to pay or absorb the ordinary annual operating expenses of the fund including organizational and offering expenses but excluding interest taxes brokerage commissions borrowing and other investmentrelated costs and fees acquired fund fees and expenses and extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of the funds business to the extent that they exceed  per annum of the funds average daily net assets the expense limitation if the fund incurs expenses excluded from the expense limitation agreement the funds expense ratio could exceed that amount in consideration of the advisers agreement to limit the funds expenses the fund has agreed to repay the adviser in the amount of any fees waived and fund expenses paid or absorbed subject to the limitations that  the reimbursement for fees and expenses will be made only if payable not more than three years from the end of the fiscal year in which they were incurred and  the reimbursement may not be made if it would cause the expense limitation as of the time of waiver to be exceeded the expense limitation agreement will remain in effect at least until               unless and until the board approves its modification or termination this agreement may be terminated only by the board on  days written notice to the adviser see management of the fund example the following example is intended to help you understand the various costs and expenses that you as a holder of shares would bear directly or indirectly the example assumes that you invest  in shares of the fund for the time periods indicated because there are no costs associated with repurchases your costs would be the same whether you hold your shares or tender your shares for repurchase at the end of the time periods indicated the example also assumes that your investment has a  return each year that all dividends and    distributions are reinvested at nav and that the funds operating expenses as described above remain the same although your actual costs may be higher or lower based on these assumptions your costs would be    year    years     financial highlights the fund is newly organized and its shares have not previously been offered and therefore the fund does not have any financial history additional information about the funds investments will be available in the funds annual and semiannual reports when they are prepared the fund the fund is a newly organized nondiversified closedend management investment company registered under the  act the fund was organized as a delaware statutory trust pursuant to a certificate of trust filed with the secretary of state of the state of delaware on march   the fund has no operating history the funds principal office is located at  east lancaster avenue suite  wayne pa  use of proceeds the fund will invest the proceeds of the offering of shares in accordance with its investment objective and policies as stated below it is presently anticipated that the fund will be able to fully invest the net proceeds according to its investment objective and policies within approximately      months after receipt of the proceeds depending on the amount and timing of proceeds available to the fund as well as the availability of securities consistent with the funds investment objective and strategies pending investment of the net proceeds the fund will invest in highquality shortterm debt securities cash andor cash equivalents investment objective and policies investment objective the funds investment objective is total return there can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objective the funds investment objective may be changed without shareholder approval the fund will provide notice prior to implementing any change to its investment objective redmond capital believes that investment in ils should involve a longterm view and a systematic focus on sources of expected return not on security selection or market timing in constructing an investment portfolio the adviser identifies a universe of eligible securities with predefined risk and return characteristics it then seeks to approximate the characteristics of that universe while efficiently managing the portfolio and trading costs because the event risks in ilslargely related to natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanesare not similar to the risks investors bear in traditional equity and debt markets the adviser believes that investment in ils may provide benefits when added to traditional asset portfolios as such the adviser does not intend to buy or sell securities for the portfolio based on prospects for the economy or based on movements of traditional equity and debt markets principal investment strategies the fund will pursue its investment objective by investing primarily in ils ils may include eventlinked bonds also known as catastrophe or cat bonds structured reinsurance investments including but not limited to quota    share instruments also known as reinsurance sidecars collateralized reinsurance investments and eventlinked swaps interests in pooled investment vehicles including registered investment companies that invest primarily in reinsurancerelated securities securities of companies in the insurance or reinsurance industries and other insurance and reinsurancerelated securities under normal circumstances the fund will invest at least  of its net assets plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes in ils redmond capital is the funds investment adviser in selecting ils for investment redmond capital considers their relative return potential in light of their expected relative risk using quantitative and qualitative analysis through proprietary and thirdparty models redmond capitals analysis may consider various factors such as expected loss probability of occurrence or loss trigger type measurement of loss event specific to an instrument or other terms of an instrument as well as model accuracy redmond capitals analysis also may guide it in determining the desired allocation of ils by issuer peril and geographic exposure redmond capital may rely upon information and analysis obtained from related parties brokers dealers and ratings organizations among other sources in selecting investments other than ils redmond capital considers both broad economic and issuerspecific factors redmond capital selects individual securities based upon the terms of the securities liquidity and rating sector and exposure to particular issuers and sectors redmond capital may sell a portfolio security when it believes the security no longer will contribute to meeting the funds investment objective redmond capital makes that determination based on the same criteria it uses to select portfolio securities portfolio investments under normal circumstances the fund invests at least  of its net assets plus the amount of borrowings if any for investment purposes in ils derivative instruments that provide exposure to such ils or have similar economic characteristics may be used to satisfy the funds  policy ils may include eventlinked bonds also known as catastrophe or cat bonds structured reinsurance investments including but not limited to quota share instruments also known as reinsurance sidecars collateralized reinsurance investments and eventlinked swaps interests in pooled investment vehicles including registered investment companies that invest primarily in reinsurancerelated securities securities of companies in the insurance or reinsurance industries and other insurance and reinsurancerelated securities ils are typically highyield or below investmentgrade commonly referred to as junk bonds accordingly a significant portion of the funds portfolio will be invested in highyield highrisk debt securities highyield securities typically are of below investment grade quality and have below investment grade credit ratings which ratings are associated with securities having highrisk speculative characteristics highyield securities may also include securities that are not rated the adviser has broad discretion to allocate the funds assets among these investment categories the fund may invest in ils across the highyield spectrum but will generally focus its investments in higheryielding higherrisk securities within the below investmentgrade category the fund has no limit as to the maturity of the securities in which it invests or as to the market capitalization of the issuer to the extent consistent with the repurchase liquidity requirement of an interval fund the fund may invest without limitation in illiquid securities in addition to ils the fund may invest in in a broad range of issuers and segments of the debt securities market debt securities may include instruments and obligations of us and nonus corporate and other nongovernmental entities those of us and nonus governmental entities including government agencies and instrumentalities floating rate loans and other floating rate securities subordinated debt securities certificates of deposit money market securities funds that invest primarily in debt securities and cash cash equivalents and other short term holdings the funds investments may have fixed or variable principal payments and all types of interest rate and dividend payment and reset terms including fixed rate adjustable rate floating rate contingent deferred payment in kind and auction rate features the funds investments may include instruments that allow for balloon payments or negative amortization payments the fund may invest in ils issued by nonus issuers the fund may but is not required to use derivatives such as currency forward contracts and bond and interest rate futures the fund may use derivatives for a variety of purposes including in an attempt to hedge against    adverse changes in the market price of securities interest rates or currency exchange rates as a substitute for purchasing or selling securities to seek eventlinked exposure to attempt to increase the funds return as a nonhedging strategy that may be considered speculative and to manage portfolio characteristics the fund may choose not to make use of derivatives for a variety of reasons and any use may be limited by applicable law and regulations the fund also may hold cash or other shortterm investments to the extent consistent with the repurchase liquidity requirement of an interval fund the fund may invest without limit in illiquid securities the funds policy of investing  its net assets plus the amount of borrowings if any for investment purposes in ils may only be changed by the board following  days prior written notice to shareholders ils the fund intends to invest substantially all of its assets in ils including eventlinked bonds also known as catastrophe or cat bonds structured reinsurance investments including but not limited to quota share instruments also known as reinsurance sidecars collateralized reinsurance investments and eventlinked swaps interests in pooled investment vehicles including registered investment companies that invest primarily in reinsurancerelated securities securities of companies in the insurance or reinsurance industries and other insurance and reinsurancerelated securities eventlinked bonds the fund may invest in eventlinked bonds which sometimes are referred to as insurancelinked catastrophe or cat bonds eventlinked bonds are typically floating rate debt securities for which the return of principal and payment of interest are contingent on the nonoccurrence of a specified trigger events such as an earthquake or hurricane of a particular intensity the fund may invest in eventlinked bonds in one or more of three primary ways the fund may purchase eventlinked bonds when initially offered the fund may purchase eventlinked bonds in the secondary overthecounter market or the fund may gain indirect exposure to eventlinked bonds using derivatives such as eventlinked swaps eventlinked swaps are derivative instruments that are typically contingent or formulaically related to defined trigger events eventlinked bonds may be issued by government agencies insurance companies reinsurers special purpose corporations or other us or nonus entities eventlinked bonds are often rated by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating agency but also may be unrated the rating for an eventlinked bond primarily reflects the rating agencys calculated probability that a trigger event will occur this rating also assesses the eventlinked bonds credit risk and the model used to calculate the probability of a trigger event trigger events can include natural events eg hurricanes earthquakes and weatherrelated phenomena and nonnatural events eg large aviation or marine events trigger events are typically defined by three criteria the occurrence of a predefined event a geographic area in which the event must occur and the exceedance of a threshold of economic or physical loss by a company or industry sector physical parameters that define the event such as earthquake magnitude or hurricane wind speed or modeled values based on a combination of the preceding factors in order for a trigger event to be deemed to have occurred in most cases each of the three criteria must be satisfied while the bond is outstanding the fund may invest in other types of eventlinked bonds where the trigger event may be based on companywide losses indemnity triggers indexbased losses index triggers or a combination of triggers hybrid triggers indemnity triggers indemnity triggers are typically based on losses of the insurance company or other entity issuing the eventlinked bond the trigger event would be considered to have occurred if a companys losses on catastrophic insurance claims exceeded a certain aggregate amount if the companys losses were less than the predetermined aggregate amount the trigger event would not be considered to have occurred and the fund would be entitled to recover its principal plus any accrued but unpaid interest indemnity triggers require investors and rating agencies to understand the risks of the insurance and reinsurance policies underwritten by the    company which may be difficult to obtain and assess particularly in the case of complex commercial insurance and reinsurance policies in addition eventlinked bond investors are dependent upon the companys ability to settle catastrophe claims in a manner that would not be disadvantageous to investors interests index triggers index triggers typically use one of three broad approaches parametric industry loss or modeled loss index triggers generally use predefined formulas to calculate principal loss which minimizes risks relating to an individual companys insurance claimshandling practices and other companyspecific business practices index triggers do expose the investor to other risks such as delay in or failure to report index values accurately or on a timely basis parametric parametric index triggers are based upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event in a certain geographic location with predefined physical characteristics such as earthquake magnitude or hurricane wind speed industry loss industry loss index triggers are often based upon the estimated loss from a catastrophic event for the insurance industry as a whole or for a specific subsector estimates are derived from a thirdparty reporting service such as property claim services or perils modeled loss modeled loss index triggers typically take the physical parameters that define a catastrophic event such as geographic location and intensity and apply them to a predefined portfolio of notional risks using a thirdparty catastrophe model to calculate an index value that approximates the damage caused by the event hybrid triggers hybrid triggers use more than one trigger type to determine the potential principal reduction of an eventlinked bond for example a hybrid trigger could require the occurrence of both a us hurricane and a japanese earthquake each with different trigger values within a given time period in order for principal reduction to occur another example of a hybrid trigger would be for a us hurricane to occur with winds that exceeded a certain value in a given geographic location a parametric trigger that also caused us insured property losses to exceed a certain value an industry loss trigger before an eventlinked bond could start losing principal the fund has no limit as to the types of events geographic areas or thresholds of loss referenced by eventlinked bonds in which it can invest generally the event is either a natural or nonnatural peril of a kind that results in significant physical or economic loss natural perils include disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes windstorms fires and floods nonnatural perils include disasters resulting from human activity such as commercial and industrial accidents or business interruptions structured reinsurance investments the fund may invest in spvs or similar instruments structured to comprise a portion of a reinsurers catastropheoriented business including but not limited to quota share instruments sometimes referred to as reinsurance sidecars or to provide reinsurance relating to specific risks to insurance or reinsurance companies through a collateralized instrument sometimes known as collateralized reinsurance quota share instruments and other structured reinsurance investments generally will be considered illiquid securities by the fund the fund may invest substantially in illiquid securities structured reinsurance investments developed along with eventlinked bonds as a mechanism to facilitate risktransfer from insurance markets to capital markets investors these instruments are typically more customizable but less liquid investments than eventlinked bonds like some eventlinked bonds an investor in structured reinsurance investments participates in the premiums and losses associated with underlying reinsurance contracts where the instruments are based on the performance of underlying reinsurance contracts the fund has limited transparency into the underlying insurance policies and therefore must rely upon the risk assessment and underwriting practices of the reinsurance company counterparty the instruments typically mature in one year    the fund may invest indirectly in reinsurance contracts by holding notes or preferred shares issued by a spv whose performance is tied to an underlying reinsurance transaction including structured reinsurance investments such as quota share instruments quota share instruments are a form of proportional reinsurance in which an investor participates in the premiums and losses of a reinsurers portfolio of catastropheoriented policies according to a predefined percentage for example under a  quota share agreement the spv would be entitled to  of all premiums associated with a defined portfolio and be responsible for  of all related claims collateralized reinsurance investments are privately structured securities or derivatives utilized to gain exposure to the reinsurance market collateralized reinsurance involves an spv entering into a reinsurance arrangement that is then collateralized by invested capital and premiums related to the insurance coverage the collateral is designed to cover in full the potential claims that could arise from the underlying reinsurance contract structured reinsurance investments may include eventlinked swaps such as ilws ilws are insurancelinked securities used to finance peak nonrecurrent insurance risks such as hurricanes tropical storms and earthquakes ilws feature an industry loss index trigger and in some cases a dual trigger design that includes a protection buyer indemnity trigger a traditional ilw takes the form of a bilateral reinsurance contract but there are also index products that take the form of derivatives collateralized structures or exchange traded instruments an eventlinked swap may also use any of the trigger mechanisms discussed in eventlinked bonds the common feature among these forms is that the principal reduction mechanism is based on an index trigger investment companies the fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies that invest primarily in ils which can include openend funds closedend funds limited partnerships unit investment trusts and business development companies the fund may invest in exchangetraded funds etfs which are typically openend funds or unit investment trusts listed on a stock exchange one reason the fund might do so is to gain exposure to segments of the markets represented by another fund at times when the fund might not be able to buy the particular type of securities directly as a shareholder of an investment company the fund would be subject to its ratable share of that investment companys expenses including its advisory and administration expenses the fund does not intend to invest in other investment companies unless the adviser believes that the potential benefits of the investment justify the payment of any premiums or sales charges the funds investments in the securities of other investment companies are subject to the limitations that apply to those types of investments under  act other pooled investment vehicles the fund may invest in the interests of pooled investment vehicles not subject to registration under the  act that invest primarily in ils such interests may have limited or no liquidity and the transfer of such interests may be restricted there can be no assurance of a ready market for resale the fund could find it difficult to sell privately placed securities and other restricted securities when the adviser believes it is desirable to do so especially under adverse market or economic conditions or in the event of adverse changes in the financial condition of the issuer and the prices realized could be less than those originally paid or less than the fair market value at times it also may be difficult to determine the fair value of such securities for purposes of computing the nav of the fund as an investor in such a pooled investment vehicle the fund would be subject to its ratable share of such investment vehicles expenses and fees including management fees and performancerelated fees the fund does not intend to invest in other pooled investment vehicles unless the adviser believes that the potential benefits of the investment justify the payment of the expenses and fees charged by such pooled investment vehicle in implementing the funds investment strategy redmond capital will seek to limit the funds exposure to any single catastrophic event by investing in ils tied to a varied group of available perils and geographic regions further within each region and peril redmond capital seeks to hold a balance of exposures to underlying insurance and reinsurance carriers trigger types and lines of business redmond capital will continue to monitor the risk of the funds investments on a regular basis    much of the ils in which the fund invest may be issued by nonus issuers as a result the fund may invest substantially in securities issued by foreign sovereigns or by us or foreign entities that are corporations partnerships trusts or other types of business entities under normal circumstances the fund intends to invest substantially all its assets in ils but retains the flexibility to invest at times in other securities including us government securities cash and cash equivalents liquidity and restricted securities the eventlinked bonds and structured reinsurance investments in which the fund will invest are restricted securities in that they are legally restricted as to resale pursuant to section a of the securities act of  as amended the  act and securities eligible for resale pursuant to rule a thereunder certain section a and rule a securities may be treated as liquid securities if the board determines that such treatment is warranted and most or all of the eventlinked bonds in which the fund invests will be considered liquid securities even if determined to be liquid holdings of rule a securities may increase the level of fund illiquidity if eligible buyers become uninterested in purchasing them structured reinsurance investments generally will be considered illiquid securities by the fund the fund may invest substantially in illiquid securities below investment grade securities because most ils are rated below investment grade or unrated a substantial portion of the funds assets may be invested in below investment grade bonds similar in some respects to highyield corporate bond funds eventlinked bonds and structured reinsurance investments are exposed to catastrophic insurance risk whereas highyield bonds are typically exposed to the potential default of financially distressed issuers the fund has no limit as to the maturity of the securities in which it invests or as to the market capitalization of the issuer the fund may invest in eventlinked bonds structured reinsurance investments and debt securities of any credit rating including those rated below investment grade commonly referred to as junk bonds or if unrated determined by the adviser to be of comparable quality with respect to eventlinked bonds the rating primarily reflects the rating agencys calculated probability that a predefined trigger events will occur as well as the overall expected loss to the bond principal in addition to ratings issued by rating agencies eventlinked bonds are issued with an attachment probability and expected loss percentage determined by catastrophe models a catastrophe model is created based on historical data and averages and used to inform investors and others on the potential impact of a wide variety of catastrophic events the adviser will also consider these catastrophe models in choosing portfolio investments the eventlinked bonds in which the fund may invest may also be subordinated or junior to more senior securities of the issuer the investor in a subordinated security of an issuer is entitled to payment after other holders of debt in that issuer a substantial amount of ils in which the fund intends to invest are expected to be structured as variable rate or floating rate debt securities which will be secured by the collateral contributed by the fund and other investors to the relevant spvs established by the ceding insurer the collateral is invested in secure shortterm instruments such as us treasury money market tmm funds ils typically have rates of interest that reflect the returns of such shortterm collateral instruments plus a premium derivatives the fund may enter into derivatives transactions with respect to any security or other instrument in which it is permitted to invest or any related security instrument index or economic indicator reference instruments derivatives are financial instruments the value of which is derived from the underlying reference instrument derivatives transactions can involve substantial risk derivatives typically allow the fund to increase or decrease the level of risk to which it is exposed more quickly and efficiently than transactions in other types of instruments the fund incurs costs in connection with opening and closing derivatives positions the fund may    engage in the derivative transactions set forth below as well as in other derivative transactions with substantially similar characteristics and risks the fund may but is not required to use futures and options on securities indices and currencies forward foreign currency exchange contracts stock index futures swaps including eventlinked swaps and other derivative instruments the fund may use derivatives for a variety of purposes including i as a hedge against adverse changes in the market prices of securities interest rates or to a lesser extent currency exchange rates ii as a substitute for purchasing or selling securities iii to seek to increase the funds return as a nonhedging strategy that may be considered speculative or iv to manage portfolio exposures certain derivative transactions may give rise to a form of leverage the fund is required to segregate or earmark liquid assets or otherwise cover the funds obligation created by a transaction that may give rise to leverage the use of leverage may cause the fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet segregation requirements leverage may cause the fund to be more volatile than if it had not been leveraged as certain types of leverage may exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the funds portfolio securities the loss on leverage transactions may substantially exceed the initial investment nonus investments the fund may invest without limit in foreign government and foreign corporate debt securities because the majority of ils issuers are domiciled outside the united states the fund will normally invest significant amounts of its assets in foreign securities nonus issuers are issuers that are organized and have their principal offices outside of the united states nonus securities may be issued by nonus governments banks or corporations or private issuers and certain supranational organizations such as the world bank and the european union us government securities the fund may invest in debt securities issued or guaranteed by the us government its agencies or instrumentalities which may consist of  us treasury obligations which differ in their interest rates maturities and times of issuance such as us treasury bills maturity of one year or less us treasury notes maturity of one to ten years and us treasury bonds generally maturities of greater than ten years including the principal components or the interest components issued by the us government under the separate trading of registered interest and principal securities program ie strips all of which are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states and  obligations issued or guaranteed by us government agencies or instrumentalities including government guaranteed mbs some of which are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government some of which are supported by the right of the issuer to borrow from the us government and some of which are backed only by the credit of the issuer itself equity securities the fund may invest in equity securities including common stocks warrants and rights as well as equity equivalents such as preferred stocks and securities convertible into common stock preferred stocks generally pay a dividend and rank ahead of common stocks and behind debt securities in claims for dividends and for assets of the issuer in a liquidation or bankruptcy the dividend rate of preferred stocks may cause their prices to behave more like those of debt securities a convertible security is one that can be converted into or exchanged for common stock of an issuer within a particular period of time at a specified price upon the occurrence of certain events or according to a price formula convertible securities offer the fund the ability to participate in stock market movements while also seeking some current income convertible debt securities pay interest and convertible preferred stocks pay dividends until they mature or are converted exchanged or redeemed the fund considers some convertible securities to be equity equivalents because they are convertible into common stock the credit ratings of those convertible securities generally have less impact on the investment decision although they may still be subject to credit and interest rate risk    borrowings the fund may obtain leverage through borrowings in seeking its investment objective the funds borrowings which would be in the form of loans from banks may be on a secured or unsecured basis and at fixed or variable rates of interest the funds ability to obtain leverage through borrowings is dependent upon its ability to establish and maintain an appropriate line of credit the  act requires the fund to maintain continuous asset coverage of not less than  with respect to all borrowings this means that the value of the funds total indebtedness may not exceed onethird of the value of its total assets including such indebtedness measured at the time the fund incurs the indebtedness the fund also may borrow money from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes in an amount not to exceed  of the funds assets such temporary borrowings are not subject to the asset coverage requirements discussed below in connection with the funds borrowings for investment purposes reverse repurchase agreements the fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements pursuant to which the fund transfers securities to a counterparty in return for cash and the fund agrees to repurchase the securities at a later date and for a higher price reverse repurchase agreements are treated as borrowings by the fund are a form of leverage and may make the value of an investment in the fund more volatile and increase the risks of investing in the fund entering into reverse repurchase agreements and other borrowing transactions may cause the fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so in order to satisfy its obligations or meet segregation requirements borrowing money involves transaction and interest costs the fund may pay a commitment fee or other fees to maintain a line of credit and will pay interest on amounts it borrows to the extent required by sec guidelines if a transaction such as a reverse repurchase agreement exposes the fund to an obligation to another party it will either  enter an offsetting covered position for the same type of financial asset or  segregate cash or liquid securities on the books of the custodian with a value sufficient at all times to cover its potential obligations not covered assets used as cover or segregated cannot be sold while the positions requiring cover is open unless replaced with other appropriate assets cash management and temporary investments normally the fund invests substantially all of its assets to meet its investment objectives the fund may invest the remainder of its assets in securities with remaining maturities of less than one year or cash equivalents or may hold cash for temporary defensive purposes including during periods of unusual cash flows the fund may depart from its principal investment strategies and invest part or all of its assets in these securities or may hold cash the fund may adopt a defensive strategy when the adviser believes securities in which the fund normally invests have special or unusual risks or are less attractive due to adverse market economic political or other conditions additional investment practices in addition to the principal investment strategies described above the fund may also use other investment techniques including the following from timetotime shortterm trading the fund does not typically engage in shortterm trading it may however sell an investment even if such investment has only been held for a short period of time if it has achieved its return objective or the investment no longer meets the funds investment criteria if the fund engages in highvolume trading it may incur additional operating expenses which may reduce performance and could cause investors to incur a higher level of taxable income or capital gains securities lending the fund may seek to earn income by lending portfolio securities to brokerdealers or other institutional borrowers the fund does not anticipate lending eventlinked bonds but may lend other portfolio    securities loans will only be made to firms that have been approved by the investment adviser and the investment adviser or the securities lending agent will periodically monitor the financial condition of such organizations while any loans are outstanding the fund may lend up to onethird of the value of its total assets including borrowings or such other amount as is permitted under relevant law the fund will not lend portfolio securities if as a result the aggregate of such loans exceeds   of the value of the funds total assets including such loans loan arrangements made by the fund will comply with all other applicable regulatory requirements for securities lending including with respect to changes in market values termination interest paid on loaned securities and ability to call back loaned securities for voting corporate debt obligations the fund may purchase debt obligations such as bonds debentures notes and preferred stock issued by us and foreign corporations partnerships or other business entities debt securities purchased by the fund may be subordinate to other liabilities of the issuer if a borrower becomes insolvent the borrowers assets may be insufficient to meet its obligations portfolio turnover the fund cannot accurately predict its portfolio turnover rate the funds portfolio turnover rate is expected to be less than  of the funds total assets in the first year of operations a high turnover rate  or more necessarily involves greater expenses to the fund risk considerations the fund is generally sold to i rias that meet certain qualifications ii clients of such rias and iii certain other eligible investors the minimum initial account size is  million subject to certain exceptions see investment minimums investors should carefully consider the funds risks and investment objectives as an investment in the fund may not be appropriate for all investors and is not designed to be a complete investment program an investment in the fund involves a high degree of risk ils in which the fund invests are considered highyield securities or junk bonds it is possible that investing in the fund may result in a loss of some or all of the amount invested before making an investmentallocation decision investors should i consider the suitability of this investment with respect to an investors or a clients investment objectives and individual situation and ii consider factors such as an investors or a clients net worth income age and risk tolerance investment should be avoided where an investorclient has a shortterm investing horizon andor cannot bear the loss of some or all of their investment the fund is subject to the principal risks noted below as with any investment company there is no guarantee that the fund will achieve its investment objective you could lose all or part of your investment in the fund the fund could underperform other investments and your investment will be illiquid no prior history the fund is a newly organized closedend management investment company with no history of operations and thus has no financial statements or other meaningful operating or financial data on which potential investors may evaluate the fund and its performance and is designed for longterm investors and not as a trading vehicle ils risks the principal risk of an investment in an ils is that a trigger events eg i natural events such as a hurricane tornado or earthquake of a particular intensity in a designated geographic area or ii nonnatural events such as large aviation disasters will occur and the fund will lose all or a significant portion of the principal it has invested in the security and right to additional interest payments with respect to the security if multiple trigger events occur that impact a significant portion of the securities held by the fund the fund could suffer substantial losses and an investor will lose money a majority of the funds assets will be invested in ils tied to natural    events and other nonnatural catastrophes and there is inherent uncertainty as to whether when or where such events will occur there is no way to predict whether a trigger event will occur and because of this significant uncertainty ils carry a high degree of risk eventlinked bonds the return of principal and the payment of interest on eventlinked bonds are contingent on the nonoccurrence of a predefined trigger event such as a hurricane or an earthquake of a specific magnitude or other event that leads to physical or economic loss if a trigger event as defined within the terms of an eventlinked bond involves losses or other metrics exceeding a specific magnitude in the geographic region and time period specified therein the fund may lose a portion or all of its accrued interest andor principal invested in such eventlinked bond in addition to the specified trigger events eventlinked bonds may expose the fund to other risks including but not limited to issuer credit default adverse regulatory or jurisdictional interpretations and adverse tax consequences eventlinked bonds are also subject to the risk that the model used to calculate the probability of a trigger event was not accurate and underestimated the likelihood of a trigger event ils may provide for extensions of maturity in order to process and audit loss claims in those cases when a trigger event has or possibly has occurred upon the occurrence or possible occurrence of a trigger event and until the completion of the processing and auditing of applicable loss claims the funds investment in an eventlinked bond may be priced using fair value methods lack of a liquid market may impose the risk of higher transaction costs and the possibility that the fund may be forced to liquidate positions when it would not be advantageous to do so structured reinsurance investments the fund may invest in spvs or similar instruments structured to comprise a portion of a reinsurers catastropheoriented business including but not limited to quota share instruments sometimes referred to as reinsurance sidecars or to provide reinsurance relating to specific risks to insurance or reinsurance companies through a collateralized instrument known as collateralized reinsurance quota shares instruments and other structured reinsurance investments generally will be considered illiquid securities by the fund structured reinsurance investments are typically more customizable but less liquid investments than eventlinked bonds like eventlinked bonds an investor in structured reinsurance investments participates in the premiums and losses associated with underlying reinsurance contracts structured reinsurance investments are subject to the same risks as eventlinked bonds in addition because structure reinsurance investments such as quota share instruments represent an interest in a basket of underlying reinsurance contracts the fund has limited transparency into the individual underlying contracts and therefore must rely upon the risk assessment and sound underwriting practices of the reinsurance company counterparty accordingly it may be more difficult for the adviser to fully evaluate the underlying risk profile of such investments and therefore place the funds assets at greater risk of loss than if the adviser had more complete information since ils issuers typically are structured as bankruptcy remote spvs or similar structures it is unlikely that the fund could lose its investment if the applicable trigger event never occurs however there can be no assurance that ils in which the fund may invest in the future will be structured in a similar manner or that a court would uphold the intended bankruptcy remote characterization of the structure if ils issuers are in the future structured in a different manner it may be possible for the fund to lose its entire investment in an eventlinked bond even if the applicable trigger event never occurs catastrophe modeling risk the adviser will generally consider catastrophe models with respect to the funds investments catastrophe models are designed to assist investors governments and businesses in understanding the potential impact of a wide variety of catastrophic events and allow such parties to analyze the probability of loss in regions with the highest exposure the adviser may use the output of the catastrophe models before and after investment to assist the adviser in assessing the risk of a particular ils or group of such securities a catastrophe model uses insurance scientific and statistical data to estimate the losses that could be    sustained due to a catastrophic event but even the most sophisticated models cannot predict actual losses catastrophe models may be used by the adviser as one input in its risk analysis process for fund investments catastrophe models are created using historical scientific and other related data therefore because such catastrophe models are based upon historical data and averages there is no guarantee that such information will accurately predict the future occurrence location or severity of any particular catastrophic event and thus may fail to accurately calculate the probability of a trigger event and may underestimate the likelihood of a trigger event in addition any errors or imperfections in a catastrophe model or in the data on which they are based or technical issues with the construction of the models including for example data problems andor software or other implementation issues could adversely affect the ability of the adviser to use such analyses or models effectively which in turn could adversely affect the funds performance in implementing the funds investment strategy the adviser may obtain the advice of geovera defined below relating to its assessment of a particular ils or group of such securities geovera employs a dedicated technical risk management and research team that has developed proprietary systems to validate and enhance its use of commercially available products illiquidity and restricted securities risk liquidity risk is the risk that ils held by the fund may be difficult or impossible to sell at the time that the fund would like or at the price that the fund believes the security is currently worth the fund may invest substantially in securities that are illiquid there can be no assurances that a liquid market will be maintained in which case the funds ability to realize full value in the event of the need to liquidate such assets may be impaired andor result in losses to the fund certain ils in which the fund invests will be rule a securities which are securities that generally can be purchased and sold only by institutions that own and invest on a discretionary basis at least  million in securities of issuers not affiliated with such institution qualified institutional buyers or qibs rule a securities are considered restricted securities restricted securities may have an active trading market but carry the risk that the active trading market may not continue to the extent that qualified institutional buyers become for a time uninterested in purchasing ils that are restricted such securities will become illiquid while held by the fund illiquid securities may be difficult to value the fund may be required to hold illiquid securities when it otherwise would sell such securities or may be forced to sell securities at a price lower than the price the fund has valued such securities this may result in losses to the fund and investors valuation risk the fund is subject to valuation risk which is the risk that one or more of the securities in which the fund invests are priced incorrectly due to factors such as incomplete data market instability or human error in addition pricing of ils is subject to the added uncertainty caused by the inability to generally predict whether when or where a natural disaster or other trigger event will occur the funds investments in ils for which market quotations are not available will be valued pursuant to procedures adopted by the board upon the occurrence or possible occurrence of a trigger event and until the completion of the processing and auditing of applicable loss claims the funds investment in an eventlinked bond may be priced using fair value methods portfolio securities that are valued using techniques other than market quotations including fair valued securities may be subject to greater fluctuation in their value from one day to the next than would be the case if market quotations were used in addition there is no assurance that the fund could sell a portfolio security for the value established for it at any time and it is possible that the fund would incur a loss because a portfolio security is sold at a discount to its established value if securities are mispriced investors could lose money upon redemption because the value of the shares sold is worth more due to the mispricing or could pay too much for shares purchased because the fund overvalued the shares due to the mispricing moral hazard risk ils are generally subject to one or more types of triggers including socalled indemnitytriggers an indemnity trigger is a trigger based on the actual losses of the ceding sponsor ie the party seeking to diversify its insurance portfolio ils subject to indemnity triggers are often regarded as being subject to potential moral hazard since such ils are triggered by actual losses of the ceding sponsor and the ceding sponsor may have an incentive to take actions andor risks that would have an adverse effect on the fund    for example if an eventlinked bond issued will be triggered at  million in losses to the sponsor once that trigger is hit ie the sponsor experiences  million in losses under the contracts it has written the bond purchaser will lose all or a portion of its principal invested plus any additional interest in this situation the ceding sponsor has an incentive to pay the claims more generously when the loss amount is near the trigger amount set in the bond ie to claim  million in losses when perhaps it could be argued that actual losses were  million thus bonds with indemnity triggers may be subject to moral hazard because the trigger depends on the ceding sponsor to properly identify and calculate losses that do and do not apply in determining whether the trigger amount has been reached in short moral hazard refers to this potential for the sponsor to influence bond performance as payouts are based on the individual policy claims against the sponsor and the way the sponsor settles those claims ils market and reinvestment risk the size of the ils market may change over time which may limit the availability of ils for investment by the fund the original issuance of ils in general including ils with desired instrument or risk characteristics may fluctuate depending on the capital and capacity needs of reinsurers as well as the demand for ils by investors the availability of ils in the secondary market also may be limited by supply and demand dynamics and prevailing economic conditions to the extent ils held by the fund mature or the fund must sell securities in connection with share repurchases the fund may be required to hold more cash or shortterm instruments than it normally would until attractive ils becomes available holding excess cash andor reinvestment in securities that are lower yielding or less desirable than securities sold may negatively affect performance investments in nonvoting stock risk to the extent the fund contractually forgoes its right to vote securities or purchases nonvoting securities of an spv it will not be able to vote on matters that require the approval of the investors in the spv including matters that could adversely affect the funds investment in the spv if ils in which the fund invests carry voting rights the fund ordinarily will limit such investments to  or less of the issuing spvs outstanding voting securities however to enable the fund to invest more of its assets in certain spvs deemed attractive by the adviser the fund may also contractually forego its right to vote securities or purchase nonvoting securities of such spvs if the fund does not limit its voting rights and is deemed an affiliate of the spv the ability of the fund to make future investments in the spv or to engage in other transactions would be severely limited by the requirements of the  act such limitations may interfere with the portfolio management of the fund and may adversely impact the funds performance for various reasons the fund may hold some or all of its interest in an spv in nonvoting form one reason for this is to avoid a spv being deemed an affiliated person of the fund for purposes of the  act accordingly the fund may agree to waive irrevocably any right that the fund may have to vote securities in amounts in excess of  of a spvs outstanding voting securities the general policy to waive voting rights has been reviewed by the board the waiver of the funds voting rights does not facilitate investments in a spv by the adviser or other clients of the adviser either as a practical or a legal matter and is not intended to confer any benefit on such entities interests in a particular spv even without voting rights are selected based on the investment merits of those interests consistent with the fiduciary duties of both the adviser and the board and generally reflect the judgment of the adviser that such investments are an attractive and appropriate opportunity for the fund for any number of reasons to the extent the fund holds nonvoting securities of a spv or contractually foregoes its right to vote securities of a spv it will not be able to vote to the full extent of its economic interest on matters that require the approval of the investors in the spv this restriction could diminish the influence of the fund in an spv and adversely affect its investment in the spv which could result in unpredictable and potentially adverse effects on shareholders moreover there is a risk that a court or securities regulators could disregard the statutory definition of affiliated person and still treat the spvs as an affiliated person of the fund for purposes of the  act reinsurance industry risk the performance of ils and the reinsurance industry itself are tied to the occurrence of various trigger events including weather other natural disasters hurricanes earthquakes etc as    well as other nonnatural catastrophes trigger events are typically defined by three criteria the occurrence of a predefined event a geographic area in which the event mush occur and the exceedance of a threshold of economic or physical loss by a company or industry sector physical parameters that define the event such as earthquake magnitude or hurricane wind speed or modeled values based on a combination of the preceding factors major disasters in population centers such as los angeles northridge earthquake  or new orleans hurricane katrina  or related to highvalue insured property such as the piper alpha oil rig explosion  can result in significant losses with investors in ils exposed to such events experiencing substantial losses if the frequency and severity of natural and nonnatural disasters increases the risk of significant losses to reinsurers and ils investors may increase typically one significant trigger event even in a major metropolitan area will not result in the financial failure of a reinsurer however a series of major trigger events could cause the failure of a reinsurer similarly to the extent the fund invests in ils for which a trigger event occurs it may result in losses to the fund and a series of major trigger events affecting a large portion of ils held by the fund may result in substantial losses to the fund floatingrate loan risks a significant percentage of ils in which the fund invests are expected to be variable rate or floating rate eventlinked bonds floating rate loans and similar investments may be illiquid or less liquid than other investments in addition while the collateral securing most eventlinked bonds in which the fund currently intends to invest will be invested in lowrisk investments certain spvs in which the fund invests may permit investment of collateral in higherrisk higheryielding investments thus the value of collateral if any securing the funds investments in eventlinked bonds can decline or may be insufficient to meet the issuers obligations or may be difficult to liquidate market quotations for these securities may be volatile andor subject to large spreads between bid and ask prices borrowing risk the fund may borrow to meet redemption requests or for investment purposes ie to purchase additional portfolio securities the funds borrowings which would be in the form of loans from banks may be on a secured or unsecured basis and at fixed or variable rates of interest the funds ability to obtain leverage through borrowings is dependent upon its ability to establish and maintain an appropriate line of credit the funds investment portfolio which consists primarily of ils may limit the number of lenders willing to enter into a borrowing arrangement with the fund result in higher borrowing costs to the fund or less favorable terms under the arrangement because such securities are higherrisk instruments as a result the fund may be required to modify its investment program in order to meet the terms of any borrowing arrangement if so the fund may not meet its investment objectives borrowing also will cost the fund interest expense and other fees the cost of borrowing may reduce the funds return in addition to any more stringent terms imposed by a lender the  act requires the fund to maintain continuous asset coverage of not less than  with respect to all borrowings this would allow the fund to borrow for such purposes an amount equal to as much as   of the value of its total assets the fund will borrow only if the value of the funds assets including borrowings is equal to at least  of all borrowings including the proposed borrowing if at any time the fund should fail to meet this  coverage requirement within three days thereafter not including sundays and holidays or such longer period as the commission may prescribe by rules and regulations the fund will reduce the amount of its borrowings to an extent that the asset coverage of such borrowings shall be at least  the fund may be required to dispose of portfolio investments on unfavorable terms if market fluctuations reduce its asset coverage to less than  leveraging risk the fund may borrow or enter into derivative transactions for investment purposes which will cause the fund to incur investment leverage therefore the fund is subject to leveraging risk leverage magnifies the funds exposure to declines in the value of one or more underlying investments or creates investment risk with respect to    a larger pool of assets than the fund would otherwise have this risk is enhanced for the fund because it invests substantially all its assets in ils ils can quickly lose all or much of their value if a trigger event occurs thus to the extent assets subject to a trigger event are leveraged the losses could substantially outweigh the funds investment and result in significant losses to the funds net asset value the value of an investment in the fund will be more volatile and other risks tend to be compounded if and to the extent the fund borrows or uses derivatives or other investments that have embedded leverage engaging in such transactions may cause the fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or meet segregation requirements derivative investments risk the fund may obtain eventlinked exposure by investing in among others eventlinked swaps which typically are contingent or formulaically related to defined trigger events or by pursuing similar eventlinked derivative strategies trigger events include hurricanes earthquakes weatherrelated phenomena and other criteria determined by independent parties if a trigger events occurs the fund may lose the swaps notional amount as derivative instruments eventlinked swaps are subject to risks in addition to the risks of investing in ils including counterparty risk and leverage risk the use of derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the asset index rate or instrument underlying a derivative due to failure of a counterparty or due to tax or regulatory constraints derivatives may create economic leverage in the fund which magnifies the funds exposure to the underlying investment derivatives risk may be more significant when derivatives are used to enhance return or as a substitute for a cash investment position rather than solely to hedge the risk of a position held by the fund when derivatives are used to gain or limit exposure to a particular market or market segment their performance may not correlate as expected to the performance of such market thereby causing the fund to fail to achieve its original purpose for using such derivatives a decision as to whether when and how to use derivatives involves the exercise of specialized skill and judgment and a transaction may be unsuccessful in whole or in part because of market behavior or unexpected events derivative instruments may be difficult to value may be illiquid and may be subject to wide swings in valuation caused by changes in the value of the underlying instrument if a derivatives counterparty is unable to honor its commitments the value of fund shares may decline and the fund could experience delays in the return of collateral or other assets held by the counterparty and an investor may lose money the loss on derivative transactions may substantially exceed the initial investment options risk a decision as to whether when and how to use options involves the exercise of skill and judgment and even a wellconceived and wellexecuted options program may be adversely affected by market behavior or unexpected events successful options strategies may require the anticipation of future movements in securities prices interest rates and other economic factors no assurances can be given that the advisers judgment in this respect will be correct the trading price of options may be adversely affected if the market for such options becomes less liquid or smaller the fund may close out a written option position by buying the option instead of letting it expire or be exercised similarly the fund may close out a purchased option position by selling the option instead of holding until exercise there can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist when the fund seeks to close out an option position by buying or selling the option reasons for the absence of a liquid secondary market on an exchange include the following i there may be insufficient trading interest in certain options ii restrictions may be imposed by an exchange on opening transactions or closing transactions or both iii trading halts suspensions or other restrictions may be imposed with respect to particular classes or series of options iv unusual or unforeseen circumstances may interrupt normal operations on an exchange v the facilities of an exchange or a market clearinghouse may not at all times be adequate to handle current trading volume or vi a regulator or one or more exchanges could for economic or other reasons decide to discontinue the trading of    options or a particular class or series of options at some future date if trading were discontinued the secondary market on that exchange or in that class or series of options would cease to exist there are significant differences between securities and options markets that could result in an imperfect correlation between these markets causing a given transaction not to achieve its objectives below investment grade securities risk the fund can invest without limit in ils that are rated below investment grade commonly called junk bonds which are bonds rated below bbb by sp or baa by moodys or that have comparable ratings by another rating organization the rating primarily reflects the rating agencys calculated probability that a predefined trigger event will occur therefore securities with a lower rating reflect the rating agencys assessment of the substantial risk that a trigger event will occur and result in a loss the rating also assesses ils credit risk and the model used to calculate the probability of the trigger event the rating system for ils is less developed than that of corporate bonds and continues to evolve as the market develops there is no minimum rating on the bonds in which the fund may invest the fund may also invest without limit in ils that are unrated and are judged by the adviser to be of below investment grade quality most rating agencies rely upon one or more of the reports prepared by the following three independent catastrophe modeling firms air worldwide corporation eqecat inc and risk management solutions inc one or more of these modeling firms may be used by the adviser as part of its investment process these firms utilize different methodologies to evaluate the probability of various types of predefined trigger events if the reports used by the rating agency are flawed it may cause a rating agency to assign a rating to an ils that is not justified therefore to the extent the adviser relies on rating agency ratings to select securities for the fund the fund may be exposed to greater risks additionally because there are only three major independent catastrophe modeling firms the effects of a flawed model or report issued by one or more of such firms will be magnified credit and collateral risk ils in which the fund invests will be subject to credit risk the principal invested in an ils may be held by the spv in a collateral account and invested in various permissible assets set forth under the terms of the spv typically the collateral account is invested in highquality us government securities ie us treasury bonds however in certain ils the collateral account may be invested in highyielding higherrisk securities in such instances the fund will be subject to the risk of nonpayment of scheduled principal and interest on such collateral account investments such nonpayments and defaults may reduce the income to the fund from the collateral account and negatively impact the value of fund shares in addition the collateral will be invested in accordance with the terms of the spv and overseen by a collateral manager appointed by the spv and therefore the fund is dependent upon the manager to invest the collateral account proceeds appropriately there is no guarantee that the value of the collateral in the collateral account will equal the principal amount of the security either upon the purchase sale or maturity of the ils foreign investing risk the fund may invest in ils issued by foreign sovereigns and foreign entities that are corporations partnerships trusts or other types of business entities because the majority of ils issuers are domiciled outside the united states the fund will normally invest significant amounts of its assets in nonus entities accordingly the fund may invest without limitation in securities issued by nonus entities including those in emerging market countries certain spvs in which the fund invests may be sponsored by nonus ceding insurers that are not subject to the same regulation as that to which us ceding insurers are subject such spvs may pose a greater risk of loss for example due to less stringent underwriting andor riskretention requirements the funds investments will consist primarily of eventlinked bonds and structured reinsurance investments which provide the fund with contractual rights under the terms of the issuance while the contractual rights of eventlinked bonds and structured reinsurance investments issued are similar whether they are issued by a us issuer or a nonus issuer there may be certain additional risks associated with nonus issuers for example foreign    issuers could be affected by factors not present in the us including expropriation confiscatory taxation lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards less publicly available financial and other information potential difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and increased costs to enforce applicable contractual obligations outside the us settlements of securities transactions in foreign countries are subject to risk of loss may be delayed and are generally less frequent than in the us which could affect the liquidity of the funds assets foreign currency risk it is expected that a substantial portion of the funds investments in ils will be us dollar denominated investments to the extent the fund invests in nonus denominated instruments a change in the value of a foreign currency against the us dollar will result in a change in the us dollar value of securities denominated in that foreign currency if the us dollar rises in value against a foreign currency a security denominated in that currency will be worth less in us dollars and if the us dollar decreases in value against a foreign currency a security denominated in that currency will be worth more in us dollars the dollar value of foreign investments may also be affected by exchange controls equity securities risk the fund may at times invest in equity securities the stocks in which the fund invests may be more volatile than the stock market as a whole the value of equity investments and related instruments may decline in response to conditions affecting the general economy overall market changes local regional or global political social or economic instability and currency interest rate and commodity price fluctuations as well as issuer or sector specific events market conditions may affect certain types of stocks to a greater extent than other types of stocks if the stock market declines the value of fund shares will also likely decline and although stock values can rebound there is no assurance that values will return to previous levels preferred stocks may also be sensitive to changes in interest rates when interest rates rise the value of preferred stocks will generally fall investment company and other pooled investment vehicle risk investment in investment companies and other pooled investment vehicles typically reflects the risks of the underlying portfolio investments of such investment company or other pooled investment vehicle the funds shareholders bear both their proportionate share of the funds expenses and similar expenses of the investment company or other pooled investment vehicle the price and movement of an etf may not track the underlying index and may result in a loss in addition etfs and closedend funds may trade at a price below their net asset value also known as a discount some etfs are not structured as investment companies and thus are not regulated under the  act certain pooled investment vehicles do not have the protections applicable to other types of investments under us federal securities or commodities laws and may be subject to counterparty or credit risk there may be no active market for shares of certain etfs closedend funds or other pooled investment vehicles and such shares may be highly illiquid nondiversification risk the fund is classified as a nondiversified fund under the  act accordingly the fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer than if it were a diversified fund to the extent that the fund invests a higher percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer the fund is more likely to become subject to the risks associated with and developments affecting that issuer than a fund that invests more widely tax risk in order for the fund to qualify for treatment as a ric under subchapter m of chapter  of the code the fund must derive at least  of its gross income each taxable year from qualifying income as described in more    detail in the sai meet certain asset diversification tests at the end of each fiscal quarter and distribute at least  of its investment company taxable income ie net investment income and the excess of net shortterm capital gain over net longterm capital loss for each taxable year if in any year the fund fails to qualify as a ric under the code for any reason the fund would be taxed as an ordinary corporation and would become or remain subject to corporate us federal income tax the resulting us federal corporate taxes could substantially reduce the funds net assets the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of distributions such a failure would have a material adverse effect on the fund and its shareholders the fund intends to invest substantially in eventlinked bonds structured reinsurance investments and other interests that are treated as equity in passive foreign investment companies pfics for federal income tax purposes the fund generally intends to make a qualified electing fund qef election with respect to each such pfic which would result in the fund recognizing income and gain each year based on its allocable share of the income and gain recognized by the qef whether or not such amounts are distributed the fund will only be able to make a qef election with respect to a pfic however if that pfic provides information about its income and gain to its investors each year if the fund is not able make a qef election with respect to a pfic it will generally elect to mark to market shares that it holds in the pfic at the end of each taxable year by making this election the fund will recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of those pfic shares as of the close of the taxable year subject to adjustments for deferral of losses from the taxable year over their adjusted basis and as ordinary loss any decrease in that value unless the loss is required to be deferred gains realized with respect to pfics that the fund has elected to mark to market will be ordinary income if the fund realizes a loss with respect to such a pfic whether by virtue of selling all or part of the funds interest in the pfic or because of the mark to market adjustment described above the loss will be ordinary to the extent of the excess of the sum of the marktomarket gains over the marktomarket losses previously recognized with respect to the pfic to the extent that the funds marktomarket loss with respect to a pfic exceeds that limitation the loss will effectively be taken into account in offsetting future marktomarket gains from the pfic and any remaining loss will generally be deferred until the pfic shares are sold at which point the loss will be treated as a capital loss losses on shares of pfics with respect to which no marktomarket election is made will also generally be capital in character capital losses recognized by the fund in a taxable year will generally be deductible only against capital gains recognized by the fund in that year or in future years but if the fund does not generate sufficient capital gains from its investments capital losses recognized by the fund will generally not result in a reduction of taxable distributions to shareholders by making either a qef or marktomarket election with respect to a pfic the fund may be required to recognize income which generally must be distributed to shareholders in excess of the distributions that it receives from that pfic in addition if a sufficient portion of the voting interests in a foreign issuer are held by the fund individually or together with other us persons that issuer may be treated as a controlled foreign corporation with respect to the fund in which case the fund will be required to take into account each year as ordinary income its share of certain portions of that issuers income whether or not such amounts are distributed in any of these circumstances the fund may need to borrow money or to dispose of certain investments in order to make the distributions required for treatment as a ric if neither a mark to market nor a qef election is made with respect to an interest in a pfic the ownership of the pfic interest may have significantly adverse tax consequences for the owner in such a case the fund would be subject to an interest charge at the rate applicable to tax underpayments on the tax liability treated as having been deferred with respect to certain distributions and on gain from the disposition of the shares of a pfic collectively referred to as excess distributions even if those excess distributions are paid by the fund as a dividend to shareholders prepayment or call risk many fixed income securities give the issuer the option to prepay or call the security prior to its maturity date issuers often exercise this right when interest rates fall accordingly if the fund holds a fixed income security    that can be prepaid or called prior to its maturity date it may not benefit fully from the increase in value that other fixed income securities generally experience when interest rates fall upon prepayment of the security the fund also would be forced to reinvest the proceeds at then current yields which would be lower than the yield of the security that was prepaid or called in addition if the fund purchases a fixed income security at a premium at a price that exceeds its stated par or principal value the fund may lose the amount of the premium paid in the event of prepayment qib qualification risk the fund may not have sufficient assets to be deemed a qib for purposes of rule a the eventlinked bonds and structured reinsurance investments in which the fund seeks to invest substantially all of its assets are only available to qibs shortly after commencing operations the fund may not immediately reach the  million asset level requirement to qualify as a qib and purchase a securities additionally investment losses or redemptions may cause the funds assets to drop below  million in the event the fund does not qualify as a qib it will not be able to purchase additional eventlinked bonds or structured reinsurance investments which may prevent the fund from achieving its investment objective subordinated securities risk certain spvs in which the fund invests may issue multiple tranches of interests to investors a holder of securities that are subordinated or junior to more senior securities of an issuer is entitled to payment after holders of more senior securities of the issuer subordinated securities are more likely to suffer a credit loss than nonsubordinated securities of the same issuer any loss incurred by the subordinated securities is likely to be proportionately greater and any recovery of interest or principal may take more time as a result even a perceived decline in creditworthiness of the issuer is likely to have a greater impact on them us government securities risk the fund may invest in debt obligations issued or guaranteed by agencies instrumentalities and sponsored enterprises of the us government some us government securities such as us treasury bills notes and bonds and mortgagerelated securities guaranteed by the government national mortgage association gnma are supported by the full faith and credit of the united states others such as those of the federal home loan banks fhlb or the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc are supported by the right of the issuer to borrow from the us treasury others such as those of the federal national mortgage association fnma are supported by the discretionary authority of the us government to purchase the agencys obligations and still others such as those of the student loan marketing association are supported only by the credit of the issuing agency instrumentality or enterprise us government securities historically have not involved the credit risks associated with investments in other types of debt securities although as a result the yields available from us government debt securities are generally lower than the yields available from other securities like other debt securities however the values of us government securities change as interest rates fluctuate on august   sp lowered its longterm sovereign credit rating on the us to aa from aaa any further downgrades of the us credit rating could increase volatility in both stock and bond markets result in higher interest rates and higher treasury yields and increase the costs of all kinds of debt these events could have significant adverse effects on the economy generally and could result in significant adverse impacts on securities issuers and the fund the adviser cannot predict the effects of these or similar events in the future on the us economy and securities markets or on the funds portfolio sector focus risk issuers of ils are generally classified as belonging to the financial services sector however the fund has no current intention to invest in banks or other issuers that may be commonly considered in the financial services    sector as a result of this categorization of ils the fund may be subject to the risks of such focused investing the industries within the financial services sector are subject to extensive government regulation which can limit both the amounts and types of loans and other financial commitments they can make and the interest rates and fees they can charge profitability can be largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital funds and the rate of corporate and consumer debt defaults and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change credit losses resulting from financial difficulties of borrowers can negatively affect the financial services industries insurance companies can be subject to severe price competition the financial services industries are currently undergoing relatively rapid change as existing distinctions between financial service segments become less clear for example recent business combinations have included insurance finance and securities brokerage under single ownership nonus financial services companies including insurance companies may be subject to different levels of regulation than that to which similar companies operating in the us are subject cash management risk the value of the investments held by the fund for cash management or temporary defensive purposes may be affected by changing interest rates and by changes in credit ratings of the investments to the extent that the fund has any uninvested cash the fund would be subject to risk with respect to the depository institution holding the cash during such periods it may be more difficult for the fund to achieve its investment objective securities lending risk as with other extensions of credit there are risks of delay in recovery or even loss of rights in the securities loaned if the borrower of the securities fails financially loans will only be made to firms that have been approved by the investment adviser and the investment adviser or the securities lending agent will periodically monitor the financial condition of such organizations while any loans are outstanding in addition loans will only be made when the investment adviser believes the expected returns net of expenses justify the attendant risk securities loans currently are required to be secured continuously by collateral in cash cash equivalents such as money market instruments or other liquid securities held by the custodian and maintained in an amount at least equal to the market value of the securities loaned the fund may lend up to onethird of the value of its total assets including borrowings or such other amount as is permitted under relevant law quantitative model risk the fund may use quantitative methods to select investments securities or other investments selected using quantitative methods may perform differently from the market as a whole or from their expected performance for many reasons including factors used in building the quantitative analytical framework the weights placed on each factor and changing sources of market returns among others any errors or imperfections in the advisers quantitative analyses or models or in the data on which they are based could adversely affect the ability of the adviser to use such analyses or models effectively which in turn could adversely affect the funds performance there can be no assurance that these methodologies will help the fund to achieve its objective expense risk your actual costs of investing in the fund may be higher than the expenses shown in annual fund operating expenses for a variety of reasons for example expense ratios may be higher than those shown if overall net assets decrease net assets are more likely to decrease and fund expense ratios are more likely to increase when markets are volatile repurchase offers risk as described under periodic repurchase offers below the fund is an interval fund and in order to try to provide liquidity to shareholders the fund subject to applicable law will conduct quarterly repurchase offers typically for  of the funds outstanding shares at nav subject to approval of the board and in all cases such    repurchase offers will be for at least  and not more than  of its outstanding shares at nav pursuant to rule c under the  act the fund believes that these repurchase offers are generally beneficial to the funds shareholders and repurchases generally will be funded from available cash or sales of portfolio securities however repurchase offers and the need to fund repurchase obligations may affect the ability of the fund to be fully invested or force the fund to maintain a higher percentage of its assets in liquid investments which may harm the funds investment performance moreover diminution in the size of the fund through repurchases may result in untimely sales of portfolio securities with associated imputed transaction costs which may be significant and may limit the ability of the fund to participate in new investment opportunities or to achieve its investment objective if the fund employed investment leverage repurchases of shares would compound the adverse effects of leverage in a declining market in addition if the fund borrows money to finance repurchases interest on that borrowing will negatively affect shareholders who do not tender their shares by increasing fund expenses and reducing any net investment income if a repurchase offer is oversubscribed and the fund determines not to repurchase additional shares beyond the repurchase offer amount or if shareholders tender an amount of shares greater than that which the fund is entitled to purchase the fund will repurchase the shares tendered on a pro rata basis and shareholders will have to wait until the next repurchase offer to make another repurchase request as a result shareholders may be unable to liquidate all or a given percentage of their investment in the fund at nav during a particular repurchase offer some shareholders in anticipation of proration may tender more shares than they wish to have repurchased in a particular quarter thereby increasing the likelihood that proration will occur a shareholder may be subject to market and other risks and the nav of shares tendered in a repurchase offer may decline to the extent there is any delay between the repurchase request deadline and the date on which the nav for tendered shares is determined in addition the repurchase of shares by the fund may be a taxable event to shareholders antitakeover provisions the funds declaration of trust

of dividends by existing investors will be permitted upon completion of the initial offering period thereafter the fund generally expects to reopen to investors and accept orders to purchase shares on a quarterly basis however the funds ability to accept offers to purchase shares after the initial offering period may be limited including during periods when in the judgment of redmond capital appropriate investments for the fund are not available periodic repurchase offers the fund is a closedend interval fund and to provide liquidity and the ability to receive nav on a disposition of at least a portion of your shares makes periodic offers to repurchase shares except as permitted by the funds interval structure no shareholder will have the right to require the fund to repurchase its shares no public market for shares exists and none is expected to develop in the future consequently shareholders generally will not be able to liquidate their investment other than as a result of repurchases of their shares by the fund which may take a number of years to complete if repurchase offers are oversubscribed the fund has adopted pursuant to rule c under the  act a fundamental policy which cannot be changed without shareholder approval requiring the fund to offer to repurchase at least  and up to  of its shares at nav on a regular schedule although the policy permits repurchases of between  and  of the funds outstanding shares for each repurchase offer the fund subject to applicable law will conduct quarterly    repurchase offers typically for  of the funds outstanding shares at nav subject to approval of the board and in all cases such repurchase offers will be for at least  and not more than  of the funds outstanding shares at nav the schedule requires the fund to make repurchase offers every three months the fund expects the initial offering of shares to terminate on or about              or such earlier or later date as the adviser may determine in its discretion and the first repurchase offer to be issued the later of              or a date three months following the date upon which the initial offering of shares terminates repurchase dates quarterly repurchase offers occur in the months of february may august and november as discussed below the date on which the repurchase price for shares is determined will be generally on or about the th day of the following month but shall occur no later than the th day after the repurchase request deadline or the next business day if the th day is not a business day repurchase request deadline the date by which shareholders wishing to tender shares for repurchase must respond to the repurchase offer typically falls approximately seven days before the repurchase date when a repurchase offer commences the fund sends at least  calendar days before the repurchase request deadline written notice to each shareholder setting forth among other things        the percentage of outstanding shares that the fund is offering to repurchase and how the fund will purchase shares on a pro rata basis if the offer is oversubscribed        the date on which a shareholders repurchase request is due the repurchase deadline        the date that will be used to determine the funds nav applicable to the repurchase offer the repurchase date see repurchase date above        the date by which the fund will pay to shareholders the proceeds from their shares accepted for repurchase        the nav of the shares as of a date no more than seven days before the date of the written notice and the means by which shareholders may ascertain the nav        the procedures by which shareholders may tender their shares and the right of shareholders to withdraw or modify their tenders before the repurchase request deadline        the circumstances in which the fund may suspend or postpone the repurchase offer this notice may be included in a shareholder report or other fund document the repurchase request deadline will be strictly observed if a shareholder fails to submit a repurchase request in good order by the repurchase request deadline the shareholder will be unable to liquidate shares until a subsequent repurchase offer and will have to resubmit a request in the next repurchase offer shareholders may withdraw or change a repurchase request with a proper instruction submitted in good form at any point before the repurchase request deadline determination of repurchase price and payment for shares the date on which the repurchase price for shares is determined will be generally on or about the th day of the month that follows the repurchase offer the repurchase pricing date but shall occur no later than the th day after the repurchase request deadline or the next business day if the th day is not a business day the fund expects to distribute payment to shareholders between one and three business days after the repurchase pricing date and will distribute such payment no later than seven  calendar days after such date the funds nav per    share may change materially between the date a repurchase offer is mailed and the repurchase request deadline and it may also change materially between the repurchase request deadline and repurchase pricing date the method by which the fund calculates nav is discussed below under determination of nav during the period an offer to repurchase is open shareholders may obtain the current nav by calling the funds transfer agent at                              the fund does not currently charge a repurchase fee however the fund may charge a repurchase fee of up to  which the fund would retain to help offset nonde minimis estimated costs related to the repurchase such as bid to ask spreads incurred by the fund directly or indirectly as a result of repurchasing shares thus allocating estimated transaction costs to the shareholder whose shares are being repurchased the fund may introduce or modify the amount of a repurchase fee at any time the fund may also waive or reduce the repurchase fee if the adviser determines that the repurchase is offset by a corresponding purchase or if for other reasons the fund will not incur transaction costs or will incur reduced transaction costs suspension or postponement of repurchase offers the fund may suspend or postpone a repurchase offer in limited circumstances set forth in rule c under the  act as described below but only with the approval of a majority of the board including a majority of trustees who are not interested persons of the fund as defined in the  act the fund may suspend or postpone a repurchase offer only  if making or effecting the repurchase offer would cause the fund to lose its status as a regulated investment company under the internal revenue code of  as amended  if making or effecting the repurchase offer would cause the shares that are subject to the offer that are either listed on a national securities exchange or quoted in an interdealer quotation system of a national securities association to be neither listed on any national securities exchange nor quoted on any interdealer quotation system of a national securities association  for any period during which the new york stock exchange nyse or any other market in which the securities owned by the fund are principally traded is closed other than customary weekend and holiday closings or during which trading in such market is restricted  for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which disposal by the fund of securities owned by it is not reasonably practicable or during which it is not reasonably practicable for the fund fairly to determine the value of its net assets or  for such other periods as the sec may by order permit for the protection of shareholders of the fund oversubscribed repurchase offers there is no minimum number of shares that must be tendered before the fund will honor repurchase requests however the board sets for each repurchase offer a maximum percentage of shares that may be repurchased by the fund in the event a repurchase offer by the fund is oversubscribed the fund may repurchase but is not required to repurchase additional shares up to a maximum amount of  of the outstanding shares of the fund if the fund determines not to repurchase additional shares beyond the repurchase offer amount or if shareholders tender an amount of shares greater than that which the fund is entitled to repurchase the fund will repurchase the shares tendered on a pro rata basis based on the number of shares tendered if any shares that you wish to tender to the fund are not repurchased because of proration you will have to wait until the next repurchase offer and resubmit a new repurchase request and your repurchase request will not be given any priority over other shareholders requests thus there is a risk that the fund may not purchase all of the shares you wish to have repurchased in a given repurchase offer or in any subsequent repurchase offer in anticipation of the possibility of proration some shareholders may tender more shares than they wish to have repurchased in a particular quarter increasing the likelihood of proration there is no assurance that you will be able to tender your shares when or in the amount that you desire    consequences of repurchase offers from the time the fund distributes or publishes each repurchase offer notification until the repurchase pricing date for that offer the fund must maintain liquid assets at least equal to the percentage of its shares subject to the repurchase offer for this purpose liquid assets means assets that may be sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business at approximately the price at which the fund values them within the period between the repurchase request deadline and the repurchase payment date or which mature by the repurchase payment date the fund is also permitted to borrow up to the maximum extent permitted under the  act to meet repurchase requests if the fund borrows to finance repurchases interest on that borrowing will negatively affect shareholders who do not tender their shares by increasing the funds expenses and reducing any net investment income there is no assurance that the fund will be able sell a significant amount of additional shares so as to mitigate these effects these and other possible risks associated with the funds repurchase offers are described under risk considerationsrepurchase offers risk above in addition the repurchase of shares by the fund will be a taxable event to shareholders potentially even to those shareholders that do not participate in the repurchase for a discussion of these tax consequences see federal income tax matters below services agreement the fund has entered into a services agreement under which the fund may compensate financial industry professionals for providing

agreements with certain intermediaries under which the fund makes payments to the intermediaries in recognition of the avoided transfer agency costs to the fund associated with the intermediaries maintenance of customer accounts or in recognition of the services provided by intermediaries through fund platforms payments made by the fund or the adviser under such agreements are generally based on either  a percentage of the average daily net asset value of the customer shares serviced by the intermediary up to a set maximum or  a per account fee assessed against each account serviced by such intermediary up to a set maximum these payments are in addition to other payments described in this prospectus such as the services agreement investors who invest through financial firms are subject to the eligibility requirements set out herein    net asset value the nav of the funds shares is determined by dividing the total value of the funds portfolio investments plus cash and other assets attributable less any liabilities including accrued expenses or dividends by the total number of shares outstanding the funds shares are valued as of a particular time the valuation time on the last day of each week and last day of each month if different that the new york stock exchange is open for business as of the close of the regular trading session on the new york stock exchange the fund reserves the right to calculate the net asset value more frequently if deemed desirable the valuation time is ordinarily at the close of regular trading on the nyse normally  pm eastern time the board has approved procedures pursuant to which the fund will value its investments in accordance with these procedures afs values the funds investments for which market quotations are readily available at market value market values for various types of securities and other instruments are determined on the basis of closing prices or last prices on an exchange or other market or based on quotes or other market information obtained from quotation reporting systems established market makers brokers data delivery vendors or pricing services to the extent the fund invests in openend management companies that are registered under the  act the funds nav will be calculated based upon the net asset value of such funds the prospectuses for such funds explain the circumstances under which they will use fair value pricing as defined below and its effects please see computation of net asset value in the sai for more information if market values are not readily available including in cases where available market quotations are deemed to be unreliable or infrequent the funds investments will be valued as determined in good faith pursuant to policies and procedures approved by the board fair value pricing in these circumstances the fund determines fair value in a manner that fairly reflects the market value of the security on the valuation date based on consideration of any information or factors it deems appropriate as further described below the valuation committee the committee comprised of officers of the adviser and established pursuant to the policies and procedures adopted by the board has the responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the funds valuation procedures and fair value determinations made on behalf of the board for purposes of determining fair value of securities the committee may use or make use of a variety of valuation methodologies including without limitation i mathematical techniques that refer to the prices of similar or related securities ii a percentage increase or decrease across all securities of a region country or industry affected by a significant event iii a multiple of earnings iv a discount from market of a similar freely traded security v the yield to maturity of debt securities vi the recommendation of a pricing service vii a single brokers or insurance companys quote viii recent primary andor secondary market transactions that the fund believes to be comparable ix modeling or development of events or x any combination of the above fair value pricing may require subjective determinations about the value of an asset or liability fair values used to determine the funds navs may differ from quoted or published prices or from prices that are used by others for the same investments the use of fair value pricing may not always result in adjustments to the prices of securities or other assets or liabilities held by the fund and it is possible that the fair value determined for a security may be materially different than the value that could be realized upon the sale of such security shortterm debt securities which have a maturity date of  days or less are valued at amortized cost which approximates fair value in the event that the funds assets are mispriced investors could lose money upon repurchase because the value of the shares sold is worth more due to the mispricing or could pay too much for shares purchased because the fund overvalued the shares due to the mispricing mispricing may arise for example due to the fact that the pricing service may rely upon indicative quotes which may differ from actual sale price achieved due to variations in time and transaction size it is expected that a substantial portion of the funds investments will be us dollar denominated investments investments initially valued in currencies other than the us dollar are converted to us dollars using exchange rates obtained from pricing services as a result the nav of the funds shares may be affected by changes in the value of currencies in relation to the us dollar international markets are sometimes open on days when us markets are closed which means that the value of foreign securities owned by the fund could change on days    when fund shares cannot be bought or sold the value of investments traded in markets outside the us or denominated in currencies other than the us dollar may be affected significantly on a day that the nyse is closed and the nav of the funds shares may change on days when an investor is not able to purchase shares the calculation of the funds nav may not take place contemporaneously with the determination of the prices of foreign securities used in nav calculations federal income tax matters the following discussion of the us federal income tax consequences of investment in the fund is based on the code us treasury regulations and other applicable authority as of the date of the preparation of this prospectus these authorities are subject to change by legislative or administrative action possibly with retroactive effect the following discussion is only a summary of some of the important us federal tax considerations generally applicable to investments in the fund there may be other tax considerations applicable to particular shareholders such as the  medicare tax on certain investment income us federal estate and gift tax laws and us state taxation among others shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their particular situation and the possible application of foreign state and local tax laws the fund intends to elect and to qualify each year to be treated as a ric under subchapter m of chapter  of the code to qualify the fund must meet certain income asset diversification and distribution requirements as a ric the fund generally will not be subject to federal income or excise taxes on ordinary income and capital gains distributed to shareholders within applicable time limits however the funds failure to qualify as a ric would result in corporate level taxation and consequently a reduction in income available for distribution to you and other shareholders in general if the fund fails to distribute at least  of its ordinary income for the calendar year plus  of its capital gain net income recognized during the oneyear period ending october  of such year or later if the fund is permitted to elect and so elects it will be subject to a nondeductible  excise tax on the underdistributed amount for federal income tax purposes distributions of net investment income are generally taxable to shareholders as ordinary income taxes on distributions of capital gains are determined by how long the fund owned the investments that generated them rather than how long you owned your shares distributions of net capital gains that is the excess of net longterm capital gains from the sale of investments that the fund owned for more than one year over net shortterm capital losses that are properly designated by the fund as capital gain dividends will be taxable as longterm capital gains distribution of net gains from the sale of investments that the fund owned for one year or less will be taxable as ordinary income the maximum longterm capital gain rate is  for individuals with annual taxable income of at least   if married filing jointly and  otherwise distributions of investment income designated by the fund as derived from qualified dividend income will be taxed in the hands of individuals at the rates applicable to longterm capital gains provided that certain holding period and other requirements are met at both the shareholder and fund level a distribution will be treated as paid on december  of the current calendar year if it is declared by the fund in october november or december with a record date in such a month and paid by the fund during january of the following calendar year distributions are taxable to you even if they are paid from income or gains earned before your investment and thus were included in the price you paid for your shares in general you will be taxed on the distributions

receive them as additional shares or in cash any gain resulting from the sale or exchange of your shares in the fund will generally be subject to tax the funds investment in foreign securities may be subject to foreign withholding taxes in that case the funds yield on those securities would be decreased however the fund may be able to pass through to you a deduction or credit for such foreign taxes as further described in the sai in addition the funds investments in foreign securities or foreign currencies may increase or accelerate the funds recognition of ordinary income and may affect the timing amount or character of the funds distributions the fund intends to invest substantially in eventlinked bonds which are typically treated as equity in pfics for federal income tax purposes investments by the fund in a pfic could potentially subject the fund to a us federal income tax including interest charges on distributions received from the pfic or on proceeds received from the disposition of shares in the pfic this tax cannot be eliminated by making distributions to fund shareholders however the fund may make elections to avoid the imposition of such taxes the fund generally intends to elect to treat a pfic as a qualified electing fund ie make a qef election in which case the fund will be required to include its share of the pfics income and net capital gains annually regardless of whether it receives any distribution from the pfic the fund will only be able to make a qef election with respect to a pfic however if that pfic provides information about its income and gain to its investors each year if the fund is not able to make a qef election with respect to a pfic it will generally elect to mark the gains and to a limited extent losses in the pfic to the market as though it had sold and repurchased its holdings in the pfic on the last day of the funds taxable year such gains and losses are treated as ordinary income and loss the qef and marktomarket elections may accelerate the recognition of income by the fund without the receipt of cash and increase the amount required to be distributed by the fund to avoid taxation in addition if a sufficient portion of the voting interests in a foreign issuer are held by the fund individually or together with other us persons that issuer may be treated as a controlled foreign corporation with respect to the fund in which case the fund will be required to take into account each year as ordinary income its share of certain portions of that issuers income whether or not such amounts are distributed in any of these situations the fund may need to liquidate other investments including when it is not advantageous to do so to meet its distribution requirement which also may accelerate the recognition of gain and affect the funds total return in addition to the extent that the funds marktomarket loss with respect to a pfic exceeds its prior inclusions the loss will effectively be taken into account in offsetting future marktomarket gains from the pfic and any remaining loss will generally be deferred until the pfic shares are sold at which point the loss will be treated as a capital loss losses on shares of pfics with respect to which no marktomarket election is made will also generally be capital in character such capital losses will generally be deductible only against capital gains recognized by the fund in that year or in future years but if the fund does not generate sufficient capital gains from its investments capital losses recognized by the fund will generally not result in a reduction of taxable distributions to shareholders dividends paid by pfics will not be eligible to be treated as qualified dividend income in general dividends other than capital gain dividends paid by the fund to a person who is not a us person within the meaning of the code a foreign person are subject to withholding of us federal income tax at a rate of  or lower applicable treaty rate in addition under the foreign account tax compliance act facta withholding may be imposed on ordinary dividends paid by the fund as well as capital gain distributions redemptions and proceeds from sales of fund shares paid on or after january   payable to certain shareholders that fail to meet prescribed information reporting or certification requirements in general no such withholding will occur with respect to a us person or nonus individual that timely provides a valid irs form w or w respectively see the sai for further discussion of potential facta considerations by february  of each year we will send you a statement showing the tax status of your dividends and distributions for the prior year repurchase of shares the repurchase of fund shares may give rise to a gain or loss in general any gain or loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares will be treated as longterm capital gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than  months otherwise the gain or loss will generally be treated as shortterm capital    gain or loss any loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares held for six months or less will be treated as longterm rather than shortterm to the extent of any capital gain dividends received by the shareholder with respect to the shares all or a portion of any loss realized upon a taxable disposition of fund shares will be disallowed if other substantially identical shares of the fund are purchased within  days before or after the disposition in such a case the basis of the newly purchased shares will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss a repurchase by the fund of its shares from a shareholder see periodic repurchase offers above generally will be treated as a sale of the shares by a shareholder provided that after the repurchase the shareholder does not own either directly or by attribution under section  of the code any shares if after a repurchase a shareholder continues to own directly or by attribution any shares it is possible that any amounts received by such shareholder in the repurchase will be taxable as a dividend to such shareholder and there is a risk that shareholders who do not have any of their shares repurchased would be treated as having received a dividend distribution as a result of their proportionate increase in the ownership of the fund use of the funds cash to repurchase shares could adversely affect the funds ability to satisfy the distribution requirements for qualification as a regulated investment company the fund could also recognize income in connection with the liquidation of portfolio securities to fund share repurchases any such income would be taken into account in determining whether the distribution requirements were satisfied the discussion above is very general please consult your tax adviser about the effect that an investment in the fund could have on your own tax situation including possible foreign federal state or local tax consequences or about any other tax questions you may have dividend reinvestment plan it is the funds policy to make distributions at least annually of all or substantially all of its net investment income and net realized capital gains if any unless you elect to receive your distributions in cash your ordinary income and capital gain distributions will be reinvested in additional shares of the same share class of the fund at nav calculated as of the payment date the fund will pay distributions on a pershare basis as a result on the exdividend date of such a payment the nav of the fund will be reduced by the amount of the payment dividends and capital gains distributions are automatically reinvested unless otherwise noted you may notify the transfer agent in writing to        choose to receive dividends or distributions or both in cash or        change the way you currently receive distributions your taxable income is the same regardless of which option you choose for further information about dividend reinvestment contact the transfer agent by telephone at                              description of the fund the fund is a statutory trust established

the structure if this were to occur or if ils are structured in a different way in the future it is possible that the fund could lose its entire investment in an ils event though a designated trigger events has not occurred    eventlinked bonds the fund may invest in eventlinked bonds which sometimes are referred to as insurancelinked catastrophe or cat bonds eventlinked bonds are typically floating rate debt securities for which the return of principal and payment of interest are contingent on the nonoccurrence of a specified trigger events such as an earthquake or hurricane of a particular intensity the fund may invest in eventlinked bonds in one or more of three primary ways the fund may purchase eventlinked bonds when initially offered the fund may purchase eventlinked bonds in the secondary overthecounter market or the fund may gain indirect exposure to eventlinked bonds using derivatives such as eventlinked swaps eventlinked swaps are derivative instruments that are typically contingent or formulaically related to defined trigger events eventlinked bonds may be issued by government agencies insurance companies reinsurers special purpose corporations or other us or nonus entities eventlinked bonds are often rated by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization nrsro but also may be unrated the rating for an eventlinked bond primarily reflects the rating agencys calculated probability that a trigger event will occur this rating also assesses the eventlinked bonds credit risk and the model used to calculate the probability of a trigger event trigger events can include natural events eg hurricanes earthquakes and weatherrelated phenomena and nonnatural events eg large aviation or marine events trigger events are typically defined by three criteria the occurrence of a predefined event a geographic area in which the event must occur and the exceedance of a threshold of economic or physical loss by a company or industry sector physical parameters that define the event such as earthquake magnitude or hurricane wind speed or modeled values based on a combination of the preceding factors in order for a trigger event to be deemed to have occurred in most cases each of the three criteria must be satisfied while the bond is outstanding the fund may invest in other types of eventlinked bonds where the trigger event may be based on companywide losses indemnity triggers indexbased losses index triggers or a combination of triggers hybrid triggers indemnity triggers indemnity triggers are typically based on losses of the insurance company or other entity issuing the eventlinked bond the trigger event would be considered to have occurred if a companys losses on catastrophic insurance claims exceeded a certain aggregate amount if the companys losses were less than the predetermined aggregate amount the trigger event would not be considered to have occurred and the fund would be entitled to recover its principal plus any accrued but unpaid interest indemnity triggers require investors and rating agencies to understand the risks of the insurance and reinsurance policies underwritten by the company which may be difficult to obtain and assess particularly in the case of complex commercial insurance and reinsurance policies in addition eventlinked bond investors are dependent upon the companys ability to settle catastrophe claims in a manner that would not be disadvantageous to investors interests index triggers index triggers typically use one of three broad approaches parametric industry loss or modeled loss index triggers generally use predefined formulas to calculate principal loss which minimizes risks relating to an individual companys insurance claimshandling practices and other companyspecific business practices index triggers do expose the investor to other risks such as delay in or failure to report index values accurately or on a timely basis parametric parametric index triggers are based upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event in a certain geographic location with predefined physical characteristics such as earthquake magnitude or hurricane wind speed industry loss industry loss index triggers are often based upon the estimated loss from a catastrophic event for the insurance industry as a whole or for a specific subsector estimates are derived from a thirdparty reporting service such as property claim services or perils modeled loss modeled loss index triggers typically take the physical parameters that define a catastrophic event such as geographic location and intensity and apply them to a predefined portfolio of notional risks using a thirdparty catastrophe model to calculate an index value that approximates the damage caused by the event    hybrid triggers hybrid triggers use more than one trigger type to determine the potential principal reduction of an eventlinked bond for example a hybrid trigger could require the occurrence of both a us hurricane and a japanese earthquake each with different trigger values within a given time period in order for principal reduction to occur another example of a hybrid trigger would be for a us hurricane to occur with winds that exceeded a certain value in a given geographic location a parametric trigger that also caused us insured property losses to exceed a certain value an industry loss trigger before an eventlinked bond could start losing principal the fund has no limit as to the types of events geographic areas or thresholds of loss referenced by eventlinked bonds in which it can invest generally the event is either a natural or nonnatural peril of a kind that results in significant physical or economic loss natural perils include disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes windstorms fires and floods nonnatural perils include disasters resulting from human activity such as commercial and industrial accidents or business interruptions eventlinked bonds are typically rated by at least one nrsro but also may be unrated although each rating agency utilizes its own general guidelines and methodology to evaluate the risks of an eventlinked bond the average rating in the current market for eventlinked bonds is bb by standard poors rating services sp or the equivalent rating for another rating agency however there are eventlinked bonds rated higher or lower than bb the funds investments in eventlinked bonds generally will be rated b bb or bbb at the time of purchase although the fund may invest in eventlinked bonds rated higher or lower than these ratings as well as eventlinked bonds that are unrated the rating for an eventlinked bond primarily reflects the rating agencys calculated probability that a predefined trigger event will occur this rating also assesses the bonds credit risk and model used to calculate the probability of the trigger event eventlinked bonds typically are restricted to qualified institutional buyers and therefore are not subject to registration with the securities and exchange commission sec or any state securities commission and are not listed on any national securities exchange the amount of publicly information available with respect to eventlinked bonds is generally less extensive than that available for issuers of registered or exchange listed securities eventlinked bonds may be subject to the risks of adverse regulatory or jurisdictional determinations there can be no assurance that future regulatory determinations will not adversely affect the overall market for eventlinked bonds eventlinked swaps the fund may obtain eventlinked exposure by investing in eventlinked swaps which typically are contingent or formulaically related to defined trigger events or by pursuing similar eventlinked derivative strategies trigger events may include hurricanes earthquakes and weatherrelated phenomena if a trigger event occurs the fund may lose the swaps notional amount as derivative instruments eventlinked swaps are subject to risks in addition to the risks of investing in eventlinked bonds including counterparty risk and leverage risk structured reinsurance investments the fund may invest in spvs or similar instruments structured to comprise a portion of a reinsurers catastropheoriented business including but not limited to quota share instruments sometimes referred to as reinsurance sidecars or to provide reinsurance relating to specific risks to insurance or reinsurance companies through a collateralized instrument sometimes known as collateralized reinsurance quota share instruments and other structured reinsurance investments generally will be considered illiquid securities by the fund the fund may invest substantially in illiquid securities structured reinsurance investments developed along with eventlinked bonds as a mechanism to facilitate risktransfer from insurance markets to capital markets investors these instruments are typically more customizable but less liquid investments than eventlinked bonds like some eventlinked bonds an investor in structured reinsurance investments participates in the premiums and losses associated with underlying reinsurance contracts where the instruments are based on the performance of underlying reinsurance contracts the fund has limited transparency    into the underlying insurance policies and therefore must rely upon the risk assessment and underwriting practices of the reinsurance company counterparty the instruments typically mature in one year the fund may invest indirectly in reinsurance contracts by holding notes or preferred shares issued by a spv whose performance is tied to an underlying reinsurance transaction including structured reinsurance investments such as quota share instruments quota share instruments are a form of proportional reinsurance in which an investor participates in the premiums and losses of a reinsurers portfolio of catastropheoriented policies according to a predefined percentage for example under a  quota share agreement the spv would be entitled to  of all premiums associated with a defined portfolio and be responsible for  of all related claims collateralized reinsurance investments are privately structured securities or derivatives utilized to gain exposure to the reinsurance market collateralized reinsurance involves an spv entering into a reinsurance arrangement that is then collateralized by invested capital and premiums related to the insurance coverage the collateral is designed to cover in full the potential claims that could arise from the underlying reinsurance contract structured reinsurance investments may include eventlinked swaps such as industry loss warranties ilws ilws are insurancelinked securities used to finance peak nonrecurrent insurance risks such as hurricanes tropical storms and earthquakes ilws feature an industry loss index trigger and in some cases a dual trigger design that includes a protection buyer indemnity trigger a traditional ilw takes the form of a bilateral reinsurance contract but there are also index products that take the form of derivatives collateralized structures or exchange traded instruments an eventlinked swap may also use any of the trigger mechanisms discussed in eventlinked bonds the common feature among these forms is that the principal reduction mechanism is based on an index trigger longevity and mortality bonds the fund may invest in both longevity bonds and mortality bonds which may be fixedincome or floating rate securities typically issued by spvs created by life insurance companies annuity providers and pension obligors to hedge longevity risk and mortality risk respectively faced by those entities longevity risk is the risk that members of a reference population will live longer on average than anticipated mortality risk is the risk that members of a reference population will live shorter on average than anticipated such risks are among the most significant faced by life insurers annuity providers and pension funds because changes in longevity or mortality rates can significantly affect the liabilities and cash needs of those entities the terms of a longevity bond typically provide that the investor in the bond will receive less than the bonds par amount at maturity if the actual average longevity life span of a specified population of people observed over a specified period of time typically measured by a longevity index is higher than a specified level if longevity is higher than expected the bond will return less than its par amount at maturity and could return no principal at maturity other types of longevity bonds may provide that if the actual average longevity of two separate populations of people observed over a specified period of time diverge by more than a specified amount the bonds will pay less than their par amount at maturity a mortality bond in contrast to a longevity bond typically provides that the investor in the bond will receive less than the bonds par amount at maturity if the mortality rate of a specified population of people observed over a specified period of time typically measured by a mortality index is higher than a specified level some mortality bonds often referred to as extreme mortality bonds contain remote event triggers which provide that the bonds will lose principal only if the mortality rate of the specified population is substantially higher than the expected level for example in the event of a flu pandemic or terrorist attack during their term both longevity bonds and mortality bonds typically pay a floating rate of interest to investors longevity bonds and mortality bonds purchased by the fund involve the risk that the adviser may incorrectly predict the actual level of longevity or mortality as applicable for the reference population of people and the fund will lose all or a portion of the amount of their investment in the bond with respect to mortality bonds held    by the fund there is also the risk that an epidemic or other catastrophic event could strike the reference population resulting in mortality rates exceeding expectations and in the fund losing all or a portion of its investment in the bond borrowing risk the fund may borrow to meet redemption requests or for investment purposes ie to purchase additional portfolio securities the funds borrowings which would be in the form of loans from banks may be on a secured or unsecured basis and at fixed or variable rates of interest the funds ability to obtain leverage through borrowings is dependent upon its ability to establish and maintain an appropriate line of credit the funds investment portfolio which consists primarily of ils may limit the number of lenders willing to enter into a borrowing arrangement with the fund result in higher borrowing costs to the fund or less favorable terms under the arrangement because such securities are higherrisk instruments as a result the fund may be required to modify its investment program in order to meet the terms of any borrowing arrangement if so the fund may not meet its investment objectives borrowing also will cost the fund interest expense and other fees the cost of borrowing may reduce the funds return in addition to any more stringent terms imposed by a lender the  act requires the fund to maintain continuous asset coverage of not less than  with respect to all borrowings this would allow the fund to borrow for such purposes an amount equal to as much as   of the value of its total assets the fund will borrow only if the value of the funds assets including borrowings is equal to at least  of all borrowings including the proposed borrowing if at any time the fund should fail to meet this  coverage requirement within three days thereafter not including sundays and holidays or such longer period as the commission may prescribe by rules and regulations the fund will reduce the amount of its borrowings to an extent that the asset coverage of such borrowings shall be at least  the fund may be required to dispose of portfolio investments on unfavorable terms if market fluctuations reduce its asset coverage to less than  leveraging risk the fund may borrow or enter into derivative transactions for investment purposes which will cause the fund to incur investment leverage therefore the fund is subject to leveraging risk leverage magnifies the funds exposure to declines in the value of one or more underlying investments or creates investment risk with respect to a larger pool of assets than the fund would otherwise have this risk is enhanced for the fund because it invests substantially all its assets in ils ils can quickly lose all or much of their value if a trigger event occurs thus to the extent assets subject to a trigger event are leveraged the losses could substantially outweigh the funds investment and result in significant losses to the funds net asset value the value of an investment in the fund will be more volatile and other risks tend to be compounded if and to the extent the fund borrows or uses derivatives or other investments that have embedded leverage engaging in such transactions may cause the fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or meet segregation requirements other debt investments as part of its regular investment program the fund can invest in debt instruments other than eventlinked bonds the fund may invest in debt securities of us or foreign issuers these debt securities may have fixed or floating interest rates may or may not be collateralized and may be below investment grade or if unrated determined by the adviser to be of comparable quality the fund has no limits as to the maturity of debt securities in which the fund invests or as to the market capitalization range of the issuers corporate debt obligations the fund can purchase debt obligations such as bonds debentures notes and preferred stock issued by us and foreign corporations partnerships or other business entities debt securities purchased by the fund may be subordinate to other liabilities of the issuer if a borrower becomes insolvent the borrowers assets may be insufficient to meet its obligations to the holders of its subordinated debt fixed income securities in addition to corporate debt obligations such as bonds debentures and notes fixed income securities also include preferred preference and convertible securities preference stocks are stocks that have many of the characteristics of preferred stocks but are typically junior to an existing class of preferred stocks    certain securities may permit the issuer to call or redeem the securities at its sole option if an issuer were to redeem the securities during a time of declining interest rates the fund may not be able to reinvest the proceeds in securities providing the same investment return as the securities that were redeemed certain securities may have a demand feature allowing the holder to redeem the bonds at specified times these securities are more defensive than conventional longterm securities while providing greater opportunity than comparable intermediate term securities since they may be retained if interest rates decline acquiring these kinds of securities provides the contractual right to require the issuer of the securities to purchase the security at an agreed upon price which right is contained in the obligation itself rather than in a separate agreement or instrument since this right is assignable only with the security it will not be assigned any separate value floating or variable rate obligations may be acquired as shortterm investments pending longerterm investment of funds the rate of interest on fixed income securities may be fixed floating or variable and may vary inversely with respect to a reference rate the rate of return or return of principal on some fixed income securities may be linked or indexed to the level of exchange rates between the us dollar and a foreign currency or currencies subordinated securities the fund may invest in ils and other types of fixed income securities which are subordinated or junior to more senior securities of the issuer or which represent interests in pools of such subordinated or junior securities such securities may include socalled highyield or junk bonds ie bonds that are rated below investment grade by a rating agency or that are of equivalent quality and preferred stock under the terms of subordinated securities payments that would otherwise be made to their holders may be required to be made to the holders of more senior securities andor the subordinated or junior securities may have junior liens if they have any rights at all in any collateral meaning proceeds of the collateral are required to be paid first to the holders of more senior securities as a result subordinated or junior securities will be disproportionately adversely affected by a default or even a perceived decline in creditworthiness of the issuer structured securities the fund may invest in ils and other types of structured securities the value of the principal andor interest on such securities is determined by reference to changes in the value of specific currencies interest rates commodities indices or other financial indicators the reference or the relative change in two or more references the interest rate or the principal amount payable upon maturity or redemption may be increased or decreased depending upon changes in the reference the terms of the structured securities may provide in certain circumstances that no principal is due at maturity and therefore may result in a loss of the funds investment changes in the interest rate or principal payable at maturity may be a multiple of the changes in the value of the reference structured securities are a type of derivative instrument and the payment and credit qualities from these securities derive from the assets embedded in the structure from which they are issued structured securities may entail a greater degree of risk than other types of fixed income securities us government securities the fund may invest in debt securities issued or guaranteed by the us government its agencies or instrumentalities which may consist of  us treasury obligations which differ in their interest rates maturities and times of issuance such as us treasury bills maturity of one year or less us treasury notes maturity of one to ten years and us treasury bonds generally maturities of greater than ten years including the principal components or the interest components issued by the us government under the separate trading of registered interest and principal securities program ie strips all of which are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states and  obligations issued or guaranteed by us government agencies or instrumentalities including government guaranteed mbs some of which are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government some of which are supported by the right of the issuer to borrow from the us government and some of which are backed only by the credit of the issuer itself the fund may invest in debt obligations issued or guaranteed by agencies instrumentalities and sponsored enterprises of the us government some us government securities such as us treasury bills notes and bonds and mortgagerelated securities guaranteed by the government national mortgage association    gnma are supported by the full faith and credit of the united states others such as those of the federal home loan banks fhlb or the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc are supported by the right of the issuer to borrow from the us treasury others such as those of the federal national mortgage association fnma are supported by the discretionary authority of the us government to purchase the agencys obligations and still others such as those of the student loan marketing association are supported only by the credit of the issuing agency instrumentality or enterprise us government securities historically have not involved the credit risks associated with investments in other types of debt securities although as a result the yields available from us government debt securities are generally lower than the yields available from other securities like other debt securities however the values of us government securities change as interest rates fluctuate on august   sp lowered its longterm sovereign credit rating on the us to aa from aaa any further downgrades of the us credit rating could increase volatility in both stock and bond markets result in higher interest rates and higher treasury yields and increase the costs of all kinds of debt these events could have significant adverse effects on the economy generally and could result in significant adverse impacts on securities issuers and the fund the adviser cannot predict the effects of these or similar events in the future on the us economy and securities markets or on the funds portfolio zerocoupon us government securities the fund may invest in zerocoupon us government securities zerocoupon securities are purchased at a discount from the face amount the buyer receives only the right to receive a fixed payment on a certain date in the future and does not receive any periodic interest payments these securities may include those created directly by the us treasury and those created as collateralized obligations through various proprietary custodial trust or other relationships the effect of owning instruments which do not make current interest payments is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but also in effect on all discount accretion during the life of the obligations this implicit reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of being unable to reinvest distributions at a rate as high as the implicit yield on the zerocoupon security but at the same time eliminates any opportunity to reinvest earnings at higher rates for this reason zerocoupon securities are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations during periods of changing market interest rates than those of comparable securities that pay interest currently which fluctuation is greater as the period to maturity is longer zerocoupon securities created as collateralized obligations are similar to those created through the us treasury but the former investments do not provide absolute certainty of maturity or of cash flows after prior classes of the collateralized obligations are retired the funds investment in zerocoupon securities may cause the fund to recognize income and make distributions or allocations to shareholders before it receives any cash payments on the zerocoupon investment to generate cash to satisfy those requirements the fund may have to sell portfolio securities that it otherwise might have continued to hold or to use cash flows from other sources such as the sale of shares other zerocoupon securities the fund may buy zerocoupon and delayed interest securities and stripped securities of us and foreign corporations and of foreign government issuers these are similar in structure to zerocoupon and stripped us government securities but in the case of foreign government securities may or may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the issuing foreign government zerocoupon securities issued by foreign governments and by corporations will be subject to greater credit risks than us government zerocoupon securities other stripped securities in addition to buying stripped treasury securities the fund can invest in stripped mortgagerelated securities that are created by segregating the cash flows from underlying mortgage loans or mortgage securities to create two or more new securities each has a specified percentage of the underlying securitys principal or interest payments these are a form of derivative investment mortgage securities may be partially stripped so that each class receives some interest and some principal however they may be completely stripped in that case all of the interest is distributed to holders of one type of    security known as an interestonly security or io and all of the principal is distributed to holders of another type of security known as a principalonly security or po strips can be created for passthrough certificates or collateralized mortgage obligations cmos the yields to maturity of ios and pos are very sensitive to principal repayments including prepayments on the underlying mortgages if the underlying mortgages experience greater than anticipated prepayments of principal the fund might not fully recoup its investment in an io based on those assets if underlying mortgages experience less than anticipated prepayments of principal the yield on the pos based on them could decline substantially floating rate and variable rate obligations the fund can invest in debt securities other than eventlinked bonds that have floating or variable interest rates the interest rates on floating rate obligations change based on changes to a stated prevailing base market interest rate such as a banks prime rate the day us treasury bill rate the rate of return on commercial paper or bank certificates of deposit libor or some other standard the interest rate on a floating rate obligation is adjusted automatically at specified times to give effect to changes in the base rate the interest rate on a variable rate obligation is adjusted at stated periodic intervals to reflect current market interest rates generally the changes in the interest rate on floating and variable rate obligations reduce the fluctuation in their market value so the potential for capital appreciation or depreciation is less than that for comparable fixedrate obligations floating rate and variable rate obligations may have features that permit the holder to recover the principal amount of the security at specified intervals generally not exceeding one year upon notice to the issuer variable rate obligations may have a demand feature that allows the holder to tender the obligation to the issuer or a third party at certain times generally for par value plus accrued interest according to the terms of the obligations the issuer of a demand obligation normally has a corresponding right in its discretion after a given period to prepay the outstanding principal amount of the security plus accrued interest the issuer usually must provide a specified number of days notice to the holder variable rate demand obligations may include master demand notes which are obligations that permit the fund to invest fluctuating amounts in them the credit quality of a floating rate or variable rate obligation may be enhanced by being backed by a letter of credit or guarantee issued by a financial institution corporation the us government or other entity money market instruments the fund can invest in money market instruments which are highquality shortterm debt securities money market instruments in which the fund may invest include shortterm obligations of the us government its agencies or instrumentalities or highquality obligations of domestic and foreign banks and corporations and repurchase agreements relating to these obligations certain money market instruments may be denominated in foreign currencies preferred stock preferred stock has a preference over common stock in liquidation and generally dividends as well but is subordinated to the liabilities of the issuer in all respects as a general rule the market value of preferred stock with a fixed dividend rate and no conversion element varies inversely with interest rates and perceived credit risk while the market price of convertible preferred stock generally also reflects some element of conversion value because preferred stock is junior to debt securities and other obligations of the issuer deterioration in the credit quality of the issuer will cause greater changes in the value of a preferred stock than in a more senior debt security with similar stated yield characteristics unlike interest payments on debt securities even in cases where dividend payments are contractually fixed preferred stock dividends may only be payable if declared by the issuers board preferred stock also may be subject to optional or mandatory redemption provisions unlike common stock or other equity securities preferred securities do not usually have voting rights investment companies and other pooled investment vehicles the fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies that invest primarily in ils which can include openend funds closedend funds limited partnerships unit investment trusts and business development companies the fund may invest in exchange    traded funds etfs which are typically openend funds or unit investment trusts listed on a stock exchange one reason the fund might do so is to gain exposure to segments of the markets represented by another fund at times when the fund might not be able to buy the particular type of securities directly as a shareholder of an investment company the fund would be subject to its ratable share of that investment companys expenses including its advisory and administration expenses the fund does not intend to invest in other investment companies unless the adviser believes that the potential benefits of the investment justify the payment of any premiums or sales charges the funds investments in the securities of other investment companies are subject to the limitations that apply to those types of investments under the  act the fund may invest in the interests of pooled investment vehicles not subject to registration under the  act that invest primarily in ils such interests may have limited or no liquidity and the transfer of such interests may be restricted there can be no assurance of a ready market for resale the fund could find it difficult to sell privately placed securities and other restricted securities when the adviser believes it is desirable to do so especially under adverse market or economic conditions or in the event of adverse changes in the financial condition of the issuer and the prices realized could be less than those originally paid or less than the fair market value at times it also may be difficult to determine the fair value of such securities for purposes of computing the nav of the fund as an investor in such a pooled investment vehicle the fund would be subject to its ratable share of such investment vehicles expenses and fees including management fees and performancerelated fees the fund does not intend to invest in other pooled investment vehicles unless the adviser believes that the potential benefits of the investment justify the payment of the expenses and fees charged by such pooled investment vehicle investment in investment companies and other pooled investment vehicles typically reflects the risks of the underlying portfolio investments of such investment company or other pooled investment vehicle the funds shareholders bear both their proportionate share of the funds expenses and similar expenses of the investment company or other pooled investment vehicle the price and movement of an etf may not track the underlying index and may result in a loss in addition etfs and closedend funds may trade at a price below their net asset value also known as a discount some etfs are not structured as investment companies and thus are not regulated under the  act certain pooled investment vehicles do not have the protections applicable to other types of investments under us federal securities or commodities laws and may be subject to counterparty or credit risk there may be no active market for shares of certain etfs closedend funds or other pooled investment vehicles and such shares may be highly illiquid exchange traded funds the fund may invest in ilsrelated and other etfs etfs such as spdrs ishares and various country index funds are funds whose shares are traded on a national exchange or the national association of securities dealers automated quotation system nasdaq the fund may also invest in nonus etfs such as those listed on the london stock exchanges specialist fund market etfs may be based on underlying equity or fixed income securities spdrs for example seek to provide investment results that generally correspond to the performance of the component common stocks of the sp  etfs do not sell individual shares directly to investors and only issue their shares in large blocks known as creation units the investor purchasing a creation unit then sells the individual shares on a secondary market therefore the liquidity of etfs depends on the adequacy of the secondary market there can be no assurance that an etfs investment objective will be achieved etfs based on an index may not replicate and maintain exactly the composition and relative weightings of securities in the index etfs are subject to the risks of investing in the underlying securities the fund as a holder of the securities of the etf will bear its pro rata portion of the etfs expenses including advisory fees these expenses are in addition to the direct expenses of the funds own operations many etfs have received exemptive orders issued by the sec that would permit the fund to invest in those etfs beyond the limitations applicable to other investment companies subject to certain terms and conditions some etfs are not structured as investment companies and thus are not regulated under the  act certain etfs including leveraged etfs and inverse etfs may have embedded leverage leveraged etfs seek to multiply the return of the tracked index eg twice the return by using various forms of derivative transactions inverse etfs seek to negatively correlate with the performance of a particular index by using various forms of    derivative transactions including by shortselling the underlying index an investment in an inverse etf will decrease in value when the value of the underlying index rises by investing in leveraged etfs or inverse etfs the fund can commit fewer assets to the investment in the securities represented on the index than would otherwise be required leveraged etfs and inverse etfs present all of the risks that regular etfs present in addition leveraged etfs and inverse etfs determine their return over a specific preset time period typically daily and as a result there is no guarantee that the etfs actual long term returns will be equal to the daily return that the fund seeks to achieve for example on a longterm basis eg a period of  months or a year the return of a leveraged etf may in fact be considerably less than two times the longterm return of the tracked index furthermore because leveraged etfs and inverse etfs achieve their results by using derivative instruments they are subject to the risks associated with derivative transactions including the risk that the value of the derivatives may rise or fall more rapidly than other investments thereby causing the etf to lose money and consequently the value of the funds investment to decrease investing in derivative instruments also involves the risk that other parties to the derivative contract may fail to meet their obligations which could cause losses to the etf short sales in particular are subject to the risk that if the price of the security sold short increases the inverse etf may have to cover its short position at a higher price than the short sale price resulting in a loss to the inverse etf and indirectly to the fund an etfs use of these techniques will make the funds investment in the etf more volatile than if the fund were to invest directly in the securities underlying the tracked index or in an etf that does not use leverage or derivative instruments however by investing in a leveraged etf or an inverse etf rather than directly purchasing andor selling derivative instruments the fund will limit its potential loss solely to the amount actually invested in the etf that is the fund will not lose more than the principal amount invested in the etf exchange traded notes the fund may invest in exchange traded notes etns an etn is a type of senior unsecured unsubordinated debt security issued by financial institutions that combines both aspects of bonds and etfs an etns returns are based on the performance of a market index or other reference asset minus fees and expenses similar to etfs etns are listed on an exchange and traded in the secondary market however unlike an etf an etn can be held until the etns maturity at which time the issuer will pay a return linked to the performance of the market index or other reference asset to which the etn is linked minus certain fees unlike regular bonds etns do not make periodic interest payments and principal is not protected an etn that is tied to a specific index may not be able to replicate and maintain exactly the composition and relative weighting of securities commodities or other components in the applicable index etns also incur certain expenses not incurred by their applicable index additionally certain components comprising the index tracked by an etn may at times be temporarily unavailable which may impede an etns ability to track its index some etns that use leverage can at times be relatively illiquid and thus they may be difficult to purchase or sell at a fair price leveraged etns are subject to the same risk as other instruments that use leverage in any form while leverage allows for greater potential return the potential for loss is also greater however the funds potential loss is limited to the amount actually invested in the etn the market value of an etn is influenced by supply and demand for the etn the current performance of the index or other reference asset the credit rating of the etn issuer volatility and lack of liquidity in the reference asset changes in the applicable interest rates and economic legal political or geographic events that affect the reference asset the market value of etn shares may differ from their net asset value this difference in price may be due to the fact that the supply and demand in the market for etn shares at any point in time is not always identical to the supply and demand in the market for the securities underlying the index or other reference asset that the etn seeks to track the value of an etn may also change due to a change in the issuers credit rating as a result there may be times when an etn share trades at a premium or discount to its net asset value the fund will bear its pro rata portion of any fees and expenses borne by the etn these fees and expenses generally reduce the return realized at maturity or upon redemption from an investment in an etn derivatives the fund may enter into derivatives transactions with respect to any security or other instrument in which it is permitted to invest or any related security instrument index or economic indicator reference instruments derivatives are financial instruments the value of which is derived from the underlying reference instrument derivatives transactions can involve substantial risk derivatives typically allow the fund to increase    or decrease the level of risk to which it is exposed more quickly and efficiently than transactions in other types of instruments the fund incurs costs in connection with opening and closing derivatives positions the fund may engage in the derivative transactions set forth below as well as in other derivative transactions with substantially similar characteristics and risks the fund may but is not required to use futures and options on securities indices and currencies forward foreign currency exchange contracts stock index futures swaps including eventlinked swaps and other derivative instruments the fund may use derivatives for a variety of purposes including i as a hedge against adverse changes in the market prices of securities interest rates or to a lesser extent currency exchange rates ii as a substitute for purchasing or selling securities iii to seek to increase the funds return as a nonhedging strategy that may be considered speculative or iv to manage portfolio exposures the use of derivatives gives rise to a form of leverage and the related risks to the extent obligations created by the fund may be deemed to create senior securities the fund will segregate or earmark liquid assets with its custodian in accordance with  act release no  apr   and the guidance of related noaction letters issued by the sec to cover these obligations the use of leverage may cause the fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous to do so to satisfy its obligations or to meet segregation requirements leverage may cause the fund to be more volatile than if it had not been leveraged as certain types of leverage may exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the funds portfolio securities the loss on leverage transactions may substantially exceed the initial investment the fund may obtain eventlinked exposure by investing in among others eventlinked swaps which typically are contingent or formulaically related to defined trigger events or by pursuing similar eventlinked derivative strategies trigger events include hurricanes earthquakes and weatherrelated phenomena if a trigger events occurs the fund may lose the swaps notional amount as derivative instruments eventlinked swaps are subject to risks in addition to the risks of investing in ils including counterparty risk and leverage risk the use of derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the asset index rate or instrument underlying a derivative due to failure of a counterparty or due to tax or regulatory constraints derivatives may create economic leverage in the fund which magnifies the funds exposure to the underlying investment derivatives risk may be more significant when derivatives are used to enhance return or as a substitute for a cash investment position rather than solely to hedge the risk of a position held by the fund when derivatives are used to gain or limit exposure to a particular market or market segment their performance may not correlate as expected to the performance of such market thereby causing the fund to fail to achieve its original purpose for using such derivatives a decision as to whether when and how to use derivatives involves the exercise of specialized skill and judgment and a transaction may be unsuccessful in whole or in part because of market behavior or unexpected events derivative instruments may be difficult to value may be illiquid and may be subject to wide swings in valuation caused by changes in the value of the underlying instrument if a derivatives counterparty is unable to honor its commitments the value of shares may decline and the fund could experience delays in the return of collateral or other assets held by the counterparty and an investor may lose money the loss on derivative transactions may substantially exceed the initial investment options risk a decision as to whether when and how to use options involves the exercise of skill and judgment and even a wellconceived and wellexecuted options program may be adversely affected by market behavior or unexpected events successful options strategies may require the anticipation of future movements in securities prices interest rates and other economic factors no assurances can be given that the advisers judgment in this respect will be correct the trading price of options may be adversely affected if the market for such options becomes less liquid or smaller the fund may close out a written option position by buying the option instead of letting it expire or be exercised similarly the fund may close out a purchased option position by selling the option instead of holding until exercise there can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist when the fund seeks to close out an option position by buying or selling the option reasons for the absence of a liquid secondary market on an exchange include the following i there may be insufficient trading interest in certain options ii restrictions    may be imposed by an exchange on opening transactions or closing transactions or both iii trading halts suspensions or other restrictions may be imposed with respect to particular classes or series of options iv unusual or unforeseen circumstances may interrupt normal operations on an exchange v the facilities of an exchange or a market clearinghouse may not at all times be adequate to handle current trading volume or vi a regulator or one or more exchanges could for economic or other reasons decide to discontinue the trading of options or a particular class or series of options at some future date if trading were discontinued the secondary market on that exchange or in that class or series of options would cease to exist there are significant differences between securities and options markets that could result in an imperfect correlation between these markets causing a given transaction not to achieve its objectives hedging although it is not obligated to do so the fund can use derivatives to hedge the fund can use hedging to attempt to protect against declines in the market value of the funds portfolio to permit the fund to retain unrealized gains in the value of portfolio securities which have appreciated or to facilitate selling securities for investment reasons the fund can use hedging to establish a position in the securities market as a temporary substitute for purchasing particular securities in that case the fund would normally seek to purchase the securities and then terminate that hedging position the fund might also use this type of hedge to attempt to protect against the possibility that their portfolio securities would not be fully included in a rise in value of the market some of the hedging strategies the fund can use are described below the fund may employ new hedging strategies when they are developed if those investment methods are consistent with the funds investment objective and are permissible under applicable regulations governing the fund structured notes the fund can invest in structured notes which are speciallydesigned derivative debt investments whose principal payments or interest payments are linked to the value of an underlying asset such as an equity or debt security currency or commodity or nonasset reference such as an interest rate or index the terms of the instrument may be structured by the purchaser the fund and the borrower issuing the note the values of these notes will fall or rise in response to changes in the values of the underlying asset or reference and the fund might receive less principal or interest if the underlying asset or reference does not perform as anticipated in some cases these notes may pay an amount based on a multiple of the relative change in value of the asset or reference this type of note offers the potential for increased income or principal payments but at a greater risk of loss than a typical debt security of the same maturity and credit quality the values of these notes are also subject to both credit risk if the counterparty fails to meet its obligations and interest rate risk and therefore the fund could receive more or less than they originally invested when a note matures the prices of these notes may be very volatile and they may have a limited trading market making it difficult for the fund to value them or sell them at an acceptable price swaps the fund may enter into ilsrelated and other swap agreements including interest rate total return credit default and volatility swaps swap agreements are twoparty contracts entered into primarily by institutional investors for a specified period of time typically ranging from a few weeks to more than one year in a standard swap transaction two parties agree to exchange the returns or the difference between the returns earned or realized on a particular asset such as an equity or debt security commodity or currency or nonasset reference such as an interest rate or index the swapped returns are generally calculated with respect to a notional amount that is the return on a particular dollar amount invested in the underlying asset or reference the fund may enter into swap agreements to among other reasons gain exposure to certain markets in the most economical way possible protect against currency fluctuations or reduce risk arising from ownership of a particular security or instrument the success of swap agreements is dependent on the advisers ability to predict correctly whether certain types of investments are likely to produce greater returns than other investments other risks include liquidity and counterparty risk    the fund may enter into swap transactions with certain counterparties pursuant to master netting agreements a master netting agreement provides that all swaps done between the fund and that counterparty shall be regarded as parts of an integral agreement if amounts are payable on a particular date in the same currency in respect of more than one swap transaction the amount payable shall be the net amount in addition the master netting agreement may provide that if one party defaults generally or on any swap the counterparty can terminate all outstanding swaps with that party the use of swap agreements by the fund entails certain risks the swaps market is generally unregulated there is no central exchange or market for swap transactions and therefore they are less liquid investments than exchangetraded instruments and may be considered illiquid by the fund swap agreements entail credit risk arising from the possibility that the counterparty will default if the counterparty defaults the funds loss will consist of the net amount of contractual payments that the fund has not yet received the adviser will monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties to the funds swap transactions on an ongoing basis the funds successful use of swap agreements is dependent upon the advisers ability to predict correctly whether certain types of investments are likely to produce greater returns than other investments swap agreements may effectively add leverage to the funds portfolio because the fund would be subject to investment exposure on the notional amount of the swap interest rate swaps the fund may enter into interest rate swaps in an interest rate swap the fund and another party exchange the right to receive or the obligation to pay interest on a security or other reference rate for example they might swap the right to receive floating rate payments for fixed rate payments there is a risk that based on movements of interest rates the payments made by the fund under a swap agreement will be greater than the payments it receives total return swaps the fund may enter into total return swaps under which one party agrees to pay the other the total return of a defined underlying asset such as a security or basket of securities or nonasset reference such as a catastrophe insurance or securities index during the specified period in return for periodic payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate or the total return from different underlying assets or references total return swaps could result in losses if the underlying asset or reference does not perform as anticipated by the advisers credit default swaps the fund may enter into credit default swaps a credit default swap enables an investor to buy or sell protection against a credit event such as a borrowers or issuers failure to make timely payments of interest or principal bankruptcy or restructuring the fund may seek to enhance returns by selling protection or attempt to mitigate credit risk by buying protection against the occurrence of a credit event by a specified borrower or issuer the fund may enter into credit default swaps both directly unfunded swaps and indirectly funded swaps in the form of a swap embedded within a structured security unfunded and funded credit default swaps may refer to a single security or on a basket of securities        if the fund buys credit protection using a credit default swap and a credit event occurs the fund will deliver the defaulted bond underlying the swap and the swap counterparty will pay the par amount of the bond if the fund sells credit protection using a credit default swap and a credit event occurs the fund will pay the par amount of the defaulted bond underlying the swap and the swap counterparty will deliver the bond if the swap is on a basket of assets the notional amount of the swap is reduced by the par amount of the defaulted asset and the fixed payments are then made on the reduced notional amount        risks of credit default swaps include counterparty credit risk if the counterparty fails to meet its obligations and the risk that the fund will not properly assess the cost of the instrument based on the lack of transparency in the market if the fund is selling credit protection there is a risk that a credit event will occur and that the fund will have to pay par value on defaulted bonds if the fund is buying credit protection there is a risk that no credit event will occur and the fund will receive no benefit for      the premium paid in addition if the fund is buying credit protection and a credit event does occur there is a risk when the fund does not own the underlying asset that the fund will have difficulty acquiring the asset on the open market and may receive adverse pricing foreign currency swaps foreign currency swaps involve the exchange by the lenders including the fund with another party the counterparty of the right to receive the currency in which the loans are denominated for the right to receive us dollars the fund will enter into a foreign currency swap only if the outstanding debt obligations of the counterparty are rated investment grade quality by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization at the time of entering into such transaction or whose creditworthiness is believed by the funds adviser to be equivalent to such rating the amounts of us dollar payments to be received by the fund and the foreign currency payments to be received by the counterparty are fixed at the time the swap arrangement is entered into accordingly the swap is designed to protect the fund from the fluctuations in exchange rates and locks in the right to receive payment under the loan in a predetermined amount of us dollars if there is a default by the counterparty the fund will have contractual remedies pursuant to the swap agreement however the us dollar value of the funds right to receive foreign currency payments under the obligation will be subject to fluctuations in the applicable exchange rate to the extent that a replacement swap arrangement is unavailable or the fund is unable to recover damages from the defaulting counterparty cross currency interest rate swaps cross currency interest rate swaps combine features of currency swaps and interest rate swaps the cross currency interest rate swaps in which the fund may enter generally will involve both the exchange of currency and the payment of interest streams with reference to one currency based on a specified index in exchange for receiving interest streams with reference to the other currency such swaps may involve initial and final exchanges that correspond to the agreed upon transaction amount for example the payment stream on a specified amount of euro based on a european market floating rate might be exchanged for a us oriented floating rate on the same principal amount converted into us dollars volatility swap contracts the fund may enter into volatility swaps to hedge the direction of volatility in a particular asset or nonasset reference or for other nonspeculative purposes for volatility swaps counterparties agree to buy or sell volatility at a specific level over a fixed period volatility swaps are subject to credit risks if the counterparty fails to meet its obligations and the risk that the adviser is incorrect in forecasts of volatility of the underlying asset or reference swap options and swap forwards the fund also may enter into options on swaps as well as forwards on swaps a swap option is a contract that gives a counterparty the right but not the obligation to enter into a new swap agreement or to shorten extend cancel or otherwise modify an existing swap agreement on predesignated terms the fund may write sell and purchase put and call swap options a swap forward is an agreement to enter into a swap agreement at some point in the future usually three to six months from the date of the contract the writer of the contract receives the premium and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the preset rate on the underlying swap the fund generally will incur a greater risk when it writes a swap option than when it purchases a swap option when the fund purchases a swap option it risks losing only the amount of the premium they have paid if the fund lets the option expire unexercised when the fund writes a swap option it will become obligated upon exercise of the option by the counterparty according to the terms of the underlying agreement futures the fund can buy and sell futures contracts that relate to debt securities these are referred to as interest rate futures broadlybased securities indices stock index futures and bond index futures foreign currencies commodities and an individual stock single stock futures    a broadlybased stock index is used as the basis for trading stock index futures they may in some cases be based on stocks of issuers in a particular industry or group of industries a stock index assigns relative values to the securities included in the index and its value fluctuates in response to the changes in value of the underlying securities a stock index cannot be purchased or sold directly bond index futures are similar contracts based on the future value of the basket of securities that comprise the index these contracts obligate the seller to deliver and the purchaser to take cash to settle the futures transaction there is no delivery made of the underlying securities to settle the futures obligation either party may also settle the transaction by entering into an offsetting contract an interest rate future obligates the seller to deliver and the purchaser to take cash or a specified type of debt security to settle the futures transaction either party could also enter into an offsetting contract to close out the position similarly a single stock future obligates the seller to deliver and the purchaser to take cash or a specified equity security to settle the futures transaction either party could also enter into an offsetting contract to close out the position single stock futures trade on a very limited number of exchanges with contracts typically not fungible among the exchanges no money is paid or received by the fund on the purchase or sale of a future upon entering into a futures transaction the fund will be required to deposit an initial margin payment with the futures commission merchant the futures broker initial margin payments will be deposited with the funds custodian bank in an account registered in the futures brokers name however the futures broker can gain access to that account only under specified conditions as the future is marked to market that is its value on the funds books is changed to reflect changes in its market value subsequent margin payments called variation margin will be paid to or by the futures broker daily at any time prior to expiration of the future the fund may elect to close out its position by taking an opposite position at which time a final determination of variation margin is made and any additional cash must be paid by or released to the fund any loss or gain on the future is then realized by the fund for tax purposes all futures transactions except forward contracts are effected through a clearinghouse associated with the exchange on which the contracts are traded put and call options the fund can buy and sell exchangetraded and overthecounter put options puts and call options calls including index options securities options currency options commodities options and options on futures writing call options the fund may write that is sell calls if the fund sells a call option it must be covered that means the fund must own the security subject to the call while the call is outstanding or the call must be covered by segregating liquid assets to enable the fund to satisfy its obligations if the call is exercised there is no limit on the amount of the funds total assets that may be subject to covered calls the fund writes when the fund writes a call on a security it receives cash a premium the fund agrees to sell the underlying security to a purchaser of a corresponding call on the same security during the call period at a fixed exercise price regardless of market price changes during the call period the call period is usually not more than nine months the exercise price may differ from the market price of the underlying security the fund has the risk of loss that the price of the underlying security may decline during the call period that risk may be offset to some extent by the premium the fund receives if the value of the investment does not rise above the call price it is likely that the call will lapse without being exercised in that case the fund would keep the cash premium and the investment when the fund writes a call on an index it receives cash a premium if the buyer of the call exercises it the fund will pay an amount of cash equal to the difference between the closing price of the call and the exercise price multiplied by a specific multiple that determines the total value of the call for each point of    difference if the value of the underlying investment does not rise above the call price it is likely that the call will lapse without being exercised in that case the fund would keep the cash premium the funds custodian bank or a securities depository acting for the custodian will act as the funds escrow agent through the facilities of the options clearing corporation occ as to the investments on which the fund have written calls traded on exchanges or as to other acceptable escrow securities in that way no margin will be required for such transactions occ will release the securities on the expiration of the option or when the fund enters into a closing transaction when the fund writes an overthecounter otc option it will enter into an arrangement with a primary us government securities dealer which will establish a formula price at which the fund will have the absolute right to repurchase that otc option the formula price will generally be based on a multiple of the premium received for the option plus the amount by which the option is exercisable below the market price of the underlying security ie the option is inthemoney to terminate its obligation on a call it has written the fund may purchase a corresponding call in a closing purchase transaction the fund will then realize a profit or loss depending upon whether the net of the amount of the option transaction costs and the premium received on the call the fund wrote is more or less than the price of the call the fund purchases to close out the transaction the fund may realize a profit if the call expires unexercised because the fund will retain the underlying security and the premium it received when it wrote the call any such profits are considered shortterm capital gains for federal income tax purposes as are the premiums on lapsed calls if the fund cannot effect a closing purchase transaction due to the lack of a market it will have to hold the callable securities until the call expires or is exercised the fund may also write calls on a futures contract without owning the futures contract or securities deliverable under the contract to do so at the time the call is written the fund must cover the call by segregating an equivalent dollar amount of liquid assets as identified in the funds books because of this segregation requirement in no circumstances would the funds receipt of an exercise notice as to that future require the fund to deliver a futures contract it would simply put the fund in a short futures position writing put options the fund may write that is sell put options a put option on securities gives the purchaser the right to sell and the writer the obligation to buy the underlying investment at the exercise price during the option period if the fund writes a put the fund must segregate or earmark liquid assets as discussed above the premium the fund receives from writing a put represents a profit as long as the price of the underlying investment remains equal to or above the exercise price however the fund also assumes the obligation during the option period to buy the underlying investment from the buyer of the put at the exercise price even if the value of the investment falls below the exercise price if a put the fund has written expires unexercised the fund realizes a gain in the amount of the premium less the transaction costs incurred if the put is exercised the fund must fulfill its obligation to purchase the underlying investment at the exercise price that price will usually exceed the market value of the investment at that time in that case the fund may incur a loss if it sells the underlying investment that loss will be equal to the sum of the sale price of the underlying investment and the premium received minus the sum of the exercise price and any transaction costs the fund incurred when writing a put option on a security to secure its obligation to pay for the underlying security the fund will deposit in escrow liquid assets with a value equal to or greater than the exercise price of the underlying securities the fund therefore forgoes the opportunity of investing the segregated assets or writing calls against those assets    as long as the funds obligation as the put writer continues it may be assigned an exercise notice by the brokerdealer through which the put was sold that notice will require the fund to take delivery of the underlying security and pay the exercise price the fund has no control over when it may be required to purchase the underlying security since it may be assigned an exercise notice at any time prior to the termination of its obligation as the writer of the put that obligation terminates upon expiration of the put it may also terminate if before it receives an exercise notice the fund effects a closing purchase transaction by purchasing a put of the same series as it sold once the fund has been assigned an exercise notice it cannot effect a closing purchase transaction the fund may decide to effect a closing purchase transaction to realize a profit on an outstanding put option it has written or to prevent the underlying security from being put effecting a closing purchase transaction will also permit the fund to write another put option on the security or to sell the security and use the proceeds from the sale for other investments the fund will realize a profit or loss from a closing purchase transaction depending on whether the cost of the transaction is less or more than the premium received from writing the put option any profits from writing puts are considered shortterm capital gains for federal tax purposes purchasing puts and calls the fund may purchase call options when the fund buys a call other than in a closing purchase transaction it pays a premium the fund then has the right to buy the underlying investment from a seller of a corresponding call on the same investment during the call period at a fixed exercise price the fund benefits only if it sells the call at a profit or if during the call period the market price of the underlying investment is above the sum of the call price plus the transaction costs and the premium paid for the call and the fund exercises the call if the fund does not exercise the call or sell it whether or not at a profit the call will become worthless at its expiration date in that case the fund will have paid the premium but lost the right to purchase the underlying investment the fund can buy puts whether or not it owns the underlying investment when the fund purchases a put it pays a premium and except as to puts on indices has the right to sell the underlying investment to a seller of a put on a corresponding investment during the put period at a fixed exercise price buying a put on an investment the fund does not own such as an index or a future permits the fund either to resell the put or to buy the underlying investment and sell it at the exercise price the resale price will vary inversely to the price of the underlying investment if the market price of the underlying investment is above the exercise price and as a result the put is not exercised the put will become worthless on its expiration date buying a put on securities or futures the fund owns enables the fund to attempt to protect itself during the put period against a decline in the value of the underlying investment below the exercise price by selling the underlying investment at the exercise price to a seller of a corresponding put if the market price of the underlying investment is equal to or above the exercise price and as a result the put is not exercised or resold the put will become worthless at its expiration date in that case the fund will have paid the premium but lost the right to sell the underlying investment however the fund may sell the put prior to its expiration that sale may or may not be at a profit when the fund purchases a call or put on an index or future it pays a premium but settlement is in cash rather than by delivery of the underlying investment to the fund gain or loss depends on changes in the index in question and thus on price movements in the securities market generally rather than on price movements in individual securities or futures contracts    buying and selling options on foreign currencies the fund can buy and sell exchangetraded and overthecounter put options and call options on foreign currencies the fund could use these calls and puts to try to protect against declines in the dollar value of foreign securities and increases in the dollar cost of foreign securities the fund wants to acquire if the adviser anticipates a rise in the dollar value of a foreign currency in which securities to be acquired are denominated the increased cost of those securities may be partially offset by purchasing calls or writing puts on that foreign currency if the adviser anticipates a decline in the dollar value of a foreign currency the decline in the dollar value of portfolio securities denominated in that currency might be partially offset by writing calls or purchasing puts on that foreign currency however the currency rates could fluctuate in a direction adverse to the funds position the fund will then have incurred option premium payments and transaction costs without a corresponding benefit a call the fund writes on a foreign currency is covered if the fund owns the underlying foreign currency covered by the call or has an absolute and immediate right to acquire that foreign currency without additional cash consideration or it can do so for additional cash consideration held in a segregated account by its custodian bank upon conversion or exchange of other foreign currency held in its portfolio the fund could write a call on a foreign currency to provide a hedge against a decline in the us dollar value of a security which the fund owns or has the right to acquire and which is denominated in the currency underlying the option that decline might be one that occurs due to an expected adverse change in the exchange rate this is known as a crosshedging strategy in those circumstances the fund covers the option by maintaining cash us government securities or other liquid high grade debt securities in an amount equal to the exercise price of the option in a segregated account with the funds custodian bank risks of hedging with options and futures the use of hedging strategies requires special skills and knowledge of investment techniques that are different than what is required for normal portfolio management if the adviser uses a hedging strategy at the wrong time or judges market conditions incorrectly hedging strategies may reduce the funds return the fund could also experience losses if the prices of its futures and options positions were not correlated with its other investments the funds option activities could affect its portfolio turnover rate and brokerage commissions the exercise of calls written by the fund might cause the fund to sell related portfolio securities thus increasing its turnover rate the exercise by the fund of puts on securities will cause the sale of underlying investments increasing portfolio turnover although the decision whether to exercise a put it holds is within the funds control holding a put might cause the fund to sell the related investments for reasons that would not exist in the absence of the put the fund could pay a brokerage commission each time it buys a call or put sells a call or put or buys or sells an underlying investment in connection with the exercise of a call or put those commissions could be higher on a relative basis than the commissions for direct purchases or sales of the underlying investments premiums paid for options are small in relation to the market value of the underlying investments consequently put and call options offer large amounts of leverage the leverage offered by trading in options could result in the funds net asset value being more sensitive to changes in the value of the underlying investment if a covered call written by the fund is exercised on an investment that has increased in value the fund will be required to sell the investment at the call price it will not be able to realize any profit if the investment has increased in value above the call price an option position may be closed out only on a market that provides secondary trading for options of the same series and there is no assurance that a liquid secondary market will exist for any particular option the fund might experience losses if it could not close out a position because of an illiquid market for the future or option    there is a risk in using short hedging by selling futures or purchasing puts on broadlybased indices or futures to attempt to protect against declines in the value of the funds portfolio securities the risk is that the prices of the futures or the applicable index will correlate imperfectly with the behavior of the cash prices of the funds securities for example it is possible that while the fund has used derivative instruments in a short hedge the market may advance and the value of the securities held in the funds portfolio might decline if that occurred the fund would lose money on the derivative instruments and also experience a decline in the value of its portfolio securities however while this could occur for a very brief period or to a very small degree over time the value of a diversified portfolio of securities will tend to move in the same direction as the indices upon which the derivative instruments are based the risk of imperfect correlation increases as the composition of the funds portfolio diverges from the securities included in the applicable index to compensate for the imperfect correlation of movements in the price of the portfolio securities being hedged and movements in the price of the hedging instruments the fund might use derivative instruments in a greater dollar amount than the dollar amount of portfolio securities being hedged it might do so if the historical volatility of the prices of the portfolio securities being hedged is more than the historical volatility of the applicable index the ordinary spreads between prices in the cash and futures markets are subject to distortions due to differences in the nature of those markets first all participants in the futures market are subject to margin deposit and maintenance requirements rather than meeting additional margin deposit requirements investors may close futures contracts through offsetting transactions which could distort the normal relationship between the cash and futures markets second the liquidity of the futures market depends on participants entering into offsetting transactions rather than making or taking delivery to the extent participants decide to make or take delivery liquidity in the futures market could be reduced thus producing distortion third from the point of view of speculators the deposit requirements in the futures market are less onerous than margin requirements in the securities markets therefore increased participation by speculators in the futures market may cause temporary price distortions the fund can use derivative instruments to establish a position in the securities markets as a temporary substitute for the purchase of individual securities long hedging by buying futures andor calls on such futures broadlybased indices or on securities it is possible that when the fund does so the market might decline if the fund then concludes not to invest in securities because of concerns that the market might decline further or for other reasons the fund will realize a loss on the hedge position that is not offset by a reduction in the price of the securities purchased forward contracts forward contracts are foreign currency exchange contracts they are used to buy or sell foreign currency for future delivery at a fixed price the fund can use them to lock in the us dollar price of a security denominated in a foreign currency that the fund has bought or sold or to protect against possible losses from changes in the relative values of the us dollar and a foreign currency the fund can also use crosshedging where the fund hedges against changes in currencies other than the currency in which a security it holds is denominated under a forward contract one party agrees to purchase and another party agrees to sell a specific currency at a future date that date may be any fixed number of days from the date of the contract agreed upon by the parties the transaction price is set at the time the contract is entered into these contracts are traded in the interbank market conducted directly among currency traders usually large commercial banks and their customers the fund may use forward contracts to protect against uncertainty in the level of future exchange rates the use of forward contracts does not eliminate the risk of fluctuations in the prices of the underlying securities the fund own or intend to acquire but it does fix a rate of exchange in advance although forward contracts may reduce the risk of loss from a decline in the value of the hedged currency at the same time they limit any potential gain if the value of the hedged currency increases    when the fund enters into a contract for the purchase or sale of a security denominated in a foreign currency or when it anticipates receiving dividend payments in a foreign currency the fund might desire to lockin the us dollar price of the security or the us dollar equivalent of the dividend payments to do so the fund could enter into a forward contract for the purchase or sale of the amount of foreign currency involved in the underlying transaction in a fixed amount of us dollars per unit of the foreign currency this is called a transaction hedge the transaction hedge will protect the fund against a loss from an adverse change in the currency exchange rates during the period between the date on which the security is purchased or sold or on which the payment is declared and the date on which the payments are made or received the fund could also use forward contracts to lock in the us dollar value of portfolio positions this is called a position hedge when the fund believes that a foreign currency might suffer a substantial decline against the us dollar it could enter into a forward contract to sell an amount of that foreign currency approximating the value of some or all of the funds portfolio securities denominated in that foreign currency when the fund believes that the us dollar might suffer a substantial decline against a foreign currency it could enter into a forward contract to buy that foreign currency for a fixed dollar amount alternatively the fund could enter into a forward contract to sell a different foreign currency for a fixed us dollar amount if the fund believes that the us dollar value of the foreign currency to be sold pursuant to its forward contract will fall whenever there is a decline in the us dollar value of the currency in which portfolio securities of the fund are denominated that is referred to as a cross hedge the fund will not enter into forward contracts or maintain a net exposure to such contracts if the consummation of the contracts would obligate the fund to deliver an amount of foreign currency in excess of the value of the funds portfolio securities or other assets denominated in that currency or another currency that is the subject of the hedge however to avoid excess transactions and transaction costs the fund may maintain a net exposure to forward contracts in excess of the value of the funds portfolio securities or other assets denominated in foreign currencies if the excess amount is covered by liquid securities denominated in any currency the cover must be at least equal at all times to the amount of that excess as one alternative the fund may purchase a call option permitting the fund to purchase the amount of foreign currency being hedged by a forward sale contract at a price no higher than the forward contract price as another alternative the fund may purchase a put option permitting the fund to sell the amount of foreign currency subject to a forward purchase contract at a price as high or higher than the forward contract price the precise matching of the amounts under forward contracts and the value of the securities involved generally will not be possible because the future value of securities denominated in foreign currencies will change as a consequence of market movements between the date the forward contract is entered into and the date it is sold in some cases the adviser might decide to sell the security and deliver foreign currency to settle the original purchase obligation if the market value of the security is less than the amount of foreign currency the fund is obligated to deliver the fund might have to purchase additional foreign currency on the spot that is cash market to settle the security trade if the market value of the security instead exceeds the amount of foreign currency the fund is obligated to deliver to settle the trade the fund might have to sell on the spot market some of the foreign currency received upon the sale of the security there will be additional transaction costs on the spot market in those cases the projection of shortterm currency market movements is extremely difficult and the successful execution of a shortterm hedging strategy is highly uncertain forward contracts involve the risk that anticipated currency movements will not be accurately predicted causing the fund to sustain losses on these contracts and to pay additional transactions costs the use of forward contracts in this manner might reduce the funds performance if there are unanticipated changes in currency prices to a greater degree than if the fund had not entered into such contracts    at or before the maturity of a forward contract requiring the fund to sell a currency the fund might sell a portfolio security and use the sale proceeds to make delivery of the currency in the alternative the fund might retain the security and offset its contractual obligation to deliver the currency by purchasing a second contract under that contract the fund will obtain on the same maturity date the same amount of the currency that it is obligated to deliver similarly the fund might close out a forward contract requiring it to purchase a specified currency by entering into a second contract entitling it to sell the same amount of the same currency on the maturity date of the first contract the fund would realize a gain or loss as a result of entering into such an offsetting forward contract under either circumstance the gain or loss will depend on the extent to which the exchange rate or rates between the currencies involved moved between the execution dates of the first contract and offsetting contract the costs to the fund of engaging in forward contracts varies with factors such as the currencies involved the length of the contract period and the market conditions then prevailing because forward contracts are usually entered into on a principal basis no brokerage fees or commissions are involved because these contracts are not traded on an exchange the fund must evaluate the credit and performance risk of the counterparty under each forward contract although the fund values its assets daily in terms of us dollars it does not intend to convert its holdings of foreign currencies into us dollars on a daily basis the fund may convert foreign currency from time to time and will incur costs in doing so foreign exchange dealers do not charge a fee for conversion but they do seek to realize a profit based on the difference between the prices at which they buy and sell various currencies thus a dealer might offer to sell a foreign currency to one fund at one rate while offering a lesser rate of exchange if the fund desires to resell that currency to the dealer legislation and regulation risks of certain derivative instruments legislation regarding regulation of the financial sector including the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act which was signed into law in july  will change the way in which certain derivative instruments are regulated andor traded such regulation may impact the availability liquidity and cost of derivative instruments while many provisions of the doddfrank act must be implemented through future rulemaking and any regulatory or legislative activity may not necessarily have a direct immediate effect upon the fund it is possible that upon implementation of these measures or any future measures they could potentially limit or completely restrict the ability of the fund to use certain derivative instruments as a part of its investment strategy increase the costs of using these instruments or make them less effective limits or restrictions applicable to the counterparties with which the fund engages in derivatives transactions could also prevent the fund from using these instruments or affect the pricing or other factors relating to these instruments or may change the availability of certain investments there can be no assurance that such legislation or regulation will not have a material adverse effect on the fund or will not impair the ability of the fund to utilize certain derivatives transactions or achieve its investment objectives amended commodity futures trading commission cftc rule  permits investment advisers to registered investment companies to claim an exclusion from the definition of commodity pool operator under the commodity exchange act cea with respect to a fund provided certain requirements are met in order to permit the adviser to claim this exclusion with respect to the fund the fund will limit its transactions in futures options on futures and swaps excluding transactions entered into for bona fide hedging purposes as defined under cftc regulations such that either i the aggregate initial margin and premiums required to establish its futures options on futures and swaps do not exceed  of the liquidation value of the funds portfolio after taking into account unrealized profits and losses on such positions or ii the aggregate net notional value of its futures options on futures and swaps does not exceed  of the liquidation value of the funds portfolio after taking into account unrealized profits and losses on such positions accordingly the fund is not subject to regulation under the cea or otherwise regulated by the cftc if the adviser was unable to claim the exclusion with respect to the fund the adviser would become subject to registration and regulation as a commodity pool operator which would subject the adviser and the fund to additional registration and regulatory requirements and increased operating expenses    tax aspects of certain derivative instruments certain foreign currency exchange contracts in which the fund may invest are treated as section  contracts under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code in general gains or losses relating to section  contracts are characterized as  longterm and  shortterm capital gains or losses under the code however foreign currency gains or losses arising from section  contracts that are forward contracts generally are treated as ordinary income or loss in addition section  contracts held by the fund at the end of each taxable year are markedtomarket and unrealized gains or losses are treated as though they were realized an election can be made by the fund to exempt those transactions from this marktomarket treatment certain forward contracts the fund enters into may result in straddles for federal income tax purposes the straddle rules may affect the character and timing of gains or losses recognized by the fund on straddle positions generally a loss sustained on the disposition of a position making up a straddle is allowed only to the extent that the loss exceeds any unrecognized gain in the offsetting positions making up the straddle disallowed loss is generally allowed at the point where there is no unrecognized gain in the offsetting positions making up the straddle or the offsetting position is disposed of under the code the following gains or losses are treated as ordinary income or loss      gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates that occur between the time the fund accrues interest or other receivables or accrues expenses or other liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and the time the fund actually collects such receivables or pays such liabilities and      gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in the value of a foreign currency between the date of acquisition of a debt security denominated in a foreign currency or foreign currency forward contracts and the date of disposition currency gains and losses are offset against market gains and losses on each trade before determining a net section  gain or loss under the code for that trade which may increase or decrease the amount of the funds investment income available for distribution to its shareholders credit and collateral risk ils in which the fund invests will be subject to credit risk the principal invested in an ils may be held by the spv in a collateral account and invested in various permissible assets set forth under the terms of the spv typically the collateral account is invested in highquality us government securities ie us treasury bonds however in certain ils the collateral account may be invested in highyielding higherrisk securities in such instances the fund will be subject to the risk of nonpayment of scheduled principal and interest on such collateral account investments such nonpayments and defaults may reduce the income to the fund from the collateral account and negatively impact the value of fund shares in addition the collateral will be invested in accordance with the terms of the spv and overseen by a collateral manager appointed by the spv and therefore the fund is dependent upon the manager to invest the collateral account proceeds appropriately there is no guarantee that the value of the collateral in the collateral account will equal the principal amount of the security either upon the purchase sale or maturity of the ils below investment grade securities risk the fund can invest without limit in ils that are rated below investment grade commonly called junk bonds which are bonds rated below bbb by sp or baa by moodys investors service inc moodys or that have comparable ratings by another rating organization the rating primarily reflects the rating agencys calculated probability that a predefined trigger event will occur therefore securities with a lower rating reflect the rating agencys assessment of the substantial risk that a trigger event will occur and result in a loss the rating also assesses the ils credit risk and the model used to calculate the probability of the trigger event the rating system for ils is relatively new and significantly less developed than that of corporate bonds and continues to evolve as the market develops most rating agencies rely upon one or more of the reports prepared by the following three independent catastrophe modeling firms air worldwide corporation eqecat inc and risk management solutions inc one or more of these modeling firms may be used by the adviser as part of its investment process these firms utilize different methodologies to    evaluate the probability of various types of predefined trigger events if the reports used by the rating agency are flawed it may cause a rating agency to assign a rating to an ils that is not justified therefore to the extent the adviser relies on rating agency ratings to select securities for the fund the fund may be exposed to greater risks additionally because there are only three major independent catastrophe modeling firms the effects of a flawed model or report issued by one or more of such firms will be magnified the fund may also invest in ils that are unrated and determined by the adviser to be of below investment grade quality credit management the fund may invest in securities and other obligations of any credit quality including those that are rated below investment grade debt securities rated below investment grade are commonly referred to as junk bonds or are unrated but determined by the adviser to be of equivalent credit quality and those that are in default or in bankruptcy because ils are typically rated below investment grade or unrated a substantial portion of the funds assets ordinarily will consist of below investment grade securities an investor can lose a significant amount whether investing in investment grade below investment grade or unrated securities the fund does not have a policy of maintaining a specific average credit quality of its portfolio the adviser monitors the credit quality and price of the securities and other instruments held by the fund interest rate risk interest rate risk refers to the fluctuations in value of debt instruments resulting from the inverse relationship between price and yield during periods of declining interest rates the market price of fixed income instruments generally rises conversely during periods of rising interest rates the market price of such instruments generally declines the magnitude of these fluctuations in the market price of fixed income instruments is generally greater for instruments with longer maturities because such instruments do not mature reset interest rates or become callable for longer periods of time the fund does not have investment policies establishing specific maturity ranges for their investments and they may be within any maturity range short medium or long depending on the advisers evaluation of investment opportunities available within the debt securities markets because the interest rates on floating rate bonds adjust periodically to reflect current market rates falling shortterm interest rates should tend to decrease the income payable to the fund on their floating rate investments and rising rates should tend to increase that income however investments in floating rate and variable rate obligations should also mitigate the fluctuations in the funds net asset values during periods of changing interest rates compared to changes in values of fixedrate debt securities nevertheless changes in interest rates can affect the value of the funds floating rate investments especially if rates change sharply in a short period because the resets of the interest rates on the investments occur periodically and will not all happen simultaneously with changes in prevailing rates having a shorter average reset period for their portfolio of investments may help mitigate that risk nonus investments the fund may invest in ils issued by foreign sovereigns and foreign entities that are corporations partnerships trusts or other types of business entities because the majority of ils issuers are domiciled outside the united states the fund will normally invest significant amounts of its assets in nonus entities accordingly the fund may invest without limitation in securities issued by nonus entities including those in emerging market countries certain spvs in which the fund invests may be sponsored by nonus ceding insurers that are not subject to the same regulation as that to which us ceding insurers are subject such spvs may pose a greater risk of loss for example due to less stringent underwriting andor riskretention requirements the funds investments will consist primarily of eventlinked bonds and structured reinsurance investments which provide the fund with contractual rights under the terms of the issuance while the contractual rights of eventlinked bonds and structured reinsurance investments issued are similar whether they are issued by a us issuer or a nonus issuer there may be certain additional risks associated with nonus issuers for example foreign issuers could be affected by factors not present in the us including expropriation confiscatory taxation lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards less publicly available financial and other information potential difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and increased costs to enforce applicable contractual obligations outside the us settlements of securities transactions in foreign countries are subject to risk of loss may be delayed and are generally less frequent than in the us which could affect the    liquidity of the funds assets the risks of investing in securities of nonus issuers generally or in issuers with significant exposure to nonus markets may be related among other things to differences in size liquidity and volatility of and the degree and manner of regulation of the securities markets of certain nonus markets compared to the securities markets in the us as well as economic political and social factors foreign currency risk it is expected that a substantial portion of the funds investments in ils will be us dollar denominated investments to the extent the fund invests in nonus denominated instruments a change in the value of a foreign currency against the us dollar will result in a change in the us dollar value of securities denominated in that foreign currency if the us dollar rises in value against a foreign currency a security denominated in that currency will be worth less in us dollars and if the us dollar decreases in value against a foreign currency a security denominated in that currency will be worth more in us dollars the dollar value of foreign investments may also be affected by exchange controls foreign government debt obligations the debt obligations of foreign governments and entities may or may not be supported by the full faith and credit of the foreign government the fund may buy securities issued by certain supranational entities which include entities designated or supported by governments to promote economic reconstruction or development international banking organizations and related government agencies the governmental members of these supranational entities are stockholders that typically make capital contributions and may be committed to make additional capital contributions if the entity is unable to repay its borrowings a supranational entitys lending activities may be limited to a percentage of its total capital reserves and net income there can be no assurance that the constituent foreign governments will continue to be able or willing to honor their capitalization commitments for those entities investments in emerging markets the fund may invest in securities of issuers in countries with emerging economies or securities markets the fund will generally focus on emerging markets that do not impose unusual trading requirements which tend to restrict the flow of investments in addition the fund may invest in unquoted securities of emerging market issuers custodial services and related investment costs custodial services and other costs relating to investment in international securities markets generally are more expensive than in the us such markets have settlement and clearance procedures that differ from those in the us in certain markets there have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions making it difficult to conduct such transactions the inability of the fund to make intended securities purchases due to settlement problems could cause the fund to miss attractive investment opportunities the inability to dispose of a portfolio security caused by settlement problems could result either in losses to the fund due to a subsequent decline in value of the portfolio security or could result in possible liability to the fund in addition security settlement and clearance procedures in some emerging market countries may not fully protect the fund against the loss or theft of its assets withholding and other taxes the fund may be subject to taxes including withholding taxes on income possibly including in some cases capital gains that are or may be imposed by certain countries with respect to the funds investments in such countries these taxes may reduce the return achieved by the fund treaties between the us and such countries may not be available to reduce the otherwise applicable tax rates passive foreign investment companies under us tax laws passive foreign investment companies pfics are those foreign corporations which generate primarily passive income passive income is defined as any income that is considered foreign personal holding company income under the code for federal tax purposes a foreign corporation is deemed to be a pfic if  or more of its gross income during a fiscal year is passive income or if  or more of its assets are assets that produce or are held to produce passive income subject to the limitations under the  act the fund may invest in foreign mutual funds to gain exposure to the securities of companies in countries that limit or prohibit all direct foreign investment foreign mutual funds    are generally deemed to be pfics since nearly all of the income of a mutual fund is passive income some of the other foreign corporations that the fund may invest in such as issuers of eventlinked bonds and other interests may also be considered pfics federal tax laws impose severe tax penalties for failure to properly report investment income from pfics the fund make every effort to ensure compliance with federal tax reporting of these investments however the fund may not realize that a foreign corporation it invests in is a pfic for federal tax purposes in the past us government policies have discouraged certain investments abroad by us investors through taxation or other restrictions and it is possible that such restrictions could be reimposed because the fund can purchase securities denominated in foreign currencies a change in the value of a foreign currency against the us dollar could result in a change in the amount of income the fund has available for distribution because a portion of the funds investment income may be received in foreign currencies the fund will be required to compute its income in us dollars for distribution to shareholders and therefore the fund will absorb the cost of currency fluctuations after the fund has distributed income subsequent foreign currency losses may result in the funds having distributed more income in a particular fiscal period than was available from investment income which could result in a return of capital to shareholders liquidity and restricted securities liquidity risk is the risk that the ils held by the fund may be difficult or impossible to sell at the time that the fund would like or at the price that the fund believes the security is currently worth there can be no assurances that a liquid market will be maintained in which case the funds ability to realize full value in the event of the need to liquidate such assets may be impaired andor result in losses to the fund ils in which the fund invests may be rule a securities which are securities that generally can be purchased and sold only by institutions with at least  million of securities called qualified institutional buyers or qibs rule a securities are considered restricted securities restricted securities may have an active trading market but carry the risk that the active trading market may not continue to the extent that qualified institutional buyers become for a time uninterested in purchasing ils the securities will become illiquid while held by the fund illiquid securities may be difficult to value the fund may be required to hold illiquid securities when it otherwise would sell such securities or may be forced to sell securities at a price lower than the price the fund has valued such securities this may result in losses to the fund and investors nondiversification risk the fund is classified as a nondiversified fund under the  act accordingly the fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer than if it were a diversified fund to the extent that the fund invests a higher percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer the fund is more likely to become subject to the risks associated with and developments affecting that issuer than a fund that invests more widely securities lending the fund may seek to earn income by lending portfolio securities to brokerdealers or other institutional borrowers the fund does not anticipate lending eventlinked bonds but may lend other portfolio securities loans will only be made to firms that have been approved by the adviser and the adviser or the securities lending agent will periodically monitor the financial condition of such organizations while any loans are outstanding the fund may lend up to onethird of the value of its total assets including borrowings or such other amount as is permitted under relevant law the fund will not lend portfolio securities if as a result the aggregate of such loans exceeds   of the value of the funds total assets including such loans loan arrangements made by the fund will comply with all other applicable regulatory requirements for securities lending including with respect to changes in market values termination interest paid on loaned securities and ability to call back loaned securities for voting as with other extensions of credit there are risks of delay in recovery or even loss of rights in the securities loaned if the borrower of the securities fails financially loans will only be made to firms that have been    approved by the investment adviser and the investment adviser or the securities lending agent will periodically monitor the financial condition of such organizations while any loans are outstanding in addition loans will only be made when the investment adviser believes the expected returns net of expenses justify the attendant risk securities loans currently are required to be secured continuously by collateral in cash cash equivalents such as money market instruments or other liquid securities held by the custodian and maintained in an amount at least equal to the market value of the securities loaned repurchase agreements the fund can acquire securities subject to repurchase agreements they might do so for liquidity purposes to meet anticipated redemptions of shares pending the investment of the proceeds from sales of shares pending the settlement of portfolio securities transactions or for temporary defensive purposes as described below in a repurchase transaction the fund buys a security from and simultaneously resells it to an approved vendor for delivery on an agreedupon future date the resale price exceeds the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreedupon interest rate effective for the period during which the repurchase agreement is in effect approved vendors include us commercial banks us branches of foreign banks or brokerdealers that have been designated as primary dealers in government securities they must meet credit requirements set by the adviser from time to time the majority of these transactions run from day to day and delivery pursuant to the resale typically occurs within one to five days of the purchase repurchase agreements having a maturity beyond seven days may be deemed to be illiquid investments there is no limit on the amount of the funds net assets that may be subject to repurchase agreements having maturities of seven days or less repurchase agreements considered loans under the  act are collateralized by the underlying security the funds repurchase agreements require that at all times while the repurchase agreement is in effect the value of the collateral must equal or exceed the repurchase price to fully collateralize the repayment obligation however if the vendor fails to pay the resale price on the delivery date the fund may incur costs in disposing of the collateral and may experience losses if there is any delay in its ability to do so the adviser will monitor the vendors creditworthiness requirements to confirm that the vendor is financially sound and will continuously monitor the collaterals value the fund may transfer uninvested cash balances into one or more joint repurchase accounts these balances are invested in one or more repurchase agreements securities that are pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements are held by a custodian bank until the agreements mature each joint repurchase arrangement requires that the market value of the collateral be sufficient to cover payments of interest and principal however in the event of default by the other party to the agreement retention or sale of the collateral may be subject to legal proceedings reverse repurchase agreements the fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements pursuant to which the fund transfers securities to a counterparty in return for cash and the fund agrees to repurchase the securities at a later date and for a higher price reverse repurchase agreements are treated as borrowings by the fund are a form of leverage and may make the value of an investment in the fund more volatile and increase the risks of investing in the fund the fund also may borrow money from banks or other lenders for temporary purposes in an amount not to exceed  of the funds assets such temporary borrowings are not subject to the asset coverage requirements discussed below in connection with the funds borrowings for investment purposes entering into reverse repurchase agreements and other borrowing transactions may cause the fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so in order to satisfy its obligations or meet segregation requirements borrowing money involves transaction and interest costs the fund may pay a commitment fee or other fees to maintain a line of credit and will pay interest on amounts it borrows to the extent required by sec guidelines if a transaction such as a reverse repurchase agreement exposes the fund to an obligation to another party it will either  enter an offsetting covered position for the same type    of financial asset or  segregate cash or liquid securities on the books of the custodian with a value sufficient at all times to cover its potential obligations not covered assets used as cover or segregated cannot be sold while the positions requiring cover is open unless replaced with other appropriate assets whenissued and delayeddelivery transactions the fund may invest in securities on a whenissued basis and may purchase or sell securities on a delayeddelivery or forwardcommitment basis whenissued and delayeddelivery are terms that refer to securities whose terms and indenture are available and for which a market exists but which are not available for immediate delivery when such transactions are negotiated the price which is generally expressed in yield terms is fixed at the time the commitment is made delivery and payment for the securities take place at a later date the securities are subject to change in value from market fluctuations during the period until settlement the value at delivery may be less than the purchase price for example changes in interest rates in a direction other than that expected by the adviser before settlement will affect the value of such securities and may cause a loss to the fund during the period between purchase and settlement the fund makes no payment to the issuer and no interest accrues to the fund from the investment until it receives the security at settlement the fund may engage in whenissued transactions to secure what the adviser considers to be an advantageous price and yield at the time the obligation is entered into when the fund enters into a whenissued or delayeddelivery transaction it relies on the other party to complete the transaction its failure to do so may cause the fund to lose the opportunity to obtain the security at a price and yield the adviser considers to be advantageous when the fund engages in whenissued and delayeddelivery transactions it does so for the purpose of acquiring or selling securities consistent with its investment objective and policies or for delivery pursuant to options contracts it has entered into and not for the purpose of investment leverage although the funds purpose in entering into delayeddelivery or whenissued purchase transactions is to acquire securities it may dispose of a commitment prior to settlement if the fund chooses to dispose of the right to acquire a whenissued security prior to its acquisition or to dispose of its right to delivery or receive against a forward commitment it may incur a gain or loss at the time the fund makes the commitment to purchase or sell a security on a whenissued or delayeddelivery basis it records the transaction on its books and reflects the value of the security purchased in determining the funds net asset value in a sale transaction it records the proceeds to be received the fund will identify on its books liquid assets at least equal in value to the value of the funds purchase commitments until the fund pays for the investment whenissued and delayeddelivery transactions can be used by the fund as a defensive technique to hedge against anticipated changes in interest rates and prices for instance in periods of rising interest rates and falling prices the fund might sell securities in its portfolio on a forward commitment basis to attempt to limit its exposure to anticipated falling prices in periods of falling interest rates and rising prices the fund might sell portfolio securities and purchase the same or similar securities on a whenissued or delayeddelivery basis to obtain the benefit of currently higher cash yields bank loans the fund may invest in bank loans by purchasing a loan the fund acquires some or all of the interest of a bank or other lending institution in a loan to a particular borrower the fund may act as part of a lending syndicate and in such cases would be purchasing a participation in the loan the fund also may purchase loans by assignment from another lender many loans are secured by the assets of the borrower and most impose restrictive covenants that must be met by the borrower these loans are typically made by a syndicate of banks represented by an agent bank which has negotiated and structured the loan and which is responsible generally for collecting interest principal and other amounts from the borrower on its own behalf and on behalf of the other lending institutions in the syndicate and for enforcing its and their other rights against the borrower each of the lending institutions including the agent bank lends to the borrower a portion of the total amount of the loan and retains the corresponding interest in the loan    the funds ability to receive payments of principal and interest and other amounts in connection with loan participations held by it will depend primarily on the financial condition of the borrower and in some cases the lending institution from which it purchases the loan the value of collateral if any securing a loan can decline or may be insufficient to meet the borrowers obligations or difficult to liquidate in addition the funds access to collateral may be limited by bankruptcy or other insolvency laws the failure by the fund to receive scheduled interest or principal payments on a loan would adversely affect the income of the fund and would likely reduce the value of its assets which would be reflected in a reduction in the funds nav banks and other lending institutions generally perform a credit analysis of the borrower before originating a loan or participating in a lending syndicate in selecting the loans in which the fund will invest however the adviser will not rely solely on that credit analysis but will perform its own investment analysis of the borrowers the advisers analysis may include consideration of the borrowers financial strength and managerial experience debt coverage additional borrowing requirements or debt maturity schedules changing financial conditions and responsiveness to changes in business conditions and interest rates the adviser generally will not have access to nonpublic information to which other investors in syndicated loans may have access because loans in which the fund may invest generally are not rated by independent credit rating agencies a decision by the fund to invest in a particular loan will depend almost exclusively on the advisers and the original lending institutions credit analysis of the borrower investments in loans may be of any quality including distressed loans and will be subject to the funds credit quality policy the loans in which the fund may invest include those that pay fixed rates of interest and those that pay floating rates  ie rates that adjust periodically based on a known lending rate such as a banks prime rate investing directly in loans or other direct debt instruments exposes the fund to various risks similar to those borne by a creditor such risks include the risk of default the risk of delayed repayment and the risk of inadequate collateral investments in loans are also less liquid than investment in publicly traded securities and carry less legal protections in the event of fraud or misrepresentation unlike debt instruments that are securities investments in loans are not regulated by federal securities laws or the sec in addition loan participations involve a risk of insolvency by the lending bank or other financial intermediary financial institutions and government regulation the collapse of various large financial institutions and investment funds across the globe and widespread related losses have resulted in an ongoing severe liquidity crisis throughout the global credit markets during the last several years sectors of the credit markets continue to experience difficulty including the collateralized mortgagebacked securities and leveraged finance markets along with various other areas of consumer finance the lack of transparency and reliable pricing of assets has resulted in some investors withdrawing from the markets for assetbacked securities and related securities the resulting lack of liquidity has become sufficiently widespread to cause credit issues in areas of the capital markets that have limited exposure to subprime mortgages and has prompted central banks in the united states the european union the united kingdom and elsewhere to take action to attempt to ease these liquidity issues and has also resulted in the united states experiencing a broad and ongoing economic recession delinquencies and losses with respect to certain of these asset types such as auto loans have increased and may continue to increase high unemployment and the continued lack of availability of credit may lead to increased default rates on the collateral underlying many of these securities as a result this may adversely affect the performance and market value of the fund if a perception develops that there is or in the future could be renewed regulatory focus on participants who benefit from their participation in any us governmentsponsored program or attempts by legislative andor regulatory bodies to impose new restrictions andor taxes and penalties on such participants possibly even with retroactive effect then the funds position in such securities may be compromised the doddfrank act which was signed into law in july  has resulted in significant revisions of the us financial regulatory framework the doddfrank act covers a broad range of topics including among many others a reorganization of federal financial regulators a process designed to ensure financial systematic stability and the resolution of potentially insolvent financial firms new rules for derivatives trading the creation of a    consumer financial protection watchdog the registration and regulation of private funds the regulation of credit rating agencies and new federal requirements for residential mortgage loans the ultimate impact of the doddfrank act and any resulting regulation is not yet certain and issuers in which the fund invests may also be affected by the new legislation and regulation in ways that are currently unforeseeable governments or their agencies also may acquire distressed assets from financial institutions and acquire ownership interests in those institutions the longterm implications of government ownership and disposition of these assets are unclear and may have positive or negative effects on the liquidity valuation and performance of the funds portfolio holdings investment in relatively new issuers the fund intends to invest occasionally in the common stock of selected new issuers investments in relatively new issuers ie those having continuous operating histories of less than three years may carry special risks and may be more speculative because such companies are relatively unseasoned such companies also may lack sufficient resources may be unable to generate internally the funds necessary for growth and may find external financing to be unavailable on favorable terms or even totally unavailable those companies will often be involved in the development or marketing of a new product with no established market which could lead to significant losses the securities of such issuers may have a limited trading market which may adversely affect their disposition and can result in their being priced lower than might otherwise be the case if other investors who invest in such issuers trade the same securities when the fund attempts to dispose of its holdings the fund may receive lower prices than might otherwise be the case adjustable rate and auction preferred stocks typically the dividend rate on an adjustable rate preferred stock is determined prospectively each quarter by applying an adjustment formula established at the time of issuance of the stock although adjustment formulas vary among issues they typically involve a fixed premium or discount relative to rates on specified debt securities issued by the us treasury typically an adjustment formula will provide for a fixed premium or discount adjustment relative to the highest base yield of three specified us treasury securities the day treasury bill the year treasury note and the year treasury bond the premium or discount adjustment to be added to or subtracted from this highest us treasury base rate yield is fixed at the time of issue and cannot be changed without the approval of the holders of the stock the dividend rate on other preferred stocks commonly known as auction preferred stocks is adjusted at intervals that may be more frequent than quarterly such as every  days based on bids submitted by holders and prospective purchasers of such stocks and may be subject to stated maximum and minimum dividend rates the issues of most adjustable rate and auction preferred stocks currently outstanding are perpetual but are redeemable after a specified date at the option of the issuer certain issues supported by the credit of a highrated financial institution provide for mandatory redemption prior to expiration of the credit arrangement no redemption can occur if full cumulative dividends are not paid although the dividend rates on adjustable and auction preferred stocks generally are adjusted or reset frequently the market values of these preferred stocks still may fluctuate in response to changes in interest rates market values of adjustable preferred stocks also may substantially fluctuate if interest rates increase or decrease once the maximum or minimum dividend rate for a particular stock is approached temporary defensive positions normally the fund invests substantially all of its assets in effort to further its investment objective the fund may invest the remainder of its assets in securities with remaining maturities of less than one year or cash equivalents or may hold cash for temporary defensive purposes including during periods of unusual cash flows the fund may depart from its principal investment strategies and invest part or all of its assets in these securities or may hold cash the fund may adopt defensive strategies when the adviser believes securities in which the fund normally invest have special or unusual risks or are less attractive due to adverse market economic political or other conditions portfolio turnover purchases and sales of portfolio investments may be made as considered advisable by the adviser in the best interests of the shareholders the funds portfolio turnover rate may vary from yeartoyear as well as within a year the funds distributions of any net shortterm capital gains realized from portfolio transactions are taxable to shareholders as ordinary income in addition higher portfolio turnover rates can result in corresponding increases in portfolio transaction costs for the fund    for reporting purposes the funds portfolio turnover rate is calculated by dividing the lesser of purchases or sales of portfolio securities for the fiscal year by the monthly average of the value of the portfolio securities owned by the fund during the fiscal year in determining such portfolio turnover all securities whose maturities at the time of acquisition were one year or less are excluded a  portfolio turnover rate would occur for example if all of the securities in the funds investment portfolio other than shortterm money market securities were replaced once during the fiscal year portfolio turnover will not be a limiting factor should the adviser deem it advisable to purchase or sell securities natural disasters certain areas of the world including the united states are exposed to natural disasters such as drought earthquake flood ice and snow storm meteor strike tornado tropical and extratropical cyclone tsunami volcanic activity or wildfire such disasters and their resulting damage could have a significant adverse impact on the economies of those areas and on the ability of issuers in which the fund invests to conduct their businesses and thus on the investments made by the fund in such geographic areas andor issuers adverse geological hydrological or meteorological conditions could have a significant adverse impact on the ils or other securities that the fund may invest in as well as on the ability of the fund and the adviser to conduct normal daily business operations cyberattack with the increased use of technology such as computers and the internet to conduct business the fund is susceptible to investment operational information security and related risks in general cyberattacks can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events cyberattacks include but are not limited to gaining unauthorized access to digital systems eg through hacking or malicious software coding for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information corrupting data or causing operational disruption cyberattacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access such as causing denialofservice attacks on websites ie efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users cyber security failures or breaches by the funds adviser transfer agent distributor and other service providers including but not limited to the funds custodian and financial intermediaries and the issuers of securities in which the fund invests have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations potentially resulting in financial losses interference with the funds ability to calculate its nav impediments to trading the inability of fund shareholders to transact business violations of applicable privacy and other laws regulatory fines penalties reputational damage reimbursement or other compensation costs or additional compliance costs certain ils andor other securities in which the fund invests may be directly or indirectly exposed to the risk of principal loss resulting from a cyberattack in addition substantial costs may be incurred in order to prevent future cyber incidents while the fund andor the adviser may establish business continuity plans to be implemented in the event of and risk management systems to mitigate the risk of such cyberattacks there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified furthermore the fund cannot control the cyber security plans and systems put in place by service providers to the fund and issuers in which the fund invests the fund and its shareholders could be negatively impacted as a result of any or all of these risk factors equity securities the fund may at times invest in equity securities including american depositary receipts adrs european depositary receipts edrs global depositary receipts gdrs and other similar instruments the stocks in which the fund invests may be more volatile than the stock market as a whole the value of equity investments and related instruments may decline in response to conditions affecting the general economy overall market changes local regional or global political social or economic instability and currency interest rate and commodity price fluctuations as well as issuer or sector specific events market conditions may affect certain types of stocks to a greater extent than other types of stocks if the stock market declines the value of shares will also likely decline and although stock values can rebound there is no assurance that values will return to previous levels preferred stocks may also be sensitive to changes in interest rates when interest rates rise the value of preferred stocks will generally fall convertible securities while some convertible securities are a form of debt security in certain cases their conversion feature allowing conversion into equity securities causes them to be regarded more as equity    equivalents as a result the rating assigned to the security has less impact on the advisers investment decision with respect to convertible securities than in the case of nonconvertible fixed income securities convertible securities are subject to the credit risks and interest rate risks of debt securities described above the value of a convertible security is a function of its investment value and its conversion value if the investment value exceeds the conversion value the security will behave more like a debt security and the securitys price will likely increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise if the conversion value exceeds the investment value the security will behave more like an equity security in that case it will likely sell at a premium over its conversion value and its price will tend to fluctuate directly with the price of the underlying security rights and warrants the fund can hold warrants or rights warrants basically are options to purchase equity securities at specific prices valid for a specific period of time their prices do not necessarily move parallel to the prices of the underlying securities rights are similar to warrants but normally have a short duration and are distributed directly by the issuer to its shareholders rights and warrants have no voting rights receive no dividends and have no rights with respect to the assets of the issuer risks of investing in stocks stocks fluctuate in price and their shortterm volatility at times may be great to the extent that the fund invests in equity securities the value of the funds portfolio will be affected by changes in the stock markets market risk can affect the funds net asset value per share which will fluctuate as the values of the funds portfolio securities change the prices of individual stocks do not all move in the same direction uniformly or at the same time different stock markets may behave differently from each other other factors can affect a particular stocks price such as poor earnings reports by the issuer loss of major customers major litigation against the issuer or changes in government regulations affecting the issuer or its industry the fund can invest in securities of large companies and midsize companies but may also hold stocks of small companies which may have more volatile stock prices than stocks of larger companies investment restrictions the investment objective of the fund is total return the following are the funds fundamental investment restrictions which cannot be changed

              potential conflicts of interest the adviser and the fund have adopted compliance policies and procedures that are designed to avoid mitigate monitor and oversee areas that could present potential conflicts of interest the adviser attempts to address these potential conflicts of interest through various compliance policies that are generally intended to place all accounts regardless of fee structure on the same footing for investment management purposes the adviser has adopted trade allocation procedures that are designed to facilitate the fair allocation of limited investment opportunities among multiple funds the advisers trade allocation policies generally provide that each days transactions in securities that are purchased or sold by multiple accounts are averaged as to price and allocated between the funds in a manner that is equitable to each fund and in accordance with the amount being purchased or sold by each fund trade allocations are reviewed on a periodic basis as part of the advisers trade oversight procedures in an attempt to ensure fairness over time across funds and to monitor whether any fund is systematically favored over time there is no guarantee however that the policies and procedures adopted by the adviser and the fund will be able to detect andor prevent every situation in which an actual or potential conflict may appear these potential conflicts include allocation of limited time and attention a portfolio manager who is responsible for managing multiple funds may devote unequal time and attention to the management of those funds as a result the portfolio manager may not be able to formulate as complete a strategy or identify equally attractive investment opportunities for each of the funds as might be the case if he were to devote substantially more attention to the management of a single fund the effects of this potential conflict may be more pronounced where funds overseen by a particular portfolio manager have different investment strategies allocation of limited investment opportunities if a portfolio manager identifies a limited investment opportunity that may be suitable for multiple funds the opportunity may be allocated among these several funds which may limit the funds ability to take full advantage of the investment opportunity pursuit of differing strategies at times a portfolio manager may determine that an investment opportunity may be appropriate for only some of the fund for which he exercises investment responsibility or may decide that certain of the funds should take differing positions with respect to a particular security in these cases the portfolio manager may place separate transactions for one or more funds which may affect the market price of the security or the execution of the transaction or both to the detriment or benefit of one or more other funds selection of brokersdealers portfolio managers may be able to select or influence the selection of the brokers and dealers that are used to execute securities transactions for the funds that they supervise in addition to executing trades some brokers and dealers provide portfolio managers with brokerage and research services as those terms are defined in section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act which may result in the payment of higher brokerage fees than might have otherwise been available these services may be more beneficial to certain funds than to others related business opportunities the adviser or its affiliates may provide more services such as distribution or recordkeeping for some types of funds than for others in such cases a portfolio manager may benefit either    directly or indirectly by devoting disproportionate attention to the management of funds that provide greater overall returns to the adviser and its affiliates variation in compensation a conflict of interest may arise where the financial or other benefits available to a portfolio manager differ among the fund that he manages if the structure of the advisers management fee andor a portfolio managers compensation differs among funds such as where certain funds pay higher management fees a portfolio manager might be motivated to help certain funds over others a portfolio manager might be motivated to favor funds in which he has an interest or in which the adviser andor its affiliates have interests similarly the desire to maintain or raise assets under management or to enhance a portfolio managers performance record or to derive other rewards financial or otherwise could influence a portfolio manager to lend preferential treatment to those funds that could most significantly benefit a portfolio manager portfolio manager compensation the portfolio manager receives a base salary and may also receive a bonus compensation of the portfolio manager is determined at the discretion of the adviser it may be based on a number of factors including the portfolio managers experience responsibilities the perception of the quality of his work efforts and the consistency with which he demonstrates kindness to other employees trading counterparties vendors and clients the compensation of the portfolio manager is not based upon the performance of client accounts that the portfolio manager manages the adviser reviews the

outstanding shares at nav subject to approval of the board and in all cases such repurchases will be for at least  and not more than  of its outstanding shares at nav in connection with any given repurchase offer it is possible that the fund may offer to repurchase only the minimum amount of  of its outstanding shares it is also possible that a repurchase offer may be oversubscribed with the result that shareholders may only be able to have a portion of their shares repurchased the fund intends to offer the shares in a continuous offering of its shares at net asset value plus the applicable sales charge there can be no assurance that the fund will offer its shares on a continuous basis or if so offered that it will do so indefinitely    net asset value as described in the funds prospectus the nav of the fund is determined by dividing the total value of the funds portfolio investments and other assets less any liabilities including accrued expenses or dividends by the total number of shares outstanding the shares are valued as of a particular time the valuation time on the last day of each week and last day of each month if different that the new york stock exchange nyse is open for business as of the close of the regular trading session of the nyse the fund reserves the right to calculate the net asset value more frequently if deemed desirable the valuation time is ordinarily at the close of regular trading on the nyse normally  pm eastern time the fund expects that the holidays upon which the nyse will be closed are as follows new years day martin luther king jr day presidents day good friday memorial day independence day labor day thanksgiving day and christmas day the total of fund liabilities plus any distribution andor servicing fees and any other expenses are then deducted from the funds assets and the resulting amount is divided by the number of shares outstanding to produce the funds nav in accordance with regulations governing registered investment companies the funds transactions in portfolio securities and purchases and sales of shares which bear upon the number of shares outstanding are generally not reflected in the nav determined for the business day on which the transactions are effected the trade date but rather on the following business day the board has delegated primary responsibility for determining or causing to be determined the value of the funds portfolio securities and other assets including any fair value pricing and the funds navs to the administrator pursuant to rule a under the  act and valuation policies and procedures approved by the board the valuation procedures the board has established a valuation committee to which they have delegated responsibility to officers of the adviser for overseeing the implementation of the valuation procedures and fair value determinations made on behalf of the board as described in the funds prospectus the board has approved procedures pursuant to which the fund will value its investments in accordance with these procedures the administrator values the funds investments for which market quotations are readily available at market value the valuation procedures include a detailed pricing matrix of pricing methodologies to be used by the administrator as approved by the board listed below is a summary of certain of the methods generally used to value investments some or all of which may be held by the fund under the valuation procedures shortterm debt instruments such as commercial paper bankers acceptances and us treasury bills having a maturity of less than  days are valued at amortized cost other debt securities including corporate and government debt securities of us or foreign issuers and municipal debt securities in each case having a remaining maturity in excess of  days event linked bonds loans mortgagebacked securities collateralized mortgage obligations loans and other assetbacked securities are valued by using the mean between the closing bid and asked prices provided by a pricing agent or independent brokers or a market maker if the closing bid and asked prices are not readily available the pricing service may provide a price determined by a matrix pricing method equity securities are valued at the last sale official close or if there are no reported sales at the mean between the bid and asked price on the primary exchange on which they are traded subject to certain variations for securities listed on foreign principal markets exchangetraded options are valued at the mean of the bid and asked prices overthecounter options are valued based on quotations obtained from a pricing service or from a broker typically the counterparty to the option overthecounter traded securities that are not traded on a listed exchange are valued at the last sale on the otc exchange as quoted by nasdaq mean price in the overthecounter market if a nonexchange traded security does not trade on a particular day then the mean between the closing bid and asked prices will be used    nonexchange traded derivatives are generally valued on the basis of valuations provided by a pricing service or using quotes provided by a brokerdealer typically the counterparty restricted securities are generally deemed to be securities not registered under the  act restricted securities are ordinarily valued at the value provided by the appropriate pricing source which takes into account the restricted nature of the security if market values are not readily available including in cases where available market quotations are deemed to be unreliable or infrequent the funds investments will be valued as determined in good faith pursuant to the valuation procedures socalled fair value pricing in these circumstances the fund determines fair value in a manner that fairly reflects the market value of the security on the valuation date based on consideration of any information or factors it deems appropriate fair value pricing may require subjective determinations about the value of a security or other asset and fair values used to determine the funds nav may differ from quoted or published prices or from prices that are used by others for the same investments also the use of fair value pricing may not always result in adjustments to the prices of securities or other assets held by the fund and it is possible that the fair value determined for a security may be materially different than the value that could be realized upon the sale of such security shortterm debt securities which have a maturity date of  days or less are valued at amortized cost which approximates fair value the funds prospectus provides additional information regarding the circumstances in which fair value pricing may be used and related information portfolio transactions and brokerage investment decisions and portfolio transactions investment decisions for the fund are made with a view to achieving its investment objective investment decisions are the product of many factors in addition to basic suitability for the particular client involved including the fund some securities considered for investment by the fund also may be appropriate for other clients served by the adviser thus a particular security may be bought or sold for certain clients even though it could have been bought or sold for other clients at the same time if a purchase or sale of securities consistent with the investment policies of the fund and one or more of these clients is considered at or about the same time transactions in such securities will be allocated among the fund and clients in a manner deemed fair and reasonable by the adviser the adviser will generally execute transactions for the fund on an aggregated basis when the adviser believes that to do so will allow it to obtain best execution and to negotiate more favorable commission rates or other transaction costs that might have otherwise been paid had such orders been placed independently aggregation or bunching describes a procedure whereby an investment adviser combines the orders of two or more clients into a single order for the purpose of obtaining better prices and lower execution costs brokerage and research services there is generally no stated commission in the case of securities traded on a principal basis in the overthecounter markets but the price paid by the fund usually includes an undisclosed dealer commission or markup in underwritten offerings the price paid by the fund includes a disclosed fixed commission or discount retained by the underwriter or dealer transactions on us stock exchanges and other agency transactions involve the payment by the fund of negotiated brokerage commissions such commissions vary among different brokers also a particular broker may charge different commissions according to such factors as the difficulty and size of the transaction transactions in nonus securities generally involve the payment of fixed brokerage commissions which are generally higher than those in the united states the purchase by the fund of participations or assignments may be pursuant to privately negotiated transactions pursuant to which the fund may be required to pay fees to the seller or forego a portion of payments in respect of the participation agreement    the adviser places orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities options and futures contracts and buys and sells such securities options and futures for the fund through a substantial number of brokers and dealers in so doing the adviser uses its best efforts to obtain for the fund the most favorable price and execution available except to the extent it may be permitted to pay higher brokerage commissions as described below in seeking the most favorable price and execution the adviser having in mind the funds best interests considers all factors it deems relevant including price the size of the transaction the nature of the market for the security the amount of the commission the timing of the transaction taking into account market prices and trends the reputation experience and financial stability of the brokerdealer involved and the quality of service rendered by the brokerdealer in that or other transactions the adviser places orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities options and futures contracts and buys and sells such securities options and futures for the fund through multiple brokers and dealers the adviser will place trades for execution only with approved brokers or dealers in effecting purchases and sales of portfolio securities for the accounts of the fund the adviser will seek the best price and execution of the funds orders in doing so the fund may pay higher commission rates than the lowest available when the adviser believes it is reasonable to do so in light of the value of the brokerage and research services provided by the broker effecting the transaction as discussed below although the fund may use a brokerdealer that sells shares to effect transactions for the funds portfolios the fund will not consider the sale of shares as a factor when selecting brokerdealers to execute those transactions it has for many years been a common practice in the investment advisory business for advisers of investment companies and other institutional investors to receive research and brokerage products and services together services from brokerdealers which execute portfolio transactions for the clients of such advisers consistent with this practice the adviser receives services from many brokerdealers with which the adviser places the funds portfolio transactions these services which in some cases also may be purchased for cash may include among other things such items as general economic and security market reviews industry and company reviews evaluations of securities recommendations as to the purchase and sale of securities and services related to the execution of securities transactions the advisory fees paid by the fund are not reduced because the adviser receives such services even though the receipt of such services relieves the adviser from expenses they might otherwise bear research and brokerage services provided by brokerdealers chosen by the adviser to place the funds portfolio transactions may be useful to the adviser in providing services to the advisers other clients although not all of these services may be necessarily useful and of value to the adviser in managing the fund conversely research and brokerage services provided to the adviser by brokerdealers in connection with trades executed on behalf of other clients of the adviser may be useful to the adviser in managing the fund although not all of these services may be necessarily useful and of value to the adviser in managing such other clients in reliance on the safe harbor provided by section e of the exchange act the adviser may cause the fund to pay a brokerdealer which provides brokerage and research services as defined for purposes of section e to the adviser an amount of commission for effecting a securities transaction for the fund in excess of the commission which another brokerdealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the adviser makes a good faith determination that the commissions are reasonable in relation to the value of brokerage and research services provided viewed in terms of either a particular transaction or the advisers overall responsibilities to all discretionary accounts the adviser may place orders for the purchase and sale of exchangelisted portfolio securities with a brokerdealer that is an affiliate of the adviser where in the judgment of the adviser such firm will be able to obtain a price and execution at least as favorable as other qualified brokerdealers pursuant to rules of the sec a brokerdealer that is an affiliate of the adviser may receive and retain compensation for effecting portfolio transactions for the fund on a securities exchange if the commissions paid to such an affiliated brokerdealer by the fund on exchange transactions do not exceed usual and customary brokerage commissions the rules define usual and customary commissions to include amounts which are reasonable and fair compared to the commission fee or other remuneration received or to be received by other brokers in connection with comparable transactions involving similar securities being purchased or sold on a securities exchange during a comparable period of time    regular broker dealers the fund is required to identify the securities of its regular brokers or dealers as defined in rule b under the  act or their parent companies held by the fund as of the close of their most recent fiscal year and state the value of such holdings as of the date of this sai the fund did not hold any securities of its regular brokers or dealers or their parent companies tax status taxation of the fund in general the following discussion of the us federal income tax consequences of investment in the fund is based on the code us treasury regulations and other applicable authority as of the date of the preparation of this sai these authorities are subject to change by legislative or administrative action possibly with retroactive effect the following discussion is only a summary of some of the important us federal tax considerations generally applicable to investments in the fund there may be other tax considerations applicable to particular shareholders such as the  medicare tax on certain investment income us federal estate and gift tax laws and us state taxation among others shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their particular situation and the possible application of foreign state and local tax laws the fund intends to elect to be treated and to qualify each year as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of chapter  of the code in order to qualify for the special tax treatment accorded regulated investment companies and their shareholders the fund must among other things a derive at least  of its gross income for each taxable year from i dividends interest payments with respect to certain securities loans and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock securities or foreign currencies or other income including but not limited to gains from options futures or forward contracts derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock securities or currencies and ii net income derived from interests in qualified publicly traded partnerships as defined below b diversify its holdings so that at the end of the quarter of the funds taxable year i at least  of the market value of the funds total assets consists of cash and cash items us government securities securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities limited in respect of any one issuer to a value not greater than  of the value of the funds total assets and not more than  of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and ii not more than  of the value of the funds total assets is invested x in the securities other than those of the us government or other regulated investment companies of any one issuer or of two or more issuers that the fund controls and that are engaged in the same similar or related trades or businesses or y in the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships as defined below and c distribute with respect to each taxable year at least  of the sum of its investment company taxable income as that term is defined in the code without regard to the deduction for dividends paid  generally taxable ordinary income and the excess if any of net shortterm capital gains over net longterm capital losses and net taxexempt interest income for such year for purposes of the  gross income requirement described in a above income derived from a partnership will be treated as qualifying income only to the extent such income is attributable to items of income of the partnership which would be qualifying income if realized by the regulated investment company however  of the net income derived from an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership will be treated as qualifying income a qualified publicly traded partnership is defined as a partnership i interests in which are traded on an established securities market or readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof ii that derives at least  of its income from the passive income sources defined in code section    d and iii that derives less than  of its income from the qualifying income described in ai above in addition although in general the passive loss rules of the code do not apply to regulated investment companies such rules do apply to a regulated investment company with respect to items attributable to an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership for purposes of the diversification requirements described in b above the term outstanding voting securities of such issuer will include the equity securities of a qualified publicly traded partnership gains from foreign currencies including foreign currency options foreign currency swaps foreign currency futures and foreign currency forward contracts currently constitute qualifying income for purposes of the  good income test described in a above however the treasury department has the authority to issue regulations possibly with retroactive effect excluding from the definition of qualifying income the funds foreign currency gains to the extent that such income is not directly related to the funds principal business of investing in stock or securities the fund may invest in certain assets that do not give rise to good income and do not constitute securities for purposes of the regulated investment company qualification tests referred to above the fund also may invest in other assets such as various derivative and structured investment products the status of which as securities for the above purposes may not be fully settled in general if the fund qualifies as a regulated investment company that is accorded special tax treatment the fund will not be subject to federal income tax on income distributed in a timely manner to its shareholders in the form of dividends including capital gain dividends as defined below by contrast if the fund were to fail to qualify as a regulated investment company in any taxable year the fund would be subject to tax on its taxable income at corporate rates in addition all distributions from earnings and profits including any distributions of net taxexempt income and net longterm capital gains would be taxable to shareholders as dividend income some portions of such distributions may be eligible for the dividends received deduction in the case of corporate shareholders or may be treated as qualified dividend income to individual shareholders finally the fund could be required to recognize unrealized gains pay substantial taxes and interest and make substantial distributions before requalifying as a regulated investment company the fund intends to distribute at least annually to its shareholders all or substantially all of its investment company taxable income computed without regard to the dividendspaid deduction and may distribute its net capital gain investment company taxable income that is retained by the fund will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates if the fund retains any net capital gain it will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates on the amount retained however the fund may designate the retained capital gain amount as undistributed capital gains in a notice to its shareholders who i will be required to include in income for federal income tax purposes as longterm capital gain their share of such undistributed amount and ii will be entitled to credit their proportionate share of the tax paid by the fund on such undistributed amount against their federal income tax liabilities if any and to claim refunds on a properlyfiled us tax return to the extent the credit exceeds such liabilities for federal income tax purposes the tax basis of shares owned by a shareholder of the fund will be increased by an amount equal to the difference between the amount of undistributed capital gains included in the shareholders gross income and the tax deemed paid by the shareholder under clause ii of the preceding sentence in determining its net capital gain for capital gain dividend purposes a regulated investment company generally must treat any net capital loss or any net longterm capital loss incurred after october  as if it had been incurred in the succeeding year in determining its net capital gain including in connection with determining the amount available to support a capital gain dividend its taxable income and its earnings and profits a regulated investment company may also elect to treat any postoctober capital loss defined as the greatest of net capital loss net longterm capital loss or net shortterm capital loss in each case attributable to the portion of the    taxable year after october  and lateyear ordinary loss generally i net ordinary losses from the sale exchange or other taxable disposition of property attributable to the portion of the taxable year after october  plus ii other net ordinary losses attributable to the portion of the taxable year after december  as if incurred in the succeeding taxable year if the fund fails to distribute in a calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of  of its ordinary income for such year and  of its capital gain net income for the oneyear period ending october  of such year plus any retained amount from the prior year the fund will be subject to a nondeductible  excise tax on the underdistributed amounts for these purposes the fund will be treated as having distributed any amount on which it has been subject to corporate income tax in the taxable year ending within the calendar year the fund intends generally to make distributions sufficient to avoid imposition of the  excise tax although there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so a dividend paid to shareholders in january of a year generally is deemed to have been paid by the fund on december  of the preceding year if the dividend was declared and payable to shareholders of record on a date in october november or december of that preceding year fund distributions except in the case of certain shareholders eligible for preferential tax treatment eg qualified retirement or pension trusts shareholders of the fund generally will be subject to federal income tax on fund distributions distributions are taxable whether shareholders receive them in cash or reinvest them in additional shares through a dividend reinvestment plan distributions are taxable to shareholders even if they are paid from income or gains earned by the fund before a shareholders investment and thus were included in the price the shareholder paid for his or her shares such distributions are likely to occur in respect of shares purchased at a time when the funds nav reflects gains that are either unrealized or realized but not distributed such realized gains may be required to be distributed even when the funds nav also reflects unrealized losses distributions by the fund of investment income generally will be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income taxes on distributions of capital gains are determined by how long the fund owned the investments that generated them rather than how long a shareholder has owned his or her shares distributions of net capital gains from the sale of investments that the fund owned for more than one year and that are properly designated by the fund as capital gain dividends capital gain dividends will be taxable as longterm capital gains distributions from capital gains are generally made after applying any available capital loss carryovers the maximum tax rate for individuals with respect to longterm capital gain is  for individuals in the  or  income tax brackets  for individuals in the  through  tax brackets and  for individuals in the  tax bracket distributions of gains from the sale of investments that the fund owned for one year or less will be taxable as ordinary income distributions of investment income designated by the fund as derived from qualified dividend income will be taxed in the hands of individuals at the rates applicable to longterm capital gain provided that both the shareholder and the fund meet certain holding period and other requirements specifically in order for some portion of the dividends received by the fund shareholder to be qualified dividend income the fund must meet certain holding period and other requirements with respect to some portion of the dividendpaying stocks in its portfolio and the shareholder must meet certain holding period and other requirements with respect to the shares a dividend will not be treated as qualified dividend income at either the fund or shareholder level  if the dividend is received with respect to any share of stock held for fewer than  days during the day period beginning on the date which is  days before the date on which such share becomes exdividend with respect to such dividend or in the case of certain preferred stock  days during the day period beginning  days before such date  to the extent that the recipient is under an obligation whether pursuant to a short sale or    otherwise to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property  if the recipient elects to have the dividend income treated as investment income for purposes of the limitation on deductibility of investment interest or  if the dividend is received from a foreign corporation that is a not eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the united states with the exception of dividends paid on stock of such a foreign corporation that is readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states or b treated as a passive foreign investment company in general distributions of investment income designated by the fund as derived from qualified dividend income will be treated as qualified dividend income by a shareholder taxed as an individual provided the shareholder meets the holding period and other requirements described above with respect to the shares if the aggregate qualified dividends received by the fund during any taxable year are  or more of its gross income excluding net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital loss then  of the funds dividends other than dividends properly designated as capital gain dividends will be eligible to be treated as qualified dividend income dividends of net investment income received by corporate shareholders of the fund will qualify for the  dividends received deduction generally available to corporations to the extent of the amount of qualifying dividends received by the fund from domestic corporations for the taxable year a dividend received by the fund will not be treated as a qualifying dividend  if the stock on which the dividend is paid is considered to be debtfinanced generally acquired with borrowed funds  if it has been received with respect to any share of stock that the fund has held for less than  days during the day period beginning on the date which is  days before the date on which such share becomes exdividend with respect to such dividend less than  days during the day period beginning  days before such date in the case of certain preferred stock or  to the extent that the fund is under an obligation pursuant to a short sale or otherwise to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property moreover the dividends received deduction may be disallowed or reduced  if the corporate shareholder fails to satisfy the foregoing requirements with respect to its shares or  otherwise by application of the code a portion of the interest paid or accrued on certain high yield discount obligations owned by the fund may be treated as a dividend for purposes of the corporate dividends received deduction in such cases if the issuer of the high yield discount obligations is a domestic corporation dividend payments by the fund may be eligible for the dividends received deduction to the extent of the deemed dividend portion of such accrued interest if the fund makes a distribution to a shareholder in excess of the funds current and accumulated earnings and profits in any taxable year the excess distribution will be treated as a return of capital to the extent of such shareholders tax basis in its shares and thereafter as capital gain a return of capital is not taxable but it reduces a shareholders tax basis in its shares thus reducing any loss or increasing any gain on a subsequent taxable disposition by the shareholder of its shares an investor should also be aware that the benefits of the reduced tax rate applicable to longterm capital gains and qualified dividend income may be impacted by the application of the alternative minimum tax to individual shareholders repurchases and exchanges the repurchase or exchange of shares may give rise to a gain or loss in general any gain or loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares will be treated as longterm capital gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than  months otherwise the gain or loss on a taxable disposition of fund shares will be treated as shortterm capital gain or loss however any loss realized upon a taxable disposition of shares held for six months or less will be treated as longterm rather than shortterm to the extent of any longterm capital gain distributions received or deemed received by the shareholder with respect to the shares all or a portion of any loss realized upon a taxable disposition of fund shares will be disallowed if other substantially identical shares of the fund    are purchased within  days before or after the disposition in such a case the basis of the newly purchased shares will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss a repurchase by the fund of its shares from a shareholder generally will be treated as a sale of the shares by a shareholder provided that after the repurchase the shareholder does not own either directly or by attribution under section  of the code any shares if after a repurchase a shareholder continues to own directly or by attribution any shares it is possible that any amounts received by such shareholder in the repurchase will be taxable as a dividend to such shareholder and there is a risk that shareholders who do not have any of their shares repurchased would be treated as having received a dividend distribution as a result of their proportionate increase in the ownership of the fund use of the funds cash to repurchase shares could adversely affect the funds ability to satisfy the distribution requirements for qualification as a regulated investment company the fund could also recognize income in connection with the liquidation of portfolio securities to fund share repurchases any such income would be taken into account in determining whether the distribution requirements were satisfied foreign taxes and investments income received by the fund from sources within foreign countries may be subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by such countries tax treaties between certain countries and the us may reduce or eliminate such taxes if more than  of the funds assets at year end consist of the securities of foreign corporations the fund may elect to permit shareholders to claim a credit or deduction on their income tax returns for their pro rata portions of qualified taxes paid by the fund to foreign countries in respect of foreign securities that the fund has held for at least the minimum period specified in the code in such a case shareholders will include in gross income from foreign sources their pro rata share of such taxes a shareholders ability to claim a foreign tax credit or deduction in respect of foreign taxes paid by the fund may be subject to certain limitations imposed by the code which may result in the shareholders not getting a full credit or deduction for the amount of such taxes shareholders who do not itemize on their federal income tax returns may claim a credit but not a deduction for such foreign taxes the fund may invest in one or more passive foreign investment companies pfics a pfic is generally any foreign corporation if for any year in the funds holding period i  percent or more of the income of the corporation is passive income or ii at least  percent of the assets of the corporation generally by value but by adjusted tax basis in certain cases produce or are held for the production of passive income generally passive income for this purpose means dividends interest including income equivalent to interest royalties rents annuities the excess of gain over losses from certain property transactions and commodities transactions and foreign currency gains investments by the fund in a pfic could potentially subject the fund to a us federal income tax including interest charges on distributions received from the pfic or on proceeds received from the disposition of shares in the pfic this tax cannot be eliminated by making distributions to fund shareholders however the fund may make elections to avoid the imposition of such taxes the fund generally intends to elect to treat a pfic as a qualified electing fund ie make a qef election in which case the fund will be required to include its share of the pfics income and net capital gains annually regardless of whether it receives any distribution from the pfic the fund will only be able to make a qef election with respect to a pfic however if that pfic provides information about its income and gain to its investors each year if the fund is not able to make a qef election with respect to pfic the fund will generally elect to mark the gains and to a limited extent losses in the pfic to the market as though it had sold and repurchased its holdings in the pfic on the last day of the funds taxable year such gains and losses are treated as ordinary income and loss the marktomarket and qef elections may accelerate the recognition of income by the fund without the receipt of cash and increase the amount required to be distributed by the fund to avoid taxation in addition if a sufficient portion of the voting interests in a foreign issuer are held by the fund individually or together with other us persons that issuer may be treated as a controlled foreign corporation with respect to the fund in which case the fund will be required to    take into account each year as ordinary income its share of certain portions of that issuers income whether or not such amounts are distributed in any of these situations the fund may need to liquidate other investments including when it is not advantageous to do so to meet its distribution requirement which also may accelerate the recognition of gain and affect the funds total return in addition to the extent that the funds marktomarket loss with respect to a pfic exceeds its prior inclusions the loss will effectively be taken into account in offsetting future marktomarket gains from the pfic and any remaining loss will generally be deferred until the pfic shares are sold at which point the loss will be treated as a capital loss losses on shares of pfics with respect to which no marktomarket election is made will also generally be capital in character such capital losses will generally be deductible only against capital gains recognized by the fund in that year or one in future years but if the fund does not generate sufficient capital gains from its investments capital losses recognized by the fund will generally not result in a reduction of taxable distributions to shareholders dividends paid by pfics will not be eligible to be treated as qualified dividend income if neither a qef nor mark to market election is made with respect to an interest in a pfic and the fund does not make a general mark to market election as a trader in securities the ownership of the pfic interest may have significantly adverse tax consequences for the owner in such a case the fund would be subject to an interest charge at the rate applicable to tax underpayments on tax liability treated as having been deferred with respect to certain distributions and on gain from the disposition of the shares of a pfic collectively referred to as excess distributions even if those excess distributions are paid by the fund as a dividend to shareholders finally the funds transactions in foreign currencies foreign currencydenominated debt obligations and certain foreign currency options futures contracts and forward contracts and similar instruments may give rise to ordinary income or loss to the extent such income or loss results from fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency concerned certain investments in debt obligations if the fund purchases a debt obligation with acquisition discount or original issue discount oid the fund may be required to include the acquisition discount or oid in income over the term of the debt security even though payment of that amount is not received until a later time usually when the debt security matures the fund may make one or more of the elections applicable to debt obligations having acquisition discount or oid which could affect the character and timing of recognition of income by the fund the fund may be required to pay out as an income distribution each year an amount which is greater than the total amount of cash interest the fund actually received such distributions may be made from the cash assets of the fund or by liquidation of portfolio securities if necessary the fund may realize gains or losses from such liquidations in the event the fund realizes net capital gains from such transactions its shareholders may receive a larger distributions than they would in the absence of such transactions paymentinkind securities will also give rise to income which is required to be distributed even though the fund holding the security receives no interest payment in cash on the security during the year in addition investments in certain exchangetraded notes etns may accrue interest which is required to be distributed to shareholders even though the fund may not receive any interest payment in cash on the security during the year investments in debt obligations that are in the lowest rating categories or are unrated including debt obligations of issuers at risk of or in default present special tax issues for the fund tax rules are not entirely clear about issues such as when the fund may cease to accrue interest oid or market discount when and to what extent deductions may be taken for bad debts or worthless securities and how payments received on obligations in default should be allocated between principal and interest these and other related issues will be addressed by the fund when as and if it invests in such securities in order to seek to ensure that it distributes sufficient income to preserve its status as a regulated investment company and does not become subject to us federal income or excise tax    derivative transactions if the fund engages in derivative transactions including transactions in options futures contracts forward contracts swap agreements foreign currencies and straddles other section  contracts or other similar transactions including for hedging purposes it will be subject to special tax rules including marktomarket constructive sale straddle wash sale and short sale rules the effect of which may be to accelerate income to the fund defer losses to the fund cause adjustments in the holding periods of the funds securities convert longterm capital gains into shortterm capital gains and convert shortterm capital losses into longterm capital losses these rules could therefore affect the amount timing and character of distributions to shareholders the funds transactions in foreign currencydenominated debt instruments and certain of its derivative activities may produce a difference between its book income and its taxable income if the funds book income exceeds its taxable income the distribution if any of such excess generally will be treated as i a dividend to the extent of the funds remaining earnings and profits including earnings and profits arising from taxexempt income ii thereafter as a return of capital to the extent of the recipients basis in its shares and iii thereafter as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset if the funds book income is less than the sum of its taxable income and net taxexempt income if any the fund could be required to make distributions exceeding book income to qualify as a regulated investment company and to eliminate fundlevel income tax backup withholding the fund generally is required to withhold and remit to the us treasury a percentage of the

in many cases excepted from this reporting requirement but under current guidance shareholders of a regulated investment company are not excepted future guidance may extend the current exception from

dated                   to be provided    appendix a securities ratings the rating of a rating service represents the services opinion as to the credit quality of the security being rated however the ratings are general and are not absolute standards of quality or guarantees as to the creditworthiness of an issuer consequently the adviser believes that the quality of debt securities in which the fund invests should be continuously reviewed a rating is not a recommendation to purchase sell or hold a security because it does not take into account market value or suitability for a particular investor when a security has received a rating from more than one service each rating should be evaluated independently ratings are based on current information furnished by the issuer or obtained by the ratings services from other sources which they consider reliable ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information or for other reasons the following is a description of the characteristics of ratings used by moodys and standard  poors moodys ratings aaabonds rated aaa are judged to be the best quality they carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as giltedge interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure although the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such bonds aabonds rated aa are judged to be high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa bonds or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the longterm risk appear somewhat larger than in aaa bonds abonds rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future baabonds rated baa are considered as medium grade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well babonds rated ba are judged to have speculative elements their future cannot be considered as well assured often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the future uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class bbonds rated b generally lack characteristics of the desirable investment assurance of interest and principal payments or of maintenance of other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small caabonds rated caa are of poor standing such bonds may be in default or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal or interest cabonds rated ca represent obligations which are speculative in a high degree such bonds are often in default or have other marked shortcomings   a standard  poors ratings aaabonds rated aaa have the highest rating capacity to pay principal and interest is extremely strong aabonds rated aa have a very strong capacity to pay principal and interest and differ from aaa bonds only in small degree abonds rated a have a strong capacity to pay principal and interest although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than bonds in higher rated categories bbbbonds rated bbb are regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay principal and interest whereas they normally exhibit protection parameters adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay principal and interest for bonds in this capacity than for bonds in higher rated categories bbbcccccbonds aarated bb b ccc and cc are regarded on balance as predominantly speculative with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation bb indicates the lowest degree of speculation among such bonds and cc the highest degree of speculation although such bonds will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these are outweighed by large uncertainties or major risk exposures to adverse conditions   a appendix b proxy voting policies and procedures to be provided   b part cother information item  financial

catastrophe bonds insurance linked securities reinsurance capital  investment risk transfer intelligence vloedman to launch redmond reinsurance investment interval fund share     read later copypaste link by artemis on march   a new ils and reinsurance linked interval fund is launching under the watch of exanchor risk advisors and experienced ils exec pete vloedman the redmond reinsurance investment interval fund is being launched with vloedman as its portfolio manager the ownership of this new mutual fund as an interval fund it comes under the ’s act is interesting with the adviser to the fund for whom vloedman will be working named as redmond capital management llc the ownership of redmond capital management is convoluted being a wholly owned subsidiary of redmond capital holdings llc which is in turn a direct subsidiary of geovera investment group ltd geovera interestingly is a provider of specialty residential property hurricane and earthquake insurance products largely in peak exposure zones the ultimate ownership is even more complex “geovera is majority owned by flexpoint fund ii cayman lp an alternative investment vehicle formed as a cayman islands exempted limited partnership under the control of its general partner flexpoint management ii cayman ltd which is under the control of its general partner flexpoint ultimate management ii cayman ltd which is ultimately under the control of edwards capital llc dba flexpoint ford llc “flexpoint” an illinois limited liability company flexpoint is a private equity investment firm based in chicago illinois” says the funds prospectus so ultimately it seems the ownership of redmond capital comes back to private equity money investing in insurance and reinsurance risks which now sees an opportunity to offer mutual fund investors a way to directly access the returns of insurance and reinsurance business as of  pete vloedman now works as a managing director of geovera insurance holdings inc and president of redmond capital previously he has been consulting in the ils and reinsurance space prior to which he was ceo of ils investment manager anchor risk advisors before which he was with magnetar capital and aj sterge vloedman has been in the ils and catastrophe bond space for many years so as portfolio manager for a new interval ils and reinsurance fund is well suited to the role vloedman will be responsible for daytoday portfolio management and investment decisions for the redmond reinsurance investment interval fund the fund will invest “primarily in reinsurancerelated securities commonly known as insurance linked securities “ils” ils may include eventlinked bonds also known as catastrophe or cat bonds structured reinsurance investments including but not limited to quota share instruments also known as “reinsurance sidecars” collateralized reinsurance investments and eventlinked swaps interests in pooled investment vehicles including registered investment companies that invest primarily in reinsurancerelated securities securities of companies in the insurance or reinsurance industries and other insurance and reinsurancerelated securities” so the full range of ils and reinsurancelinked investments will be used to construct the portfolio for the redmond reinsurance investment interval fund meaning both liquid and illiquid ils assets will be considered hence we assume the choice to launch the redmond reinsurance investment interval fund as a ’s act interval fund not only does the ’s act classification open the fund up to different types of investors via sales through registered investment advisers but the interval fund structure allows liquidity in the fund to be controlled to allow less liquid and often higher yielding ils investments to be made an ‘interval’ fund allows the investment manager to target a lessliquid portfolio of assets while still being able to offer investors liquidity opportunities at regular intervals in this way the investment manager can retain some control over redemption volumes while still leveraging lessliquid and typically the higher returning group of ils structures and assets the redmond reinsurance investment interval fund will offer its investors liquidity intervals with quarterly repurchase offerings typically for  of the fund’s shares these repurchase offers will be for at least  and not more than  of the fund’s outstanding shares every quarter the documentation explains also of note is the fact that the redmond reinsurance investment interval fund only has to invest  of its assets in ils and reinsurancelinked assets which will allow it to allocate the rest of the capital to liquid assets such as treasuries or money market funds that can then be liquidated easily to provide the liquidity necessary to redeem shares at the quarterly intervals redmond capital has signed a distribution agreement with alps distributors a wellknown mutual fund distribution services company and all sales will take place via alps this should give the redmond ils fund a platform to get in front of the investors it is seeking capital from the ultimate investors will need to buy into the redmond reinsurance interval fund via their registered investment advisors while a few other types of investors will also be allowed likely institutional this means that the redmond reinsurance investment interval fund will be accessible to retail investor money the minimum investment account size with the fund is to be set at m for registered investment advisors ria’s however within that m could be many endinvestors accessing the ils and reinsurance space with much smaller allocations we’d imagine we understand that shares in the redmond reinsurance investment interval fund will be offered at  each but at this time there is no information on how much capital the fund is targeting however being a mutual fund it will have to report to the sec regularly so we should get a sight of how successful this launch offering for the fund has been mutual funds investing in ils and reinsurancelinked assets have been very successful so far stone ridge asset management is the best example which has its own interval ils fund and has raised over  billion across three mutual ils funds with the interval fund attracting over  billion of capital mutual fund manager pioneer investments also launched an interval fund the pioneer ils interval fund for which it raised an initial m but we understand has grown since how far we’re unsure at this time the interval fund approach is extremely wellsuited to the ils and reinsurance linked asset class as it allows investments to be made in quota shares sidecars private collateralized deals and other less liquid ils assets which increasingly make up the bulk of the marketplace as a result the returns can be more attractive for investors too with these types of transaction offering better return possibilities and allowing the investment managers to target returns of  and upwards depending on the risk appetite of the fund and its investors redmond capital as the investment advisor and pete vloedman as the portfolio manager will no doubt seek to access as diverse a portfolio of transactions as possible once the capital has been raised from this initial offering of shares size will matter as for a new fund manager and ils fund entering the space there will be a requirement to prove the platform and concept before counterparties will welcome them to their deals especially in such a capital rich and competitive marketplace however vloedman’s history in the space and in reinsurance in general is sure to gain the redmond reinsurance investment interval fund access to enough interesting deals to start constructing a diversified portfolio as more ils mutual funds and interval funds targeting the reinsurance space launch the sector will increasingly have retail investor money in it some remain concerned about this prospect feeling that ils is a product for sophisticated institutional investors only whatever your feeling about more retail type investors accessing the ils space it is destined to continue to grow as a pool of capital thanks to mutual fund structures and some european ucits funds the onus will be on the investment manager and also the ria’s to advise clients and investors educate them on the risks and to be transparent in everything they do particularly when it comes to any losses as quickly as the more retail type of investor can enter the space they can easily leave it as well it will be interesting to watch how redmond capital and vloedman progress this new venture as this new mutual fund launches in the ils space how much capital the redmond reinsurance investment interval fund
