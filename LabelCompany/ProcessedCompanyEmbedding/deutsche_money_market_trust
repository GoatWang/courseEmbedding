companies give the few honest ones a very bad name  their main if not only stream of income is in charging huge sums of money to the inventors of whom they are representing the way they work is by offering the inventor a marketability analysis that touts of high returns if only the inventor moves to the next step which costs upwards of  the inventor gets a second mortgage on his or her home and
