issuesubscribefollow usadvertisementadvertisement harry kraemer’s moment of truthin an era when the business section read like the police blotter the ceo of baxter international faced a tough ethical dilemma and he did something noteworthy he actually did the right thing by keith h hammondslong readas far as anyone knows the first few deaths occurred in madrid starting on august   advertisementthe spanish patients two men and two women were elderly and very ill all four had undergone routine dialysis at the hospital de la princesa soon after they began sweating and vomiting some of them in excruciating pain they died within a few hours of receiving treatmentnothing seemed exceptional about the deaths of those old sick patients on dialysis even though four deaths had occurred in four days at the same place hospital officials notified the manufacturers of the equipment involved as dictated by protocol but no one paid the incident much attention – until the following week when people started dying in valenciaas in madrid the six patients who died after dialysis at the clinic virgen del consuelo were mostly old and sick but they had one more thing in common it was inconclusive evidence but regional health officials told the media anyway the dialysis filters used in all of the cases had come from a single lot – the same lot as the filters used in madrid they had been manufactured by althin medical ab which had been acquired in march  by the american company baxter international incthe us business press didn’t report much on the situation news of the deaths was soon eclipsed first by the profound tragedy of september  and then by the opening bars of enron’s opera of greed and deceit over the next few weeks though a total of  deaths in the united states and six other countries would be linked circumstantially to baxter’s filters it wasn’t clear until later that the filters were to blame to this day it isn’t clear exactly what went wrongbut what was certain was this baxter and its ceo harry m jansen kraemer jr faced a moment of truth how baxter responded would leave a lasting imprint on the company’s relationships with patients and doctors with employees and of course with investors the episode would for better or worse open a window onto baxter’s corporate soulwhat did harry kraemer do he did something that feels unusual – subversive almost – in light of the air of mistrust and criminality that pervades big business “when in the past nine months have you ever heard a corporate executive apologize” marvels william w george the recently retired ceo of medicalinstrument maker medtronic inc the answer almost neveradvertisementbaxter’s response to its filter crisis wasn’t perfect but baxter’s ceo owned up to the situation he told the truth he took responsibility when it would have been easy not to his company took a  million hit and he recommended that the board reduce his bonus in other words kraemer did the right thing“there was too much there to be a coincidence” baxter international is a  billion company with  employees founded in  by dr don baxter to manufacture and distribute intravenous solutions it still sells iv bags as well as biopharmaceuticals and drugdelivery systems its products treat millions of patients a year who suffer from hemophilia infectious diseases and cancerthe thing about selling all of those drugs devices and solutions is that a lot can go wrong nearly every product that baxter delivers is a matter of life and death but when the outcome is death it can be incredibly difficult to determine a treatment’s effectiveness was the death normal and predictable or did the treatment somehow fail the answers aren’t always obvious if medicalproducts companies pulled their wares every time someone died there would be no medical productsthat is the reason why even as baxter quickly recalled the lot of filters associated with the patient deaths in spain it did not at first accept responsibility the recall was a sensible precaution no more and on october  baxter announced the results of a set of internal analyses plus another set commissioned of an independent consultant there was in fact no evidence that the dialysis filters in spain had malfunctioned in any way nor had the clinics’ water supplies been contaminated basically the deaths remained unexplainedbut that saturday morning october  alan heller checked his voice mail from his hotel in san francisco where he was attending a conference heller had joined baxter less than a year before to serve as president of its  billion renal division the althin operation acquired to complement baxter’s existing dialysis products was part of his businessthe phone message was shocking newspapers and television in croatia were reporting that  dialysis patients had died during the previous week at clinics across the country the government was blaming baxteradvertisementthe studies that were done after the deaths in spain had exonerated the dialyzers but now says heller “i knew that there was too much there to be a coincidence” the filters in croatia were probably manufactured around the same time as the ones in spain what’s more the recent deaths had occurred at six locations and the patients weren’t all elderly the clustering in two different countries was highly unusual something was wrong with the filterssuddenly baxter’s world exploded the deaths were frontpage news every day in the croatian newspapers the croatian health ministry like regional officials in valencia refused to release the used filters to baxter for testing the possibility of tampering was broachedfor heller the first decision was obvious he ordered a global recall of all of althin’s filters and a distribution hold on the ones that had already been made the action heller says cost baxter about  million “but the cost was minimal compared to the potential cost to patients if we went ahead with the product” heller says clearly too baxter’s legal liability would have been enormous if it had failed to act and more patients diedheller assigned marla persky to head an internal task force charged with confronting the debacle persky a deputy general counsel who was responsible for the renal division’s legal and government affairs had overseen the integration of the althin acquisition persky pulled in staffers worldwide from quality manufacturing toxicology marketing communications clinical affairs and other departments that evening the team of  gathered for their first conference call they would talk twice a day for the next month working to identify the gaps in their information and where they needed expertise they hired forensic toxicologists to reexamine the returned filters they combed through documents hoping to find anything – a change in the manufacturing process a new supplier perhaps different packagingand they found nothing neither did a team of european physicians assembled by baxter finally a quality engineer in althin’s ronneby sweden plant noticed something unusual about one of the recalled filters at one end of the device between the fibers and a potting compound were a few bubbles the bubbles weren’t supposed to be therea dialysis filter is a disposable product that costs less than  the technology is pretty straightforwardat althin each filter was tested several times before shipping an air test determined whether there were any leaks for the  of filters that did leak workers injected a solution to locate the problem for repair that solution was supposed to be vacuumed and evaporated from the filters but the bubbles were evidence that trace amounts of the liquid remained the solution made by m had been labeled as nontoxic – and chemically it was but when heated to body temperature in a patient’s bloodstream the toxicologists theorized it gasified causing a fatal pulmonary embolismadvertisementno one at baxter knew why the solution was removed from some filters and not others the apparent randomness made little sense “why now” persky remembers wondering “why not a year earlier why not for other manufacturers” why wasn’t the solution tested for reaction to temperature because m never intended it to come into contact with anyone’s bloodstream why was it used at ronneby because the contractor who designed the process there had done the same thing for another company why hadn’t the earlier analyses identified the problem because when technicians opened the filters for testing the trace liquid evaporated“there will always be a thousand ‘why’s” persky says now “so we had to focus on the ‘what’ ” and on november  when test results confirmed baxter’s working hypothesis the what became unavoidable rabbits injected with the m solution had nearly died exhibiting the same symptoms as the patients in spain and croatia the following morning a saturday heller called kraemer at home to lay out the situation kraemer was packing the car for a camping trip with his daughter heller reported on the animal tests and their implications he explained baxter’s options after a discussion about baxter’s likely strategy kraemer told heller “let’s make sure we do the right thing” then he went camping“what harry says he believes in” what is it exactly that makes kraemer so different from your typical bigcompany ceo he has a rumpled boyish look to him resembling the actor michael keaton in dowdy pinstripes and a buttondown shirt he is an accountant by training with an mba from northwestern’s kellogg school of management he is a midwestern native and a devout catholic he drives a toyota avalonit’s not any of that what separates kraemer from most ceos you’ve read about is this he is relentlessly authentic he tells the truth and he acts on his beliefs “there are relatively few people in the world like harry” says donald p jacobs dean emeritus at the kellogg school “harry lives his life the way most of us would like to live our lives what harry says he believes in you can put it in the bank the way he treats his coworkers is the way he’d like people to treat him”kraemer has attracted attention for his vocal insistence that he remain a deeply involved dad to his five children – and for his hope that others at baxter will get a life too but that’s just part of the deal what he’s done in a short time at baxter is change the way an entire company thinksback in  baxter international pled guilty to cooperating illegally with an arab boycott of israel that same year the us department of veterans affairs temporarily banned baxter from selling to its hospitals alleging that the company fraudulently oversold products to the government around that time baxter put forth a set of “shared values” for the company respect responsiveness and results the response would have seemed like typical corporate window dressing a predictable shallow response to public scrutiny but for the guy who directed the effort baxter’s newly appointed yearold chief financial officer harry kraemeradvertisementrespect responsiveness results – people at baxter actually believe that stuff “do the right thing” – kraemer repeats it ad nauseum so does everyone else people know what it means and it sticks that’s why kraemer could drive off that saturday confident that heller would act responsibly “if i didn’t think al would do the right thing on this one i had a much bigger issue” he saysdo the right thing “we have this situation” kraemer continues describing the filter crisis “the financial people will assess the potential financial impact the legal people will do the same but at the end of the day if we think it’s a problem that a baxter product was involved in the deaths of  people then those other issues become pretty easy if we don’t do the right thing then we won’t be around to address those other issues“i’m not a very smart guy so let’s keep it simple think of any problem you need to deal with there are a million pieces of information that can get involved in a decision but let’s get above the tree line and ask some simple questions what is the issue what are the alternatives what are the pros and cons what is the best solution life is complex but you can boil the morass down to thinking simply”“this problem will never happen again” baxter could have ducked the blame it could have pulled the filters ever so quietly from the market – and since the line accounted for less than  million in revenue it’s likely that few would have noticed with some justification it could have blamed althin’s former owner since baxter had only recently taken over the business it could have blamed m for that matter it could have faulted the lack of cooperation from croatian and valencian authoritiestoo often that is how it works in business “you bring in lawyers and pr companies and you find ways to say ‘this is not our fault’ ” says brad googins executive director of the center for corporate citizenship at boston college companies and their executives duck shirk and deny and in doing so they destroy truston november   baxter announced that it had identified the probable cause of the dialysispatient deaths in a press release kraemer made this statement “we are greatly saddened by the patient deaths and i would like to extend my personal sympathies to family members of those patients we have a responsibility to make public our findings immediately and take swift action even though confirmatory studies remain under way”advertisementbaxter could have stopped selling only the  of filters that needed repair after all those were the only ones in which the solution had been used but the tragedy had compromised the entire althin brand and baxter didn’t have all of the facts it never did see the filters from croatia perhaps some patients had died from filters that hadn’t been exposed to the solution “were we  confident” kraemer asks “no we didn’t know”so baxter shut down althin for good it closed the factory in ronneby and another in florida it took a charge to earnings of  million to cover the costs of the closure and its anticipated settlements with the families of patients who had died by year’s end it would pay the spanish families a reported  each the company won’t confirm the amount or disclose the sums paid to families in croatia who also have settled the lone suit involving an american patient has also been resolved the plaintiff’s attorney in the case kenneth moll says that baxter “behaved appropriately and responsibly”the next day kraemer and heller flew to washington dc to brief officials at the food and drug administration on the company’s findings and its plan of action baxter executives had similar conversations with regulators in spain croatia and other affected countries baxter had warned m of the problem over the weekend it also had reported the problem with the dialysis filters to rival manufacturers it knew or suspected were using the same processin the months that followed baxter searched through records for hundreds of thousands of its products and product parts looking for processes that might resemble the faulty one at ronneby it added steps to qualify any material used in manufacturing even if that material wasn’t designed to stay in the end product “this made us secondguess systems that we’d had for  years and that had always worked” persky says adds jose divino the associate medical director who had been baxter’s point man in spain and croatia “what we know for sure is this problem will never happen again”and there was one more thing kraemer recommended that the compensation committee of baxter’s board of directors reduce his performance bonus by at least  for  in the end he

the hit and guess what the world didn’t end the company’s stock dropped slightly on news of the charge to earnings but soon recovered “baxter didn’t try to assign blame away” says david lothson an analyst who follows baxter for ubs warburg llc “it showed signs of dealing with it decisively rather than letting it drag on investors tend to react very favorably to that”advertisementthe message to ceos investors like honesty including public apologies kraemer visited new york to apologize in person to the president of croatia so it turns out do employees kraemer was flooded with appreciative emails and phone messages from baxter workers as for customers heller admits that his renal business has dropped off in europe – but he hopes to win that back too “we violated the physicians’ trust” he says “it wasn’t intentional but our product failed we have to rebuild that trust“in the short run” heller allows “our results are probably worse for the way we handled things but in the long run they’ll be better bad ethics and bad judgment ultimately come back to burn you” of course good ethics don’t guarantee safe passage either at press time the fda announced that on september   baxter notified hemodialysis centers that tubing and needles used with its dialysis machines might have been linked to five deaths in the united states in late augustnearly a year after the first death in spain kraemer sits in his office pondering the aftermath to him there is nothing extraordinary about what baxter has done this is simply how organizations and their people should behave “simplicity” he says “open communication of values” respect responsiveness results “over and over and over again” if the values are authentic then so are the decisions and the actionshe pauses then finishes the thought “of course we’ll do the right thing” he says “as opposed to what”sidebar what’s fastconfidence and humility handcuffs have replaced cuff links as the most visible wrist wear for ceos – which makes baxter international ceo harry kraemer’s philosophy of leadership all the more refreshing“leadership is a delicate blend of selfconfidence and humility you have to have the selfconfidence to say ‘you don’t want to make that decision without my input’advertisement“but selfconfidence without humility becomes a problem i may be the ceo but part of that was having a few skills and part of it was luck part of it was the man upstairs so i’m no better than anyone else selfconfidence and humility blend those two together and you have someone who has a good chance of leading effectivelyninetynine
