legislation requiring dog owners not only to clean up after their pet but also to carry a device for performing this taskaccording to a ralston purina pet owner study dog owners cite cleaning up after their dog as one of the primary challenges of owning a dog unfortunately currently available dog waste cleanup products are crudely designed and cumbersome to operate leaving many dog owners
