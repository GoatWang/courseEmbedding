tablets how much will microsofts surface tablet cost the big question is whether microsofts beautifully designed surface tablet will sell well but thats impossible to predict without knowing its price by john c dvorak june   pm est june   view all photos in gallery microsoft held an event yesterday in hollywood and as far as i can tell only invited those who would cover the event with a positive spin i for example was not invited then the company insulted the invitees by withholding the location of the eventwhich turned out to be milk studiosuntil about six hours before it began the idea was to create an applelike event with an applelike product and according to attendees it was peopled by microsoft shills who whooped it up just like the apple folks do at their events we actually need less of these pretentious events microsoft did in fact reveal a cool product it apparently went out of its way to throw off the it has no taste albatross and rolled out an incredible tablet device that is in the same designer heavyweight league as not apple but bang  olufsen ladies and gentlemen i bring you the surface a tablet ultrabook thingee congratulations microsoft you went over the top with this one you proved you could hang with the big design dogs woof woof woof most of the preevent speculation did not predict branded microsoft hardware mine did though since i knew the company needed something to show off at the microsoft stores that are cropping up everywhere so it has this in october i expect more and more branded products coming in the next year all to sell at the stores nobody anywhere apparently had any connections to any companies making the highlight of the evening the touchcover which turns the pad into an ersatz ultrabook its a clever idea that has the bonus of inviting carpal tunnel syndrome and lawsuits but the company can deal with that by using a warning sticker the question is not whether microsoft knocked it out of the park designwise because it is a grandslam nor is the question why it rolled this out in hollywood though the venue did generate some buzz the real question is whether these things will sell i hope to god they sell like hotcakes so microsoft will maintain a high standard for design but i fear the opposite expensivelooking design has a drawback it is generally expensive thats kind of the problem to keep the prices reasonable one must employ a lot of cheap tricks like using glue inside to mount components im looking at you apple from the looks of it there are no cheap tricks with this device the biggest complaint from live bloggers at the event is that no price was announced all microsoft could say was that it would be competitive but competitive with what a burger king cheeseburger view all photos in gallery ballmer has never been one for lowballing the competition he cannot bring himself to do it hes a multibillionaire who is out of touch with the public he doesnt mingle anymore hes the perfect customer for bang  olufsen ill bet that the price well have to pay for this surface machine will be disappointing and the sales will be meager im hoping i am wrong this much is for sure if microsoft took an early beating by pricing the lowend surface running windows  rt at  and the highend intel machine at  it would blow out the market and make up for it in volume sales but if i were to guess the prices for the two units based on the crazy desire to make a profit on zero sales i suspect the lowend tablet with keyboard will go for  and the highend machine will tip the scales at  or more unless the economy improves by  the great experiment in highend industrial design will fall flat and these devices will wind up in the museum of modern art you can follow john c dvorak on twitter therealdvorak more john
