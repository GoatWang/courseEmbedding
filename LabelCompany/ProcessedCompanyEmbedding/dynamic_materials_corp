perspectives explosionwelded cladding technology is a method to weld metals that cannot be welded by conventional processes such as titaniumsteel aluminumsteel and aluminumcopper it can also be used to weld compatible metals such as stainless steels and nickel alloys to steel the cladding metals are typically titanium stainless steel aluminum copper alloys nickel alloys tantalum and zirconium the base metals are typically carbon steel alloy steel stainless steel and aluminum although the patents for the explosionwelded cladding process have expired dmc clad has proprietary knowledge that distinguishes it from its competitors the entire explosionwelding process involves significant precision in all stages and any errors can be extremely costly as they result in the discarding of the expensive raw material metals dmc clads technological expertise is a significant advantage in preventing costly waste history of dynamic materials corporation dynamic materials corporation dmc is a global leader in explosive metalworking it also employs other metalworking processes such as underwater forming machining and rolling the company started out as a licensee of duponts technology to bond layers of dissimilar metals then later acquired duponts explosive cladding operations these materials are used to make large pressurized chemical holding tanks autoclaves heat exchangers and other equipment used in the petrochemicals industry the amk welding division performs specialized contract welding services for makers of aircraft engines and power generators a little more than half of dmcs sales came from north america in  in addition to its colorado headquarters the company has operations in pennsylvania france and sweden origins the phenomenon of microfusion was observed as early as world war i when bullets were fired into armor plates to join dissimilar metals that were not able to be welded by conventional methods this also was observed in the remnants of bombedout bridges in world war ii ei dupont de nemours  co the chemicals giant pioneered the practical application of explosive welding and discovered its detaclad explosionweld clad process in  in this a thin layer of explosive powder was ignited to join two layers of different metals by force not heat the metal sheets were set up with small gaps between them the pressure of the explosion swept a layer of oxides and other contaminants from the surface of the plates so that the metals joined at a molecular level denver aerospace firm martin marietta licensed the technology using it to form jet engine parts in  a group of colorado investors formed explosive fabricators inc efi which acquired martin mariettas explosive cladding business the main use of cladding was to retain or improve the properties of a highperformance metal such as titanium nickel copper or stainless steel while keeping costs down with a cheap base metal such as carbon steel the result was ideal for making enormous storage tanks for holding chemicals under pressure as well as heat exchangers efi also had the dynaform process though this would account for only a fraction of revenues the process involved using underwater shock waves to push a metal sheet onto a die this resulted in extremely high tolerances due to the even diffusion of force through the water it was used to produce precision parts for the aerospace industry boeing company became a leading client and the process was used to make nose cones for the trident missile efi was incorporated in colorado on march   the companys headquarters was in lafayette with the explosive operations a twohour drive away in deer trail in eastern arapahoe county efi went public in  under the nasdaq ticker symbol boom dmc was reincorporated as a delaware corporation on may   sales were  million in  the company ended the s with record annual revenues of  million efi landed a major new contract to produce tenfoot engine intake rings for boeing company by this time efi had about  employees an executive told american metal market that the company then had a  percent share of the explosive cladding market a new dynamic in  efi hired a new president

materials corporation in december  the company had added a ton hydraulic metal press capable of producing three million pounds of force revenues were up to  million in  when dmc had  employees dmc bought its main rival duponts detaclad operations for  million in july  this business based in pennsylvania had been dmcs only significant us rival with annual sales of  million in  the acquisition which was the companys first ever made dmc the largest explosive cladding operation in the world its sole competition came from firms in france and japan and the technical and financial barriers to entry were considerable part of the detaclad operations included an explosive technology for making synthetic industrial diamonds buying out the competition was a shrewd strategic move raising dmcs share of the domestic market for explosionclad metals to  percent the companys income was reaching new highs and its stock price quadrupled within  months in august  dmc announced its largest order to date a contract to supply a manufacturer of mining autoclaves in australia under langes five years in charge the company became more market oriented it also made greater efforts to attract interest in its stock from the investment community dmc was becoming more vertically integrated while keeping its newly acquired taste for acquisitions it acquired equipment from its neighbor coors to allow it to perform its own seam welding a spokesperson told boulders daily camera building the aerospace segment in  dmc built up an aerospace segment in  starting with the january acquisition of el segundo californias spin forge llc which produced housings for missile motors and titanium tanks spin forge had been a division of dynamic materials paul lange stepped down in september  and was replaced as

pmp the aerospace segment was making up a third of dmcs business but it was growing quickly and accounted for more than half of gross profits at the time the asian financial crisis was slowing down a number of capital projects that used materials from the companys explosive cladding business in  dmc closed its plant in louisville colorado and moved the operations there to a new facility it was building in dunbar pennsylvania the site of the old detaclad facility the company kept its headquarters in lafayette colorado however this left dmc with a single site for explosion weld cladding its operations there involved setting off a few tons of explosives inside mountain caves on a daily basis in june  dmc announced that it was selling off the explosive cladding business for  million in order to focus on the aerospace industry specifically the defense and satellite segment the prospective buyer ametek inc backed out of the sale a few months later however french control  frances stateowned groupe snpe sociăštăš nationale de poudres et explosifs sa had begun buying dmc shares in the spring of  and acquired a majority holding in the company in june  snpe paid  million to raise its holding from  percent to  percent and loaned another  million over five years groupe snpe a large aerospace defense and chemicals conglomerate already owned the largest clad metal operation in france snpe installed its own ceo but retained allwein in a highlevel executive post bernard fontana head of the us subsidiary snpe inc also led dmc until yvon pierre cariou the former ceo of metal fabricator astrocosmos metallurgical inc was designated dmcs president and ceo in november  the company soon relocated its headquarters from lafayette colorado to boulder dmc lost  million on revenues of  million in  this was accompanied by a considerable drop in share price the petrochemical industry was showing signs of recovery however due to rising oil prices and the company was logging record orders as energy firms renovated their plants with new equipment in  dmc acquired nobelclad europe sa and its subsidiary nitro metall aktiebolag from nobel explosifs france the acquisition which was financed by  million borrowed from snpe added operations in rivesaltes france and likenas sweden with combined annual sales of  million in contrast to its strategy of several years prior dmc divested a couple of its aerospace units to focus on the core explosive cladding and explosive forming businesses the pmp unit in fort collins colorado was sold in october  spin forge the california aerospace
