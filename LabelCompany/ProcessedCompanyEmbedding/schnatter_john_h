in combination with leveler device  thus repeating desired amounts of a particular product or ingredient for a food application permits consistency in a products taste appearance and quality and furthers repeatability within a single store and among a franchise that includes multiple storesas shown in fig  leveler device  includes a center arm  between two arms  engaging a container  container  may hold a variety of bulk products including but is not limited to food ingredients that may have a variety of characteristics including but not limited to solids and semisolids container  includes a bottom wall  and a sidewall  sidewall  defines a container opening  surrounded by a container rim  permitting access to the contents of the container although container  may generally have a bucket shape it is not limited to such and may be of a variety of shapes that best contain the product or have the greatest aesthetic appeal container  may be of unitary construction and made of any of numerous materials commonly known in the art depending on specific product and environmental conditions some common examples of materials include but are not limited to polyethylene polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate the container described above is merely representative of containers in general and it is to be understood that there are a variety of containers of different shape size and rim finish that may be used with the leveler device embodiments hereinas shown in figs  leveler device  is an elongated bar or member that includes a center arm  with opposing arms  that may be inclined with an attachment mechanism  of inclined arms  at a lower first elevation adjacent container rim  center arm  with planar wall  is at a higher second elevation in a vertical direction away from container opening  this vertical distance or clearance between container rim  or first elevation and planar wall  at the second elevation allows measuring device  to be inserted into the product  of container  as well as being brought into contact with the planar wall  as it is removed from container  to level off the product in the measuring device inclined arms  extend radially outward away from center arm  and depend at an angle a wherein angle a may be about but is not limited to  degrees planar wall  of center arm  includes a lower scraping edge b and an upper edge a with a forward planar surface c and a rearward planar surface d therebetween as shown in fig  the scraping angle  between either the forward or rearward planar surface c d and container rim  is preferably about  degrees although it is understood that the scraping angle may be less than or greater than  degrees for either planar surfaces and still adequately level the product  in the measuring device  upper

scraping edge b may have a smaller width w the opposing ends  and  of planar wall  extend longitudinally and may connect with the opposing inclined arms  as shown in fig leveler device  may be constructed of one or more materials by a variety of processes such as injection molding leveler device  may be of unitary construction and may be made of any of numerous materials commonly known in the art depending on specific product and environmental conditions some common examples of materials include but are not limited to polyethylene polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalatealthough leveler device  is shown in detail in figs  it should be understood to those skilled in the art that the leveler planar wall and arms may be a variety of quantities shape construction sizes positions relative to the container and still adequately provide the desired leveling of the product for a variety of measuring devices for instance although it is shown that forward and rearward planar surfaces c d of wall  are planar and parallel to each other the planar surfaces may relate differently to each other such as being tapered nonplanar such as arcuate or otherwise dissimilar to each other further planar wall  or more specifically one or more planar surfaces of the planar wall may be angled relative to the container rim  instead of being perpendicular to the container rim as is shown in fig  therefore scraping angle θ may be varied from the approximately right angle shown in fig  also the first end  of planar wall  may be vertically offset from the other opposing end  of the planar wall  relative to container rim  whereby the center arm  will not be parallel with container rim  further planar wall  may extend along only a portion of the center arm  and may or may not connect with one or both of the inclined arms as shown in figs  the distal ends a of one or both of inclined arms  may include an attachment mechanism or mounting bracket  for securing the leveler device  to container  although it is contemplated that attachment mechanism  may affix the leveler device permanently to container  or the leveler device may be integrally molded with the container to form a unitary structure leveler device  is shown as being releasably secured to container  therefore leveler device  may be separated from container  to allow either the container or leveler to be cleaned repaired replaced or to allow the container to be more readily emptied or refilled with product a toolfree attachment mechanism or pair of mounting brackets as shown allows the user to readily engage and disengage leveler device  from container  as desired by the user one embodiment of attachment mechanism  includes an upper deck  with one or more depending walls as shown in figs  attachment mechanism  has an exterior depending wall or outer wall  and an interior depending wall or inner wall  outer wall  may engage depending on the shape of container  one or more exterior surfaces b of container sidewall  and inner wall  may engage one or more interior surfaces a of container sidewall  outer wall  and inner wall  define a groove  for receiving container rim  groove  may be arcuate in shape when used with a container having an arcuate rim however outer wall  andor inner wall  may or may not be arcuate therefore it should be understood that the groove  may be provided in a variety of shapes construction and sizes to match the rim  to which it is applied as shown in fig  the interior surface of outer wall  may be curved with a first radius measured from the central axis of the container opening  although not shown the inner wall may also have a curved exterior surface having a second radius similarly measured whereby the second radius is smaller than first radius the inner and outer walls  and  may each have one or more depending protrusions or ribs for instance inner wall  as shown in fig  may have three protrusions a b and c engaging interior surface a of container sidewall  opposing protrusions a and c are positioned on the outer periphery of upper deck  with protrusion b therebetween protrusion b may connect to planar wall  along inclined arm although the latching mechanism  of the attachment mechanism  may be disengaged by a tool a latch  which may be manually operated without a tool is shown in figs  and  latch  extends from a depressible member or push button  pivotable about a hinged connection or hinge  hinge  may be a living type hinge pin and slot mechanism bimodal wherein the hinge snaps the latch either in a fully engaged or fully disengaged position with the container rim one integral structure as shown or include two or more connected structures or may be a variety of hinges known to one skilled in the art and still provide pivoting andor flexing of latch  in order to engage and disengage from the container in one embodiment latch  extends from outer wall  of attachment mechanism  through slot a slot a may extend through portions of outer wall  andor portions of upper deck  latch  allows the leveler device  to engage and disengage from a latch catch or retainer  of container rim  latch  includes a cam surface or ramp  although it should be understood that the cam surface may be included with the container rim cam surface  of the latch mechanism  allows latch  to be displaced radially outward from groove  about hinge  while container rim  is being inserted into groove  once cam surface  of latch  continues flexing or pivoting latch  past the container rim latch  returns inwardly into to the groove to engage latch catch  of container rim  as shown in figs  and  by depressing push button  when the latch  is already engaged with the container rim  the user displaces latch  radially outward away from container latch catch  to disengage the latch from its engaged position with the container figs  and  to remove the leveler device it should also be understood that the leveler device  may be rotationally andor axially fixed relative to the container rim by the attachment mechanisms andor container structurealthough attachment mechanism  is shown in detail in the figures a variety of attachment or mounting mechanisms may be used to assemble the leveler device to the container causing it to be either permanently or releasably secured although not shown the leveler device or more specifically the attachment mechanism inclined arms or center arm may allow for pivoting possibly about the longitudinal axis of the elongated leveler device from a first position to a second position that may adjust the scraping angle  of the leveler device as desired by the user further the leveler device or a single inclined arm  may have an attachment mechanism  while the other arm merely engages and receives the container rimthe measuring device ladle or spoon  is shown in figs  and  measuring device  includes a handle  connected to a bowl  having an opening surrounded by a rim  the amount of product is dependent on the volume contained within the measuring device  upon leveling or scraping off the excess amount of product when using the leveler a variety of measuring devices may be used that receive a predetermined amount of product depending on the desired application of the product for example when preparing a variety of pizzas of a different size a user may use one measuring device to measure out more sauce for a large pizza and another smaller measuring device to measure out a smaller amount of sauce for a small pizzaas shown in figs  and  in use the user chooses the appropriately sized measuring device  and scoops up a measure of product or sauce  with excess product a extending above measuring device rim  as shown in fig  the user  then levels off the amount of product  within the measuring device  by scraping the measuring device rim  against lower scraping edge b of the leveler planar wall  in the “a” direction to remove the excess product a measuring device  can be used against lower scraping edge b in either direction “a” or the opposing direction wherein the excess product a may contact either the forward planar surface c or the rearward planar surface d depending on which side the user  is positioned relative to the leveler device the excess product a that is scraped or pushed off of the measuring device rim by the scraping blade returns or falls back into container  thereby allowing the user to scrape and pour the predetermined amount in each subsequent applicationwhile several inventive embodiments have been described
