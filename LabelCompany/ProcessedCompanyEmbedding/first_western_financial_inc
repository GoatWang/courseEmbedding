education and access is extremely limited we support organizations that help both local artists and also introduce children and adults to a broader cultural experience as a way to inspire new ideas and new ways of thinking women  girls studies have shown that when communities put money and time into women and girls they achieve a multiplier effect with those women reinvesting in the community
