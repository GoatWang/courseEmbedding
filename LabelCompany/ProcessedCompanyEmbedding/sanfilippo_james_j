the invention relates to improved apparatus and method for exposing product including food product semiconductors and any product that has an adverse reaction to air to a controlled environment more particularly this invention relates to improved apparatus and process for replacing air in product andor containers with a desired controlled environment including inert gas combinations of gases and other aromas mists moisture etcvarious products including food product semiconductor products and any other product that has an adverse reaction to air are packaged in a controlled environment various attempts have been made to efficiently package these products in controlled environments using vacuum andor controlled environmentvarious food products including bakery goods meats fruits vegetables etc are packaged under atmospheric conditions many of these products are presented in supermarkets for example in cartons or cardboard containers with a plastic or cellophane wrap covering the productone problem with this type of packaging is that the goods have a minimum limited shelf life which for many products is only several days to a week with bakery goods for example mold may begin to grow after a few days under atmospheric conditions such products obviously cannot be sold or consumed and must be discardedanother problem arises with respect to many fruits and vegetables which continue to ripen and continue their metabolic process under atmospheric conditions for example within a few days a banana can become overripe and undesirable to the consumerthe space available for gassing operations is often limited at many facilities in general existing controlled environment systems are often expensive bulky and require three phase power and accordingly are impractical for use at many of these facilitiesin an effort to alleviate these problems various attempts have been made to package food in a controlled environment by injecting controlled environment directly into filled containers a high velocity flow is often necessary to penetrate into the food product in general these attempts have proved unsuccessful with bakery goods for example the high velocity jets pull in air and recontaminate the product thereby failing to reduce the oxygen to levels that would prevent the normal onset of moldvarious techniques for removing air in food filling processes are known in the art such processes are used for example in the packaging of nuts coffee powdered milk cheese puffs infant formula and various other dry foods typically dry food containers are exposed to a controlled environment flush andor vacuum for a period of time subsequent to filling but prior to sealing the product may also be flushed with a controlled environment prior to filling or may be flushed after the filling process when the oxygen has been substantially removed from the food contents therein the containers are sealed with or without vacuum various techniques are also known for replacing the atmosphere of packaged meats products with a modified atmosphere of carbon dioxide oxygen and nitrogen andor other gases or mixtures of gases to extend shelf lifea gas flushing apparatus for removing oxygen from food containers is disclosed in us patent no  issued to domke a conveyor belt carries the open top containers in a direction of movement directly below a gas flushing device the gas flushing device supplies controlled environment to the containers in two ways first a layer or blanket of low velocity flushing gas is supplied to the entire region immediately above and including the open tops of the containers through a distributing plate having a plurality of small openings second each container is purged using a high velocity flushing gas jet supplied through a plurality of larger jet openings arranged sidebyside in a direction perpendicular to the direction of movement of the food containers as the containers move forward in the direction of movement the steps of controlled environment blanketing followed by jet flushing can be repeated a number of times until sufficient oxygen has been removed from the containers and from the food contents thereinone aspect of the apparatus disclosed in domke is that the flow of gas in a container is constantly changing the high velocity streams are directed through perpendicular openings in a plate which creates eddies near the openings causing turbulence which pulls in outside air as a container moves past the perpendicular row of high velocity jets the jets are initially directed downward into the container at the leading edge of the container open top as the container moves further forward the flushing gas is directed into the center and later into the trailing edge of the open top after which the container clears the row of jets before being exposed to the next perpendicular row of jets the process is repeated as the container passes below the next row of jetsthe apparatus disclosed in domke is directed at flushing empty containers and in effect relies mainly on a dilution process to decrease oxygen levels one perpendicular row of jets per container pitch is inadequate to efficiently remove air container in food productanother apparatus for flushing gas from containers is disclosed in usa a conveyor belt carries open top containers in a direction of movement directly below a gas flushing device the gas flushing device supplies inert gas to the container in two ways first a central downward flow of cryogenic inert gas is directed into the container second a peripheral flow of ambient inert gas is directed towards the outside top portion of the container to prevent frosting of the containerconstantly changing jet patterns in prior art devices create turbulence above and within the containers which can cause surrounding air to be pulled into the containers by the jets this turbulence also imposes a limitation on the speed at which the containers pass below the jets as the containers move faster beneath the jets the flow patterns within the containers change faster and the turbulence increases also at high line speeds purging gas has more difficulty going down into the containers because of the relatively shorter residence time in contact with each high velocity row the purging gas also has a greater tendency to remain in the head space above the containers in addition a perpendicular arrangement of jets relative to the direction of container travel causes much of the jet to be directed outside the containers especially when the containers are round moreover the spacing apart of the perpendicular rows may further vary the flow pattern and pull outside air into the containersit would desirable to have a gassing system that would replace the air within a container or food product with a controlled environment of higher purity which would greatly increase the shelf life of the productthe invention provides apparatus for exposing product to an inert environment prior to packaging including a distribution chamber an inlet in the distribution chamber for receiving controlled environment from a source a region of flow resistance formed in the chamber and a jet manifold to longitudinally supply controlled environment through the distribution chamber the jet manifold including a plurality of jet nozzles positioned adjacent to and surrounded

rectangular as shown in figs  and may be constructed of stainless steel aluminum rigid plastic or any other rigid material chamber  should preferably be at least as wide and more preferably somewhat wider than the product or container opening  chamber  may also be narrower than the product or container opening but under certain conditions this may allow outside air to contaminate the product andor container structure or other means may be combined with the narrower chamber to maintain the controlled environment the length of the chamber  may vary depending on the desired line speed and minimum residence time underneath chamber  for each container or product  also a plurality of chambers  may be arranged lengthwise in series to create a greater effective length the actual length or number of distribution chambers  required will depend on various factors including conveyor speed container and product volume and product typefor a given residence time the maximum line speed increases as the length of chamber  is increased for the embodiment described above a preferred line speed for gassing for example most bakery products is approximately  containers per minute which have for example a length of  cm  inches a width of  cm  inches and a depth of  cm  inches  metres  ft per minute of conveyor speed and requires approximately  metres  ft of effective chamber lengththe height adjusting apparatus  provides the operator an efficient means of lowering the rail  to a desired level from various sized packages and products it also allows the rail  to be quickly removed for cleaning the adjusting members  each include adjustment knob  vertical threaded shaft  horizontal mounting shaft  base plate  horizontal adjustment handle  plunger  thumb screw  and

attached to the inner end of shaft  shaft  extends through receptical  and may be adjusted by loosening adjuster  and then horizontally sliding shaft  to the desired position receptical  has an inner flange portion  for retaining the receptical within the opening  formed through sidewalls  preferably the vertical distance between the bottom of chamber  and the product or container is small and should not exceed about  cm  inches preferably this vertical distance is between about  mm  and about  mm  inches and most preferably between about   and about  mm  inches these reduced gap distances provide for optimal results with minimum gas usagethe sidewalls   aid in preventing outside air from entering the purging area and increase the efficiency of the system the sidewalls   also act to force the gas which includes the air flushed from the container andor product and controlled environment to exit through the entrance where the gas may be collected a gasket  including any foodsafe sealing material may also be used in combination with sidewalls   to further seal the system from the outside environmenta horizontal sealing station  is preferably positioned at the end of the rail section  to achieve the desired controlled environment other types of rail and sealing arrangements may also be utilized including rails which may run in an upward andor downward direction and vertical or rotary sealing stations preferably one or more high velocity sections  are followed by one or more lower velocity sections  prior to sealing the container however when sidewalls   are used for example with a sealer  and conveyer  which are designed to prevent infiltration of air a complete rail with high velocity sections may be used without the need for a low velocity sectionreferring to figs  the chamber  has a top portion  and bottom portion  formed in the top portion  of chamber section  is a first inlet  for receiving controlled environment from a first source not shown and a second inlet  from a second source not shown inlet  allows gas to be supplied to the inner cavity  of the distribution chamber  the second inlet  connects to a jet flow tube distribution manifold  which includes a rectangular frame  which fits over screens   five distribution tubes  extend over a plurality of openings    formed in screens   and openings   formed in the bottom portion  of the distribution chamber referring to figs  a preferred resistance region includes screens   overlying the openings   formed in the bottom portion  of the distribution chamber in the embodiment of figs  equally spaced rows of openings  are formed in the bottom of the chamber  center openings  are preferably slots having a  mm  inch width the outside rows are staggered with  mm  inch diameter circular openings  spaced  cm  inch between centers this arrangement is designed for providing consistent contact of the very high velocity controlled environment streams with the product the distance between the outer two rows of circular openings may be approximately as wide as the product or container the bottom portion of the chamber  may alternatively include greater or lesser number of openings depending on the type of product line speed etc the openings  may also be arranged in equally spaced parallel rows rather than in staggered rows as shown in fig  alternatively the center slots  may be formed as one long slot through a section of chamber arrangements and number of the openings   may be altered to meet the requirements of product with varying sizes and consistenciestop screen  is preferably formed from a fiveply wire screen having a hole size of between about  microns in the above embodiment the circular openings  have diameters of  mm  inch and center slots  with matching  mm  inch widths the bottom screen  is preferably formed from a ply wire screen having a hole size of preferably  microns the bottom screen  in the preferred embodiment of figs  has preferably  staggered rows of circular openings  with diameters of  mm  inches and spaced  cm  inches between centersas shown in figs  and  jet manifold  is supplied with controlled environment from a second source through inlet  which aligns with opening  as shown in fig  alternatively inlet  could serve as the sole inlet with an alternative jet manifold design which provides for spaced openings  in tubes  to allow controlled environment to flow into the distribution chamber  the openings may be formed in some or all of the tubes  and may be in the top or sides and spaced at varying distances for various product and resistance regionsas shown in figs  and  the rectangular frame  of the jet manifold  fits over the perimeter of the top screen  in a preferred embodiment five tubes  extend longitudinally over the rows of openings   extending from the tubes are very high velocity nozzles  having an od of approximately  mm  inch an id of between about  mm  inch and a length which allows the nozzle to extend through top screen openings   and bottom screen opening  preferably as shown in fig  the nozzle does not extend beyond the bottom of chamber  to facilitate cleaning of the chamber bottom  and to avoid damage to nozzles  during operation or cleaning tolerances of approximately  or  mm  inches are held between screens   and jet manifold  which can be easily removed from the chamber  for cleaning simpler configurations are possible which do not require close tolerance but may not be as easily reassembled or mass produced as shown in figs  and  chamber  is preferably sealed with an oring  which extends along the perimeter of screens   and frame  of jet manifold  to seal chamber  as shown in figs  and  top portion  and bottom portion  of the distribution chamber  have a plurality of threaded openings   spaced along their perimeter for sealing the chamber  in the embodiment of figs  and  oring  extends around both sections of chamber  in operation for the embodiment shown in figs  controlled environment or combination of gases is used for example to prolong product freshness or inhibit bacterial growth the gas enters distribution chamber  through inlet  which is in communication with opening  formed in top portion  of chamber  the controlled environment flows through screens  and  and screen openings    and chamber openings   simultaneously controlled environment enters through a second inlet  which communicates with opening  formed in jet manifold  and passes through tubes  and nozzles  the gas stream from nozzles  is of a high velocity in the range of for example  metressec  ftsec or from  metressec  ftsec up to sonic speeds speed of sound the high velocity jet flow is designed to impinge upon the product andor interior of the container as the product is moved along conveyor  to sealing station  this extremely high velocity flow will generally actually penetrate into the product to replace air entrapped within and around the product the lower velocity and preferably laminarized flow surrounding the high velocity jet flow substantially prevents outside air from being pulled into the container andor productthe gas stream exiting chamber  has a much lower velocity as shown in fig  the outer region of the flow profile  has the lowest velocity because the controlled environment passes through both screens   the next region of flow passes only through the bottom screen  and has a slightly higher flow velocity preferably the next flow region which is directly around the nozzle has no resistance and has a slightly higher velocity than the two outer regions this flow profile with a lower velocity flow surrounding the very high velocity flow exiting the jet nozzles  substantially prevents outside air from being pulled back into the container and product the quadruple flow profile as shown in fig  may alternatively be modified as shown in fig  to a triple flow profile  by eliminating the top screen  alternatively for some product including nuts providing flow only through the center slot  with one or both screens   and the center tube  may be adequate to achieve the desired controlled environment for sealing or packaging the productalternatively as shown in fig  shortened nozzles  may be used with a screen  which is similar to screen  without openings to provide a dual flow profile  both top and bottom screens   may also be eliminated as shown in fig  to provide an alternative dual flow profile  various other flow profiles which provide for a lower velocity flow surrounding a very high velocity flow may also alternatively be created by altering the number of screens and openingsit is preferable for gassing rail  to have a distribution chamber or section thereof that provides only a lower velocity flow of controlled environment preferably a laminarized flow as shown in fig  providing a low velocity flow to the section  of chamber  preceding entry the sealing station  aids in preventing air from being pulled into the product or container  over the end of chamber  which is adjacent the sealing station  as shown in fig  the section  may be constructed similar to rail section  described above the desired lower velocity gassing effect is achieved by shutting off the source of controlled environment to inlet  which supplies the jet flow tube manifold  of rail section  alternatively section  may be altered as shown in fig  to have a bottom chamber portion  having only slots  formed therethrough alternatively as shown in fig  the jet manifold  may be removed altogether to achieve the triple low velocity flow profile  alternatively as shown in fig  lower screen  may be replaced with screen  which has no openings bored therethrough to create the low velocity flow profile  referring to fig  the top screen  may be removed to provide the single flow profile  other variations of longitudinally oriented regions of flow resistance may be created by altering the number and type of mesh screens porous materials or other resistancetype sheets fig  may be used in either a low or high velocity section when used in a high velocity flow section an orifice  formed through a resistance material  provides high velocity flow the resistance material  is preferably sintered metaltype material but may be any material that will provide a sufficient reduced velocity flow and preferably a laminarized flow with the design of fig  a jet manifold is not useda series of tests were conducted that confirm the desirability of this gassing rail system referring to fig  a  metres  ft gassing rail  having two  cm  ft sections   was placed on the top of conveyor  leaving a clearance of  mm  inches between the bottom of the chamber  and the top of the container  the conveyer  was operated at cm  inches per secondone series of tests were conducted with tubs having  cm  inch lengths and  cm  inch widths filled with miniature powdered donuts the tubs fit into cutout openings in the conveyer which allowed for the top of the tubs to be flush with the top of the conveyer the area beneath the gassing rail was not closed there were no sidewalls   used in this series of tests in addition there were openings in the conveyer chain which allowed outside air access to the gas flushing area after passing through both sections   of the gassing rail the tubs entered a sealing station  first a layer of plastic covered the tub openings next the plastic sheet was heat sealed to the tub and then the plastic between tubs was cut an oxygen sensor was used to determine the oxygen residual in the sealed tubs in the first test test a nitrogen gas was provided to distribution manifold  through inlets   and to jet manifolds   through inlets   the average oxygen residuals for test a were approximately  percent this is an undesirable oxygen residual for many products including baked goods and would not adequately inhibit mold growth or prevent oxidative rancidityin the second test test b the nitrogen gas was fed only through the distribution chamber inlets   the source of gas to jet manifold inlets   was turned off the average oxygen residual for test b was  percent this was a better residual than test a however it would also not adequately inhibit mold growth or prevent oxidative ranciditya third test test c was run under preferred operating conditions gas was provided to distribution chamber  and jet manifold  in the first section  and was provided to the distribution chamber only in the second section  the gas supply to jet manifold  in second section  was shut off this resulted in average oxygen residuals of approximately  percent at this level of residual oxygen mold growth should be substantially if not completely inhibitedsimilar tests were run with packages of two chocolate cupcakes in this series of tests  ft of rail was used with the chamber having only center slot openings  the two layers of screen   having openings   as described above were positioned along the center slot openings  nozzles from jet manifold  extended through the screen openings   spaced at  cm  inches between centers gas to jet manifold was turned off for a  cm  ft section of rail immediately preceding the sealing station  this resulted in average oxygen residuals in the sealed cupcakes of between  and  percent when the gas to the jet manifold was turned off for the entire  metres  ft length of rail the average oxygen residuals rose to an average range of about    percentwhile the embodiments of the invention disclosed herein are presently considered to be
