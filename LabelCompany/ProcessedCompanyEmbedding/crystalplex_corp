patent and trademark office uspto issued u s patent no  passivated nanoparticles assigned to crystalplex the patent which claims the fabrication and use of sapphire™ quantum dots or passivated quantum dots with improved stability was granted to inventors lianhua qu and gregory miller the patent is directed to processes for synthesizing an alloy gradient nanoparticle with a zns shell and an outside coating of aluminum oxide that provides a barrier to environmental degradation in addition to providing improved photo thermal and environmental stability the quantum dots demonstrate longer lifetimes as the optically transparent aluminum oxide outer layer serves as a shield against degradation by humidity and oxygen the passivation technology is applicable to crystalplexs alloy gradient cadmiumfree quantum dots as well the protection provided by the sapphire ™ quantum dot shell makes passivated nanoparticles particularly well suited to the demanding requirements of optoelectronic applications said dr qu chief technical officer at crystalplex corp they have proven to be quite resilient in august dr qu presented his findings on the use of passivated quantum dots in a thermally processable matrix at the th international liquid crystal conference ilcc at kent state university in ohio see dr qus technical paper wwwcrystalplexcom and click on technological developments the granting of the passivation patent further strengthens our robust patent portfolio said crysta ip lex ceo matt boatman in addition these airstable quantum dots have been melt processed in polymer substrates to our knowledge no other manufacturers quantum dots can withstand such extreme heat see video of quantum dotpolymer composite being coextruded with pmma at over °c at

contact ken acer – director business development                                 kencrystalplexcom   patent granted by uspto for crystalplex corps sapphire™ quantum dots pittsburgh september  crystalplex corp today announced the us patent and trademark office uspto issued u s patent no  passivated nanoparticles assigned to crystalplex the patent which claims the fabrication and use of sapphire™ quantum dots or passivated quantum dots with improved stability was granted to inventors lianhua qu and gregory miller the patent is directed to processes for synthesizing an alloy gradient nanoparticle with a zns shell and an outside coating of aluminum oxide that provides a barrier to environmental degradation in addition to providing improved photo thermal and environmental stability the quantum dots demonstrate longer lifetimes as the optically transparent aluminum oxide outer layer serves as a shield against degradation by humidity and oxygen the passivation technology is applicable to crystalplexs alloy gradient cadmiumfree quantum dots as well the protection provided by the sapphire ™ quantum dot shell makes passivated nanoparticles particularly well suited to the demanding requirements of optoelectronic applications said dr qu chief technical officer at crystalplex corp they have proven to be quite resilient in august dr qu presented his findings on the use of passivated quantum dots in a thermally processable matrix at the th international liquid crystal conference ilcc at kent state university in ohio see dr qus technical paper wwwcrystalplexcom and click on technological developments the granting of the passivation patent further strengthens our robust patent portfolio said crysta ip lex ceo matt boatman in addition these airstable quantum dots have been melt processed in polymer substrates to our knowledge no other manufacturers quantum dots can withstand such extreme heat see video of quantum dotpolymer composite being coextruded with pmma at
