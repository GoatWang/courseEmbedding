the establishment of a federated form of government unique in north america the municipality of metropolitan toronto act was passed and a member council of metropolitan toronto met for the first time

since the joint credit of the combined municipalities was much greater than the sum of their credits as individual authorities financing was greatly simplified a common level of assessment and tax rate on property—the main source of revenue—was agreed upon by each municipality a most significant feature of the system was that members of the metropolitan council were appointed by virtue of their election to office either as mayors aldermen or controllers of a particular municipality thus ensuring a high degree of coordination and good communication between the central body and the local municipalitiesthe metropolitan council worked well it resolved many of the difficult sewage and water problems it greatly improved transportation by constructing expressways and roads a new airport

developmentin  the corporation of metropolitan toronto was reorganized the  municipalities were reduced to six and the council was increased to  members later legislation gave the boroughs the option to rename themselves cities the council considerably extended its responsibilities in education and the social services adding for example urban renewal waste disposal and ambulance and library services in  and  the council was again increased in size and it added to its jurisdiction such problems as the control of urban development and housing for the elderly in  the ontario legislature

northern plains and warm moist air from the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean the effects of these major air masses on temperature and precipitation depend mainly on latitude proximity to major

influence the climatic region of southern ontario during the fall and winter months heat stored from the lakes is released moderating the climate near the shores of the lakes this gives some parts of

köppen climate types of ontario summer at sandbanks provincial park on lake ontario the climate of ontario varies by season and location it is affected by three air sources cold dry arctic air from the north dominant factor during the winter months and for a longer part of the year in far northern ontario pacific polar air crossing in from the western canadian prairiesus northern plains and warm moist air from the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean the effects of these major air masses on temperature and precipitation depend mainly on latitude proximity to major bodies of water and to a small extent terrain relief in general most of ontarios climate is classified as humid continental ontario has three main climatic regions the surrounding great lakes greatly influence the climatic region of southern ontario during the fall and winter months heat stored from the lakes is released moderating the climate near the shores of the lakes this gives some parts of southern ontario milder winters than midcontinental areas at lower latitudes parts of southwestern ontario generally south of a line from sarniatoronto have a moderate humid continental climate köppen climate classification dfa similar to that of the inland midatlantic states and the great lakes portion of the midwestern united states the region has warm to hot humid summers and cold winters annual precipitation ranges from – mm – in and is well distributed throughout the year most of this region lies in the lee of the great lakes making for abundant snow in some areas in december  the snowbelt set a new record when it was hit by more than a metre of snow within  hours the next climatic region is central and eastern ontario which has a moderate humid continental climate köppen dfb this region has warm and sometimes hot summers with colder longer winters ample snowfall even in regions not directly in the snowbelts and annual precipitation similar to the rest of southern ontario the niagara escarpment on the bruce peninsula in the northeastern parts of ontario extending far as south as kirkland lake the cold waters of hudson bay depress summer temperatures making it cooler than other locations at similar latitudes the same is true on the northern shore of lake superior which cools hot humid air from the south leading to cooler summer temperatures along the eastern shores of lake superior and lake huron winter temperatures are slightly moderated but come with frequent heavy lakeeffect snow squalls that increase seasonal snowfall totals upwards of  m  ft in some places these regions have higher annual precipitation in some case over  cm  in the northernmost parts of ontario — primarily north of °n — have a subarctic climate köppen dfc with long severely cold winters and short cool to warm summers with dramatic temperature changes possible in all seasons with no major mountain ranges blocking sinking arctic air masses temperatures of − °c − °f are not uncommon snowfall remains on

establishment of algoma district and nipissing district in  the borders of ontario its new name in  were provisionally expanded north and west when the province of canada was formed its borders were not entirely clear and ontario claimed eventually to reach all the way to the rocky mountains and arctic ocean with canadas acquisition of ruperts land ontario was interested in clearly defining its borders especially since some of the new areas in which it was interested were rapidly growing after the federal government asked ontario to pay for construction in the new disputed area the province asked for an elaboration on its limits and its boundary was moved north to the st parallel north the northern and western boundaries of ontario were in dispute after canadian confederation ontarios right to northwestern ontario was determined by the judicial committee of the privy council in  and confirmed by the canada ontario boundary act  of the parliament of the united kingdom by  there were

explorer étienne brûlé explored part of the area in – the english explorer henry hudson sailed into hudson bay in  and claimed the area for england samuel de champlain reached lake huron in  and french missionaries began to establish posts along the great lakes french settlement was hampered by their hostilities with the iroquois who allied themselves with the british from  to  hurons were devastated by european infectious diseases such as measles and smallpox to which they had no immunity by  the iroquois had seceded from ontario and the mississaugas of the ojibwa had settled the north

canada american troops in the war of  invaded upper canada across the niagara river and the detroit river but were defeated and pushed back by the british canadian fencibles and militias and first nations warriors however eventually the americans gained control of lake erie and lake ontario during the battle of york in  american troops occupied the town of york the americans looted the town and burned the parliament buildings during the brief occupation after the war of  relative stability allowed for increasing numbers of immigrants to arrive from europe rather than from the united states as was the case in the previous decades this immigration shift was encouraged by the colonial leaders despite affordable and often free land many arriving newcomers mostly from britain and ireland found frontier life with the harsh climate difficult and some of those with the means eventually returned home or went south however population growth far exceeded emigration in the decades that followed it was a mostly agrarianbased society but canal projects and a new network of plank roads spurred greater trade within the colony and with the united states thereby improving previously damaged relations over time lower ontario in  guillaume de lisle map approximate province area highlighted meanwhile ontarios numerous waterways aided travel and transportation into the interior and supplied water power for development as the population increased so did the industries and transportation networks which in turn led to further development by the end of the century ontario vied with quebec as the nations leader in terms of growth in population industry arts and communications unrest in the colony began to chafe against the aristocratic family compact who governed while benefiting economically from the regions resources and who did not allow elected bodies power this resentment spurred republican ideals and sowed the seeds for early canadian nationalism accordingly rebellion in favour of responsible government rose in both regions louisjoseph papineau led the lower canada rebellion and william lyon mackenzie led the upper canada rebellion canada westedit main article province of canada although both rebellions were put down in short order the british government sent lord durham to investigate the causes of the unrest he recommended that selfgovernment be granted and that lower and upper canada be rejoined in an attempt to assimilate the french canadians accordingly the two colonies were merged into the province of canada by the act of union  with the capital at kingston and upper canada becoming known as canada west parliamentary selfgovernment was granted in  there were heavy waves of immigration in the s and the population of canada west more than doubled by  over the previous decade as a result for the first time the englishspeaking population of canada west surpassed the frenchspeaking population of canada east tilting the representative balance of power an economic boom in the s coincided with railway expansion across the province further increasing the economic strength of central canada with the repeal of the corn laws and a reciprocity agreement in place with united states various industries such as timber mining farming and alcohol distilling benefited tremendously a political stalemate between the french and englishspeaking legislators as well as fear of aggression from the united states during and immediately after the american civil war led the political elite to hold a series of conferences in the s to effect a broader federal union of all british north american colonies the british north america act took effect on july   establishing the dominion of canada initially with four provinces nova scotia new brunswick quebec and ontario the province of canada was divided into ontario and quebec so that each linguistic group would have its own province both quebec and ontario were required by section  of the british north america act to safeguard existing educational rights and privileges of protestant and the catholic minority thus separate catholic schools and school boards were permitted in ontario however neither province had a constitutional requirement to protect its french or englishspeaking minority toronto was formally established as ontarios provincial capital provincehoodedit downtown london at night celebrating ve day in ottawa in  toronto the capital of ontario once constituted as a province ontario proceeded to assert its economic and legislative power in  the lawyer oliver mowat became premier of ontario and remained as premier until  he fought for provincial rights weakening the power of the federal government in provincial matters usually through wellargued appeals to the judicial committee of the privy council his battles with the federal government greatly decentralized canada giving the provinces far more power than john a macdonald had intended he consolidated and expanded ontarios educational and provincial institutions created districts in northern ontario and fought to ensure that those parts of northwestern ontario not historically part of upper canada the vast areas north and west of the lake superiorhudson bay watershed known as the district of keewatin would become part of ontario a victory embodied in the canada ontario boundary act  he also presided over the emergence of the province into the economic powerhouse of canada mowat was the creator of what is often called empire ontario beginning with sir john a macdonalds national policy  and the construction of the canadian pacific railway – through northern ontario and the canadian prairies to british columbia ontario manufacturing and industry flourished however population increase slowed after a large recession hit the province in  thus slowing growth drastically but for only a few years many newly arrived immigrants and others moved west along the railway to the prairie provinces and british columbia sparsely settling northern ontario mineral exploitation accelerated in the late th century leading to the rise of important mining centres in the northeast such as sudbury cobalt and timmins the province harnessed its water power to generate hydroelectric power and created the statecontrolled hydroelectric power commission of ontario later ontario hydro the availability of cheap electric power further facilitated the development of industry the ford motor company of canada was established in  general motors canada was formed in  the motor vehicle industry became the most lucrative industry for the ontario economy during the th century in july  the conservative government of sir james whitney issued regulation  which severely limited the availability of frenchlanguage schooling to the provinces frenchspeaking minority french canadians reacted with outrage journalist henri bourassa denouncing the prussians of ontario the regulation was eventually repealed in  influenced by events in the united states the government of sir william hearst introduced prohibition of alcoholic drinks in  with the passing of the ontario temperance act however residents could distill and retain their own personal supply and liquor producers could continue distillation and export for sale allowing this already sizeable industry to strengthen further ontario became a hotbed for the illegal smuggling of liquor and the biggest supplier into the united states which was under complete prohibition prohibition in ontario came to an end in  with the establishment of the liquor control board of ontario under the government of howard ferguson the sale and consumption of liquor wine and beer are still controlled by some of the most extreme laws in north america to ensure that strict community standards and revenue generation from the alcohol retail monopoly are upheld in april  ontario member of provincial parliament kim craitor suggested that local brewers should be able to sell their beer in local corner stores however the motion was quickly rejected by premier dalton mcguinty the postworld war ii period was one of exceptional prosperity and growth ontario has been the recipients of most immigration to canada largely immigrants from wartorn europe in the s and s and following changes in federal immigration law a massive influx of noneuropeans since the s from a largely ethnically british province ontario has rapidly become culturally very diverse the nationalist movement in quebec particularly after the election of the parti québécois in  contributed to driving many businesses and englishspeaking people out of quebec to ontario and as a result toronto surpassed montreal as the largest city and economic centre of

köppen climate types of ontario summer at sandbanks provincial park on lake ontario the climate of ontario varies by season and location it is affected by three air sources cold dry arctic air from the north dominant factor during the winter months and for a longer part of the year in far northern ontario pacific polar air crossing in from the western canadian prairiesus northern plains and warm moist air from the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean the effects of these major air masses on temperature and precipitation depend mainly on latitude proximity to major bodies of water and to a small extent terrain relief in general most of ontarios climate is classified as humid continental ontario has three main climatic regions the surrounding great lakes greatly influence the climatic region of southern ontario during the fall and winter months heat stored from the lakes is released moderating the climate near the shores of the lakes this gives some parts of southern ontario milder winters than midcontinental areas at lower latitudes parts of southwestern ontario generally south of a line from sarniatoronto have a moderate humid continental climate köppen climate classification dfa similar to that of the inland midatlantic states and the great lakes portion of the midwestern united states the region has warm to hot humid summers and cold winters annual precipitation ranges from – mm – in and is well distributed throughout the year most of this region lies in the lee of the great lakes making for abundant snow in some areas in december  the snowbelt set a new record when it was hit by more than a metre of snow within  hours the next climatic region is central and eastern ontario which has a moderate humid continental climate köppen dfb this region has warm and sometimes hot summers with colder longer winters ample snowfall even in regions not directly in the snowbelts and annual precipitation similar to the rest of southern ontario the niagara escarpment on the bruce peninsula in the northeastern parts of ontario extending far as south as kirkland lake the cold waters of hudson bay depress summer temperatures making it cooler than other locations at similar latitudes the same is true on the northern shore of lake superior which cools hot humid air from the south leading to cooler summer temperatures along the eastern shores of lake superior and lake huron winter temperatures are slightly moderated but come with frequent heavy lakeeffect snow squalls that increase seasonal snowfall totals upwards of  m  ft in some places these regions have higher annual precipitation in some case over  cm  in the northernmost parts of ontario — primarily north of °n — have a subarctic climate köppen dfc with long severely cold winters and short cool to

not entirely clear and ontario claimed eventually to reach all the way to the rocky mountains and arctic ocean with canadas acquisition of ruperts land ontario was interested in clearly defining its borders especially since some of the new areas in which it was interested were rapidly growing after the federal government asked ontario to pay for construction in the new disputed area the province asked for an elaboration on its limits and its boundary was moved north to the st parallel north the northern and western boundaries of ontario were in dispute after canadian confederation ontarios

nations warriors however eventually the americans gained control of lake erie and lake ontario during the battle of york in  american troops occupied the town of york the americans looted the town and burned the parliament buildings during the brief occupation after the war of  relative stability allowed for increasing numbers of immigrants to arrive from europe rather than from the united states as was the case in the previous decades this immigration shift was encouraged by the colonial leaders despite affordable and often free land many arriving newcomers mostly from britain and ireland found frontier life with the harsh climate difficult and some of those with the means eventually returned home or went south however population growth far exceeded emigration in the decades that followed it was a mostly agrarianbased society but canal projects and a new network of plank roads spurred greater trade within the colony and with the united states thereby improving previously damaged relations over time lower ontario in  guillaume de lisle map approximate province area highlighted meanwhile ontarios numerous waterways aided travel and transportation into the interior and

quebec as the nations leader in terms of growth in population industry arts and communications unrest in the colony began to chafe against the aristocratic family compact who governed while benefiting economically from the regions resources and who did not allow elected bodies power this resentment spurred republican ideals and sowed the seeds for early canadian nationalism accordingly rebellion in favour of responsible government rose in both regions louisjoseph papineau led the lower canada rebellion and william lyon mackenzie led the upper canada rebellion canada westedit main article province of canada although both rebellions were put down in short order the british government sent lord durham to investigate the causes of the unrest he recommended that selfgovernment be granted and that lower and upper canada be rejoined in an attempt to assimilate the french canadians accordingly the two colonies were merged into the province of canada by the act of union  with the capital at kingston and upper canada becoming known as canada west parliamentary selfgovernment was granted in  there were heavy waves of immigration in the s and the population of canada west more than doubled by  over the previous decade as a result for the first time the englishspeaking population of canada west surpassed the frenchspeaking population of canada east tilting the representative balance of power an economic boom in the s coincided with railway expansion across the province further increasing the economic strength of central canada with the repeal of the corn laws and a reciprocity agreement in place with united states various industries such as timber mining farming and alcohol distilling benefited tremendously a political stalemate between the french and englishspeaking legislators as well as fear of aggression from the united states during and immediately after the american civil war led the political elite to hold a series of conferences in the s to effect a broader federal union of all british north american colonies the british north america act took effect on july   establishing the dominion of canada initially with four provinces nova scotia new brunswick quebec and ontario the province of canada was divided into ontario and quebec so that each linguistic group would have its own province both quebec and ontario were required by section  of the british north america act to safeguard existing educational rights and privileges of protestant and the catholic minority thus separate catholic schools and school boards were permitted in ontario however neither province had a constitutional requirement to protect its french or englishspeaking minority toronto was formally established as ontarios provincial capital provincehoodedit downtown london at night celebrating ve day in ottawa in  toronto the capital of ontario once constituted as a province ontario proceeded to assert its economic and legislative power in  the lawyer oliver mowat became premier of ontario and remained as premier until  he fought for provincial rights weakening the power of the federal government in provincial matters usually through wellargued appeals to the judicial committee of the privy council his battles with the federal government greatly decentralized canada giving the provinces far more power than john a macdonald had intended he consolidated and expanded ontarios educational and provincial institutions created districts in northern ontario and fought to ensure that those parts of northwestern ontario not historically part of upper canada the vast areas north and west of the lake superiorhudson bay watershed known as the district of keewatin would become part of ontario a victory embodied in the canada ontario boundary act  he also presided over the emergence of the province into the economic powerhouse of canada mowat was the creator of what is often called empire ontario beginning with sir john a macdonalds national policy  and the construction of the canadian pacific railway – through northern ontario and the canadian prairies to british columbia ontario manufacturing and industry flourished however population increase slowed after a large recession hit the province in  thus slowing growth drastically but for only a few years many newly arrived immigrants and others moved west along the railway to the prairie provinces and british columbia sparsely settling northern ontario mineral exploitation accelerated in the late th century leading to the rise of important mining centres in the northeast such as sudbury cobalt and timmins the province harnessed its water power to generate hydroelectric power and created the statecontrolled hydroelectric power commission of ontario later ontario hydro the availability of cheap electric power further facilitated the development of industry the ford motor company of canada was established in  general motors canada was formed in  the motor vehicle industry became the most lucrative industry for the ontario economy during the th century in july  the conservative government of sir james whitney issued regulation  which severely limited the availability of frenchlanguage schooling to the provinces frenchspeaking minority french canadians reacted with outrage journalist henri bourassa denouncing the prussians of ontario the regulation was eventually repealed in  influenced by events in the united states the government of sir william hearst introduced prohibition of alcoholic drinks in  with the passing of the ontario temperance act however residents could distill and retain their own personal supply and liquor producers could continue distillation and export for sale allowing this already sizeable industry to strengthen further ontario became a hotbed for the illegal smuggling of liquor and the biggest supplier into the united states which was under complete prohibition prohibition in ontario came to an end in  with the establishment of the liquor control board of ontario under the government of howard ferguson the sale and consumption of liquor wine and beer are still controlled by some of the most extreme laws in north america to ensure that strict community standards and revenue generation from the alcohol retail monopoly are upheld in april  ontario member of provincial parliament kim craitor suggested that local brewers should be able to sell their beer in local corner stores however the motion was quickly rejected by premier dalton mcguinty the postworld war ii period was one of exceptional prosperity and growth ontario has been the recipients of most immigration to canada largely immigrants from wartorn europe in the s and s and following changes in federal immigration law a massive influx of noneuropeans since the s from a largely ethnically british province ontario has rapidly become culturally very diverse the nationalist movement in quebec particularly after the election of the parti québécois in  contributed to driving many businesses and englishspeaking people out of quebec to ontario and as a result toronto surpassed montreal as the largest city and economic centre of

köppen climate types of ontario summer at sandbanks provincial park on lake ontario the climate of ontario varies by season and location it is affected by three air sources cold dry arctic air from the north dominant factor during the winter months and for a longer part of the year in far northern ontario pacific polar air crossing in from the western canadian prairiesus northern plains and warm moist air from the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean the effects of these major air masses on temperature and precipitation depend mainly on latitude proximity to major bodies of water and to a small extent terrain relief in general most of ontarios climate is classified as humid continental ontario has three main climatic regions the surrounding great lakes greatly influence the climatic region of southern ontario during the fall and winter months heat stored from the lakes is released moderating the climate near the shores of the lakes this gives some parts of southern ontario milder winters than midcontinental areas at lower latitudes parts of southwestern ontario generally south of a line from sarniatoronto have a moderate humid continental climate köppen climate classification

sometimes hot summers with colder longer winters ample snowfall even in regions not directly in the snowbelts and annual precipitation similar to the rest of southern ontario the niagara escarpment on the bruce peninsula in the northeastern parts of ontario extending far as south as kirkland lake the cold waters of hudson bay depress summer temperatures making it cooler than other locations at similar latitudes the same is true on the northern shore of lake superior which cools hot humid air from the south leading to cooler summer temperatures along the eastern shores of lake superior and lake huron winter temperatures are slightly moderated but come with frequent heavy lakeeffect snow squalls that increase seasonal snowfall totals upwards of  m  ft in some places these regions have

burned the parliament buildings during the brief occupation after the war of  relative stability allowed for increasing numbers of immigrants to arrive from europe rather than from the united states as was the case in the previous decades this immigration shift was encouraged by the colonial leaders despite affordable and often free land many arriving newcomers mostly from britain and ireland found frontier life with the harsh climate difficult and some of those with the means eventually returned home or went south however population growth far exceeded emigration in the decades that

reciprocity agreement in place with united states various industries such as timber mining farming and alcohol distilling benefited tremendously a political stalemate between the french and englishspeaking legislators as well as fear of aggression from the united states during and immediately after the american civil war led the political elite to hold a series of conferences in the s to

the north dominant factor during the winter months and for a longer part of the year in far northern ontario pacific polar air crossing in from the western canadian prairiesus northern plains and warm moist air from the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean the effects of these major air masses on temperature and precipitation depend mainly on latitude proximity to major bodies of water and to a small extent terrain relief in general most of ontarios climate is classified as humid continental ontario has three main climatic regions the surrounding great lakes greatly influence the climatic region of southern ontario during the fall and winter months heat stored from the lakes is released moderating the climate near the shores of the lakes this gives some parts of southern ontario milder winters than midcontinental areas at lower latitudes parts of southwestern ontario generally south of a line from sarniatoronto have a moderate humid continental climate köppen climate classification

sometimes hot summers with colder longer winters ample snowfall even in regions not directly in the snowbelts and annual precipitation similar to the rest of southern ontario the niagara escarpment on the bruce peninsula in the northeastern parts of ontario extending far as south as kirkland lake the cold waters of hudson bay depress summer temperatures making it cooler than other locations at similar latitudes the same is true on the northern shore of lake superior which cools hot humid air from the south leading to cooler summer temperatures along the eastern shores of lake superior and

as was the case in the previous decades this immigration shift was encouraged by the colonial leaders despite affordable and often free land many arriving newcomers mostly from britain and ireland found frontier life with the harsh climate difficult and some of those with the means eventually returned home or went south however population growth far exceeded emigration in the decades that

referred to as western ontario despite the absence of any mountainous terrain in the province there are large areas of uplands particularly within the canadian shield which traverses the province from northwest to southeast and also above the niagara escarpment which crosses the south the highest point is ishpatina ridge at  metres  ft above sea level located in temagami northeastern ontario in the south elevations of over  m  ft are surpassed near collingwood above the blue mountains in the dundalk highlands and in hilltops near the madawaska river in renfrew county the carolinian forest zone

köppen climate types of ontario summer at sandbanks provincial park on lake ontario the climate of ontario varies by season and location it is affected by three air sources cold dry arctic air from the north dominant factor during the winter months and for a longer part of the year in far northern ontario pacific polar air crossing in from the western canadian prairiesus northern plains and warm moist air from the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean the effects of these major air masses on temperature and precipitation depend mainly on latitude proximity to major bodies of water and to a small extent terrain relief in general most of ontarios climate is classified as humid continental ontario has three main climatic regions the surrounding great lakes greatly influence the climatic region of southern ontario during the fall and winter months heat stored from the lakes is released moderating the climate near the shores of the lakes this gives some parts of southern ontario milder winters than midcontinental areas at lower latitudes parts of southwestern ontario generally south of a line from sarniatoronto have a moderate humid continental climate köppen climate classification dfa similar to that of the inland midatlantic states and the great lakes portion of the midwestern united states the region has warm to hot humid summers and cold winters annual precipitation ranges from – mm – in and is well distributed throughout the year most of this region lies in the lee of the great lakes making for abundant snow in some areas in december  the snowbelt set a new record when it was hit by more than a metre of snow within  hours the next climatic region is central and eastern ontario which has a moderate humid continental climate köppen dfb this region has warm and sometimes hot summers with colder longer winters ample snowfall even in regions not directly in the snowbelts and annual precipitation similar to the rest of southern ontario the niagara escarpment on the bruce peninsula in the northeastern parts of ontario extending far as south as kirkland lake the cold waters of hudson bay depress summer temperatures making it cooler than other locations at similar latitudes the same is true on the northern shore of lake superior which cools hot humid air from the south leading to cooler summer temperatures along the eastern shores of lake superior and lake huron winter temperatures are slightly moderated but come with frequent heavy lakeeffect snow squalls that increase seasonal snowfall totals upwards of  m  ft in some places these regions have higher annual precipitation in some case over  cm  in the northernmost parts of ontario — primarily north of °n — have a subarctic climate köppen dfc with long severely cold winters and short cool to warm summers with dramatic temperature changes possible in all seasons with no major mountain ranges blocking sinking arctic air masses temperatures of − °c − °f are not uncommon snowfall remains on

rate on property—the main source of revenue—was agreed upon by each municipality a most significant feature of the system was that members of the metropolitan council were appointed by virtue of their election to office either as mayors aldermen or controllers of a particular municipality thus ensuring a high degree of coordination and good communication between the central body and the local municipalitiesthe metropolitan council worked well it resolved many of the difficult sewage and water problems it greatly improved transportation by constructing expressways and roads a new airport

to rename themselves cities the council considerably extended its responsibilities in education and the social services adding for example urban renewal waste disposal and ambulance and library

factor during the winter months and for a longer part of the year in far northern ontario pacific polar air crossing in from the western canadian prairiesus northern plains and warm moist air from the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean the effects of these major air masses on temperature and precipitation depend mainly on latitude proximity to major bodies of water and to a small extent terrain relief in general most of ontarios climate is classified as humid continental ontario has three main climatic regions the surrounding great lakes greatly influence the climatic region of southern ontario during the fall and winter months heat stored from the lakes is released moderating the climate near the shores of the lakes this gives some parts of southern ontario milder winters than

summers with colder longer winters ample snowfall even in regions not directly in the snowbelts and annual precipitation similar to the rest of southern ontario the niagara escarpment on the bruce peninsula in the northeastern parts of ontario extending far as south as kirkland lake the cold waters of hudson bay depress summer temperatures making it cooler than other locations at similar latitudes the same is true on the northern shore of lake superior which cools hot humid air from the south leading to cooler summer temperatures along the eastern shores of lake superior and lake

burned the parliament buildings during the brief occupation after the war of  relative stability allowed for increasing numbers of immigrants to arrive from europe rather than from the united states as was the case in the previous decades this immigration shift was encouraged by the colonial leaders despite affordable and often free land many arriving newcomers mostly from britain and ireland found frontier life with the harsh climate difficult and some of those with the means eventually returned home or went south however population growth far exceeded emigration in the decades that

reciprocity agreement in place with united states various industries such as timber mining farming and alcohol distilling benefited tremendously a political stalemate between the french and englishspeaking legislators as well as fear of aggression from the united states during and immediately after the american civil war led the political elite to hold a series of conferences in the s to

the north dominant factor during the winter months and for a longer part of the year in far northern ontario pacific polar air crossing in from the western canadian prairiesus northern plains and warm moist air from the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean the effects of these major air masses on temperature and precipitation depend mainly on latitude proximity to major bodies of water and to a small extent terrain relief in general most of ontarios climate is classified as humid continental ontario has three main climatic regions the surrounding great lakes greatly influence the climatic region of southern ontario during the fall and winter months heat stored from the lakes is released moderating the climate near the shores of the lakes this gives some parts of southern ontario milder

the bruce peninsula in the northeastern parts of ontario extending far as south as kirkland lake the cold waters of hudson bay depress summer temperatures making it cooler than other locations at similar latitudes the same is true on the northern shore of lake superior which cools hot humid air from the south leading to cooler summer temperatures along the eastern shores of lake superior and

as was the case in the previous decades this immigration shift was encouraged by the colonial leaders despite affordable and often free land many arriving newcomers mostly from britain and ireland found frontier life with the harsh climate difficult and some of those with the means eventually returned home or went south however population growth far exceeded emigration in the decades that

canadian shield in the northwestern and central portions which comprises over half the land area of ontario although this area mostly does not support agriculture it is rich in minerals and in part covered by the central and midwestern canadian shield forests studded with lakes and rivers northern ontario is subdivided into two subregions northwestern ontario and northeastern ontario the virtually unpopulated hudson bay lowlands in the extreme north and northeast mainly swampy and sparsely forested southern ontario which is further subdivided into four regions central ontario although not actually the provinces geographic centre eastern ontario golden horseshoe and southwestern ontario parts of which were formerly referred to as western ontario despite the absence of any mountainous terrain in the province there are large areas of uplands particularly within the canadian shield which traverses the province from northwest to southeast and also above the niagara escarpment which crosses the south the highest point is ishpatina ridge at  metres  ft above sea level located in temagami northeastern ontario in the south elevations of over  m  ft are surpassed near collingwood above the blue mountains in the dundalk highlands and in hilltops near the madawaska river in renfrew county the carolinian forest zone covers most of the southwestern region of the province the temperate and fertile great lakessaint lawrence valley in the south is part of the eastern great lakes lowland forests ecoregion where the forest has now been largely replaced by agriculture industrial and urban development a wellknown geographic feature is niagara falls part of the niagara escarpment the saint lawrence seaway allows navigation to and from the atlantic ocean

slightly farther all are south of °n – slightly farther south than the northern border of california climateedit see also geography of ontario § climate köppen climate types of ontario summer at sandbanks provincial park on lake ontario the climate of ontario varies by season and location it is affected by three air sources cold dry arctic air from the north dominant factor during the winter months and for a longer part of the year in far northern ontario pacific polar air crossing in from the western canadian prairiesus northern plains and warm moist air from the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean the effects of these major air masses on temperature and precipitation depend mainly on latitude proximity to major bodies of water and to a small extent terrain relief in general most of ontarios climate is classified as humid continental ontario has three main climatic regions the surrounding great lakes greatly influence the climatic region of southern ontario during the fall and winter months heat stored from the lakes is released moderating the climate near the shores of the lakes this gives some parts of southern ontario milder winters than midcontinental areas at lower latitudes parts of southwestern ontario generally south of a line from sarniatoronto have a moderate humid continental climate köppen climate classification dfa similar to that of the inland midatlantic states and the great lakes portion of the midwestern united states the region has warm to hot humid summers and cold winters annual precipitation ranges from – mm – in and is well distributed throughout the year most of this region lies in the lee of the great lakes making for abundant snow in some areas in december  the snowbelt set a new record when it was hit by more than a metre of snow within  hours the next climatic region is central and eastern ontario which has a moderate humid continental climate köppen dfb this region has warm and sometimes hot summers with colder longer winters ample snowfall even in regions not directly in the snowbelts and annual precipitation similar to the rest of southern ontario the niagara escarpment on the bruce peninsula in the northeastern parts of ontario extending far as south as kirkland lake the cold waters of hudson bay depress summer temperatures making it cooler than other locations at similar latitudes the same is true on the northern shore of lake superior which cools hot humid air from the south leading to cooler summer temperatures along the eastern shores of lake superior and lake huron winter temperatures are slightly moderated but come with frequent heavy lakeeffect snow squalls that increase seasonal snowfall totals upwards of  m  ft in some places these regions have higher annual precipitation in some case over  cm  in the northernmost parts of ontario — primarily north of °n — have a subarctic climate köppen dfc with long severely cold winters and short cool to warm summers with dramatic temperature changes possible in all seasons with no major mountain ranges blocking sinking arctic air masses temperatures of − °c − °f are not uncommon snowfall remains on the ground for sometimes

referred to as western ontario despite the absence of any mountainous terrain in the province there are large areas of uplands particularly within the canadian shield which traverses the province from northwest to southeast and also above the niagara escarpment which crosses the south the highest point is ishpatina ridge at  metres  ft above sea level located in temagami northeastern ontario in the south elevations of over  m  ft are surpassed near collingwood above the blue mountains in the dundalk highlands and in hilltops near the madawaska river in renfrew county the carolinian forest zone

köppen climate types of ontario summer at sandbanks provincial park on lake ontario the climate of ontario varies by season and location it is affected by three air sources cold dry arctic air from the north dominant factor during the winter months and for a longer part of the year in far northern ontario pacific polar air crossing in from the western canadian prairiesus northern plains and warm moist air from the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean the effects of these major air masses on temperature and precipitation depend mainly on latitude proximity to major bodies of water and to a small extent terrain relief in general most of ontarios climate is classified as humid continental ontario has three main climatic regions the surrounding great lakes greatly influence the climatic region of southern ontario during the fall and winter months heat stored from the lakes is released moderating the climate near the shores of the lakes this gives some parts of southern ontario milder winters than midcontinental areas at lower latitudes parts of southwestern ontario generally south of a line from sarniatoronto have a moderate humid continental climate köppen climate classification dfa similar to that of the inland midatlantic states and the great lakes portion of the midwestern united states the region has warm to hot humid summers and cold winters annual precipitation ranges from – mm – in and is well distributed throughout the year most of this region lies in the lee of the great lakes making for abundant snow in some areas in december  the snowbelt set a new record when it was hit by more than a metre of snow within  hours the next climatic region is central and eastern ontario which has a moderate humid continental climate köppen dfb this region has warm and sometimes hot summers with colder longer winters ample snowfall even in regions not directly in the snowbelts and annual precipitation similar to the rest of southern ontario the niagara escarpment on the bruce peninsula in the northeastern parts of ontario extending far as south as kirkland lake the cold waters of hudson bay depress summer temperatures making it cooler than other locations at similar latitudes the same is true on the northern shore of lake superior which cools hot humid air from the south leading to cooler summer temperatures along the eastern shores of lake superior and lake huron winter temperatures are slightly moderated but come with frequent heavy lakeeffect snow squalls that increase seasonal snowfall totals upwards of  m  ft in some places these regions have higher annual precipitation in some case over  cm  in the northernmost parts of ontario — primarily north of °n — have a subarctic climate köppen dfc with long severely cold winters and short cool to warm summers with dramatic temperature changes possible in all seasons with no major mountain ranges blocking sinking arctic air masses temperatures of − °c − °f are not uncommon snowfall remains on

not entirely clear and ontario claimed eventually to reach all the way to the rocky mountains and arctic ocean with canadas acquisition of ruperts land ontario was interested in clearly defining its borders especially since some of the new areas in which it was interested were rapidly growing after the federal government asked ontario to pay for construction in the new disputed area the province asked for an elaboration on its limits and its boundary was moved north to the st parallel north the northern and western boundaries of ontario were in dispute after canadian confederation ontarios

nations warriors however eventually the americans gained control of lake erie and lake ontario during the battle of york in  american troops occupied the town of york the americans looted the town and burned the parliament buildings during the brief occupation after the war of  relative stability allowed for increasing numbers of immigrants to arrive from europe rather than from the united states as was the case in the previous decades this immigration shift was encouraged by the colonial leaders despite affordable and often free land many arriving newcomers mostly from britain and ireland found frontier life with the harsh climate difficult and some of those with the means eventually returned home or went south however population growth far exceeded emigration in the decades that followed it was a mostly agrarianbased society but canal projects and a new network of plank roads spurred greater trade within the colony and with the united states thereby improving previously

parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
