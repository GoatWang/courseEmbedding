company briefin recent years hawaiian airlines inc wwwhawaiianairlinescom has been the nation’s highestranked carrier for service quality and performance in the annual airline quality rating study hawaiian has also led all us carriers in ontime performance for each of the past seven years as reported by the us department of transportation in its nd year of continuous service in hawaii hawaiian is the largest provider of passenger air service to hawaii from the state’s primary visitor markets on the us mainland a subsidiary of hawaiian holdings inc hawaiian offers nonstop service to hawaii from more us gateway cities than any other airline as well as service to south korea japan the philippines australia american samoa and tahiti hawaiian also provides approximately  daily jet flights between the hawaiian islands when you joined hawaiian airlines at a time of turbulence in the market what made you feel this was the right fit for you first as a tourist destination hawaii is without peer in the world i had every reason to believe that would continue and i have that same level of confidence going forward second i knew there was room in the airline space for an airline that focused on a destination if that destination was strong enough third when i looked at the competitive landscape in and out of hawaii it was apparent that notwithstanding the fact that hawaiian’s results had been poor all of the basic ingredients of success were there hawaiin airline a how challenging was it when you came onboard to create a vision that people could rally around that is always the big challenge particularly when you go into a situation where a company has been around for a long time and has not been doing well for a long time the sense of it being preordained that things won’t go well becomes deeprooted in the organization there wasn’t a single moment where we suddenly moved from one side of the aisle to the other but when i arrived we looked for something we could change that wasn’t big and largely strategic but which was relatively shortterm and extremely emblematic to build confidence to demonstrate as a matter of internal messaging that we don’t have to be second to anybody the thing we chose was punctuality at that time the airline’s threeletter designator hal had become colloquially known as standing for “hawaiian’s always late” we said we’re going to slay this dragon and we’re not going to be average – we’re going to be the industry leader curiously and purely as a byproduct it has become an important part of our external messaging since then haneda high tea within asia where are you most focused and how broad are the opportunities there there are two types of markets for hawaii and asia there is japan which is a very large and mature market and there is everywhere else that means developing markets where the amount of traffic isn’t very high at the moment but where all the macroindicators suggest that over the long term these markets are going to be significant today in northeast asia we serve japan and korea korea has ridden out the recession perhaps better than any other country in the world and we have high hopes for them will china be a focus we hope so there is a great deal of opportunity in china the biggest impediment we have today when it comes to china is the difficulty that chinese nationals have in securing tourist visas to visit the us many passengers today complain about the food product especially for us carriers how critical is that to the experience first it is an important part of the hawaiian host culture to provide food it is a signal of welcoming and part of everyday life in hawaii but beyond that it is important because it transmits a sense of value to customers most of our competitors spend a lot of time focused on business travel and they pay varying degrees of lip service to people traveling on vacation our stock in trade is people traveling on vacation the people in economy are traveling with their families engaged in what is probably the second largest household expenditure of their entire year after their mortgage to send a signal that you are not sufficiently valuable to us as a customer to warrant basic sustenance is a powerful negative message conversely providing food says we value your business and we know the personal sacrifices that you’ve made to be here over the past  months when you have had strong results compared to the industry has the strength of hawaii as a destination been the key factor as a business we try all kinds of things to diversify our risk we’re flying to asia and we have a lot of business coming from the us mainland to hawaii but at the end of the day how hawaii does so does hawaiian airlines in this difficult economy one of the surprising things was the resilience of hawaii as a destination we had a much lower reduction in demand than almost any other destination anywhere in the world which speaks to the strength of hawaii as a
