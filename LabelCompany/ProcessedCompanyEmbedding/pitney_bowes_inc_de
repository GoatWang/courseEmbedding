significantly different from the brand name products decision pitney bowes inc of stamford connecticut protests the federal bureau of investigation’s fbi award of two contracts to neopost usa inc of milford connecticut under solicitation no djfpr no  and solicitation no djfpr no  for mail tracking systems  pitney bowes asserts that the agency failed to properly evaluate neopost’s quotations  we deny the protest background on september   the fbi posted two similar solicitations as commercial item acquisitions on the fedbid website  the solicitations restricted competition to vendors holding contracts under the general service administration’s gsa federal supply schedule fss  the solicitations sought to procure on a brand name or equal basis mail tracking systems including items such as hand‑held portable scanners or “tracking assistants” computer workstations software licenses and servers  the solicitations identified pitney bowes’ products from its fss contract as the brand name items to be procured more specifically solicitation no  sought a mail tracking system for the fbi’s quantico virginia location  the solicitation listed  contract line item numbers clin with pitney bowes’ model numbers and descriptions  solicitation no  at   as examples clin  specified “model tc portable tracking assistant” clin  identified “model emou sendsuite server hardware” and clin  specified “onsite warranty maitenance for base year”  id  the solicitation contained no further description of the items and indicated that the “target price” for all items was   id at  solicitation no  sought mail tracking systems for the fbi’s washington dc headquarters and cheverly maryland locations  the solicitation consisted of  clinsthe same items as solicitation no  along with additional items such as clin  “model tff imaging software” and clin  “annual maintenance for headquarters base year”  solicitation no  at   the solicitation also contained no further description of the items and provided a “target price” of   id at  of relevance here the solicitations included the federal acquisition regulation far brand name or equal clause  which informs offerors that to be considered for award proposals for equal products have to include sufficient information to show that the offered items meet the salient characteristics listed in the solicitation  see solicitation no  at  solicitation no  at   in addition the solicitations stated brand name or equal  the buyer is allowing sellers to submit bids for alternate items provided those items meet all of the salient physical functional or performance characteristics specified by this solicitation  sellers must enter exactly what they are bidding including make model and description into the blank description field in order for the bid to be considered  the buyer will evaluate ‘equal’ items on the basis of information furnished by the seller or identified in the bid and reasonably available to the buyer  the buyer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the bid  solicitation no  at  solicitation no  at   neither solicitation however contained or made reference to any salient characteristics of the identified pitney bowes brand name products on september   both pitney bowes and neopost submitted quotations for the solicitations with pitney bowes offering the brand name products and neopost offering equal products  after evaluating the quotations the fbi awarded both contracts to neopost  pitney bowes timely protested the awards asserting that the awards were improper because neopost did not have certain requirements relating to maintenance on its fss contract and because neopost’s fss contract did not include items that matched salient characteristics of several of pitney bowes’ products  for example pitney bowes alleged that its tc portable tracking assistant had features that were not found on neopost’s portable tracking assistant  in response the fbi stated that it would take corrective action by re‑evaluating the quotations and making a new award decision  thereafter our office dismissed pitney bowes’ protests  pitney bowes inc b b oct   unpublished decision in the course of implementing its corrective action the agency conducted discussions with the two vendors  legal memorandum at   during discussions pitney bowes was informed that its quotation contained no significant weaknesses or deficiencies while neopost was informed that its quotation contained one deficiency  specifically neopost was informed that the item it had proposed for a server lacked the capacity to store several years of package tracking data and that “to be considered ‘equal’ to the government’s requirement proposed servers had to be capable of storing a minimum of two years’ worth of data”  contracting officer’s co statement at  agency report ar tab  discussions letter at   in response neopost revised its quotation to include at no additional cost to the fbi an additional hard drive capable of retaining the data  co statement at ‑  the fbi gave both vendors a new deadline of december  to submit final quotation revisions  after receiving final quotations the agency sought clarifications from neopost regarding whether all items it had quoted were included on its gsa fss contract  co statement at   neopost responded by submitting pages from its fss contract that identified neopost’s proposed products’ model numbers and included product descriptions  ar tab  neopost dec   reply at   on these excerpts from its fss contract neopost included handwritten notes identifying the solicitations’ clins that corresponded to the items being offered in its quotation  for example with regard to solicitation no  neopost wrote “” next to the entry in its fss contract for model no idsnckn description “wtsp mc delivery scanner  includes scanner requires idsmbslic – mobile software license”  id at   neopost also wrote “” next to model no idsmbslicn description “wtsp mobile software license”  id at  the agency concluded that both vendors had the required items on their gsa schedules both vendors could meet the delivery requirements and that neopost’s quoted prices  and  were less than pitney bowes’ quoted prices  and   ar tab  quotation evaluation board report at   on january   the agency awarded the contracts to neopost  these protests followed discussion pitney bowes raises several challenges to the agency’s evaluation and award decision  the protester primarily argues in essence that award was improper because neopost’s proposed products differ significantly from pitney bowes’ brand name items and that in pitney bowes’ view some of the products lack the salient characteristics of pitney bowes’ items  the protester raises various examples of how the awardee’s items allegedly differ from its own items  as one example the protester complains that neopost’s handheld tracking device does not have “all the features” of pitney bowes’ tracking device including the ability to take pictures  protest at   the agency responds that its evaluation and award were reasonable because the awardee proposed items that met “the functional requirements of the rfqs and were therefore ‘equal’ to those offered by pitney bowes”  legal memorandum at   in this regard the agency explains that it was seeking to procure a mail tracking system with the ability to capture a signature showing proof of delivery and to retain a record of that signature in a database  ar tab  declaration of technical evaluation chair mar   at   the agency assessed whether the items quoted in neopost’s proposed system were able to meet these requirements and found the items to be acceptable  after considering all of pitney bowes’ arguments we find no basis to sustain the protest in reviewing a protest challenging an agency’s evaluation our office will neither reevaluate proposals nor substitute our judgment for that of the agency as the evaluation of proposals is a matter within the agency’s discretion  superior cleaning equipment inc b oct    cpd ¶  at   rather we will review the record only to determine whether the agency’s evaluation was reasonable and consistent with the stated evaluation criteria and with applicable procurement statutes and regulations  id at   moreover in a brand name or equal procurement such as here a product offered as an equal need not meet unstated features of the brand name product and where an agency does not include a list of salient characteristics in the solicitation it may not reject an “equal” quotation for noncompliance with a specific performance or design feature unless the offered item is significantly different from the brand name product  see j e pope co inc b may    cpd ¶  at  here we find unobjectionable the agency’s determination that neopost offered products from its fss contract that were essentially equal to the pitney bowes’ products listed in the solicitations thus satisfying the solicitation requirement that the items be brand name or equal  in this regard the record shows that neopost’s quotations provided items that were part of a “functionally equivalent” mail tracking system  see ar tab  declaration of fbi point of contact for shipping and receiving at   as explained above the fbi’s requirements were for mail tracking systems that had the capability to capture a signaturethus showing proof of deliveryand retain a record of that signature  the record reflects that the agency evaluated the functionalities of the items each vendor quoted and reasonably found that both vendors had quoted items that met the agency’s requirements for example neopost’s quotations included a handheld portable scanner which could read barcodes handle multiple packages delivered to multiple locations by a single courier capture the receiver’s signature upon delivery and retain the signature for download later to a database see ar tab  declaration of technical evaluation chair mar   at   while pitney bowes points out that neopost’s portable scanner lacks certain other features such as the ability to take pictures the failure to have these additional features does not demonstrate a flawed evaluation  in this respect the agency maintains that a camera and other features cited by pitney bowes were not necessary or required characteristics of the scanner as these features such as gps and cellular capability would not be utilized by the agency  declaration of technical evaluation chair mar   at   indeed the agency reports that the use of some features such as gps and cellular systems would violate agency security requirements  id  given this we see nothing unreasonable with the agency’s determination that neopost’s scanner was equivalent to the one listed in the solicitations  as another example pitney bowes also challenges the agency’s determination that neopost submitted equivalent items for clin  configuration project management found under solicitation no   pitney bowes interpreted the agency’s requirement here as the conversion of the existing database of tracking information to the new system  commentssupp protest at   the agency responds however that clin  was not for database conversion but was instead for “installing setting up and maintaining of whatever software system the vendor proposed” to meet the mail system’s tracking requirements  declaration of technical evaluation chair mar   at   while pitney bowes asserts that it submitted its quotation based on its understanding of clin  such that the agency’s different understanding of clin  constitutes a “latent” defect the protester’s interpretation of what the fbi required is not supported by the language of the solicitation such that there is no ambiguity or defect  thus we find nothing unreasonable about the agency’s determination that neopost met the clin  requirement for configuration project management even though neopost did not propose to convert the existing database as pitney bowes did given the agency’s broad discretion in evaluating quotations and the lack of any defined salient characteristics for each item being procured we have no basis to object to the agency’s determination that the awardee’s items met the requirements set forth in the solicitations  see superior cleaning equip inc supra at  see also fortune chem co inc b‑ apr    cpd ¶  at  protest that agency improperly made award to firm whose product was not “equal” is denied where agency reasonably found that awardee’s product was functionally equivalent for the intended application despite the lack of salient characteristics  based on the record before us we find that the agency reasonably determined that neopost quoted items that were equivalent to the brand name items identified in the solicitations the protest is denied susan a poling general counsel  fedbid inc is a commercial online procurement services provider that runs a website at fedbidcom  the solicitations refer to both bids and offers being requested and the agency report refers to quotations  for purposes of this decision we adopt the agency’s use of the term quotations  with regard to the evaluation criteria for award the solicitations stated among other things that “sellers understand that fedbid ranks all bids by price” and that “award will be made to the responsible seller whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the buyer on the basis of price technical capability delivery and past performance”  solicitation no  at  solicitation no  at   the protester essentially asserts that neopost quoted an older model of the scanner listed in the solicitations  commentssupp protest attach  declaration of pitney bowes’ federal systems engineer mar   at   in this regard pitney bowes asserts that neopost’s scanner lacks “gps and cellular capability” and has a “completely different operating system” that is slower less secure and at the end of its operational life  commentssupp protest at  attach  declaration of pitney bowes’ federal systems engineer mar   at    as an initial matter we disagree with the protester’s contention that certain features of its products were salient characteristics that were also required of neopost’s products  in this regard the solicitations permitted the submission of quotations offering equal products but contained no listing of the salient characteristics those products must meet  accordingly to the extent that pitney bowes now asserts that certain features of its products should have been viewed as salient characteristics and required this protest ground is untimely  in this respect the protester was required to raise the solicitations’ lack of salient characteristics prior to the closing time for receipt of quotations   cfr § a  the protester and agency also disagree over whether the item neopost proposed for server hardware met the solicitations’ requirements  in this regard the agency concedes that neopost quoted hard drives for these requirements whereas pitney bowes offered a server  however the agency argues that a hard drive was sufficient to meet the agency’s needs which consisted of retaining large amounts of data for at least two years  legal memorandum at   we need not determine whether the agency’s acceptance of this was proper because even if we were to find that the agency improperly waived the solicitation requirement for the awardee the record does not establish that pitney bowes was prejudiced by the agency’s acceptance of the hard drives  specifically the record shows that pitney bowes quoted  for the servers under solicitation no  and approximately  under solicitation no   even if pitney bowes instead were to have offered hard drives at no additional cost to the fbi as neopost did neopost would still have submitted the lowerpriced quotation  see lexisnexis risk solutions fl inc b‑ b jan    cpd ¶  at  where protester suffers no prejudice as a result of an alleged evaluation flaw our office will not sustain a protest  the protester also argues that the awards were improper because neopost failed to provide make model and descriptive literature of the items in its quotations as required by far clause b brand name or equal  we disagree  the record shows that for each clin in neopost’s quotations the vendor listed the clin number next to the make model number and description of the item in its fss contract  ar tab  neopost dec   reply at   consequently

restrictive of competition we sustain the protest document for public release the decision issued on the date below was subject to a gao protective order this redacted version has been approved for public release decision matter of  pitney bowes inc file  b date  february   william a shook esq the law offices of william a shook pllc for the protester david k barnes esq and holly h styles esq department of the treasury internal revenue service for the agency k nicole willems esq and jennifer d westfallmcgrail esq office of the general counsel gao participated in the preparation of the decision digest protest challenging technical specifications as unduly restrictive of competition is sustained where the record fails to show that the specifications are reasonably necessary to meet the agency’s needs decision pitney bowes inc of washington dc protests the terms of request for quotations rfq no tirmsr issued by the department of the treasury internal revenue service irs for the procurement of mail inserterfolder machines  pitney argues that the technical specifications set out in the solicitation are unduly restrictive of competition we sustain the protest background the rfq was issued via the general services administration’s gsa ebuy system on november    and contemplated the award of a fixedprice contract on a lowestpriced technically acceptable basis  the solicitation sought quotations for four ps folderinserters with four  sheet capacity sheet feeders and four ps high capacity feeders or equivalent machines to replace existing equipment used for document processing and mailing at the irs’s national distribution center ndc in bloomington illinois  co statement at   according to the solicitation the ndc is one of the irs facilities that processes and mails high volume turnaround letters including affordable care act compliance and earned income tax credit letters  rfq at  the rfq includes contract line item numbers clin that refer to the ps folderinserter and certain ps components  rfq at b  the statement of work sow however lists a number of specific requirements for the folderinserters which is consistent with the agency’s assertion that it intended the acquisition to be a procurement for the brand name ps equipment or an equivalent product that could meet the specifications in the sow  sow at  co statement at   the specifications include as relevant here   “a high capacity sheet feeder with a capacity of up to  per feeder with the capability of loading on the fly”  “a feeder swap capability for up to  sheet feeders per machine” and  “one envelope feeder to handle all types of envelopes from letters to flats”  rfq at  this protest was filed with our office on november  prior to the closing of the solicitation  the agency has indicated that the protester was among the vendors who submitted quotations  discussion pitney challenges specifications in the sow requiring high capacity sheet feeders that are capable of being loaded on the fly foldersinserters that have a feeder swap capability for up to  sheet feeders per machine and foldersinserters that have an envelope feeder capable of handling all types of envelopes from letters to flats  according to the protester the requirements are unduly restrictive of competition and amount to a de facto sole source requirement  based on the record we are unable to conclude that the specifications included in the rfq are necessary to meet the agency’s needs the determination of the government’s needs and the best method of accommodating them is primarily the responsibility of the procuring agency since its contracting officials are most familiar with the conditions under which supplies equipment and services have been employed in the past and will be utilized in the future  columbia imaging inc b b apr    cpd ¶  at   to the extent a protester challenges a specification as unduly restrictive that is challenges both the restrictive nature of the requirement as well as the agency’s need for the restriction the procuring agency has the responsibility of establishing that the specification is reasonably necessary to meet its needs  smith and nephew inc b jan    cpd ¶  at   the adequacy of the agency’s justification is ascertained through examining whether the agency’s explanation is reasonable that is whether it can withstand logical scrutiny  id here the protester challenges three specifications included in the sow  first the protester challenges the requirement for a high capacity sheet feeder with a  sheet capacity capable of being loaded on the fly  according to the agency load‑on‑the‑fly capability which would allow the insertion of additional sheets while the system is in operation is necessary to “minimize production time by allowing the equipment to be loaded while in operation”  ar at   according to the protester this requirement is overly restrictive because while the protester’s high capacity sheet feeders do not have loadonthefly capability the same continuous operation can be achieved by using two high capacity sheet feeders each holding  sheets  protest at   the protester’s approach would provide for items to be pulled from one feeder while the other feeder is filled  the machine would alternate between the feeders to provide continuous operation and avoid system interruption  protest at   while the agency appears to concede that pitney’s solution will provide for continuous operation it argues that the use of the protester’s approach would require additional employee time possibly resulting in more paper jams and require additional storage space  ar at   the agency’s arguments in this regard fail to establish that the load‑on‑the‑fly capability is necessary regarding the use of employee time the parties disagree as to whether it would be more efficient for employees to monitor and refill one tray on a machine with load‑on‑the‑fly capability or to monitor two trays on a machine like the protester’s that alternates between trays to achieve continuous use  while there are likely pros and cons to both continuous operation solutions we fail to see and the agency has not adequately shown why the protester’s solution would be more time consuming for employees  irs information technology specialist’s declaration january   at   with either approach employees would be monitoring a tray and inserting more sheets into a feeder as needed  with regard to the agency’s bare assertion that the use of two feeders increases the possibility of paper jams the agency has not provided anything to substantiate its claim  co statement at   casting some doubt on the agency’s assertion the protester argues that there is actually a benefit to the two feeder system in that unlike a system that relies on a single feeder with loadonthefly capability the use of two feeders would allow an operator to turn off the jammed feeder for repair while allowing the other feeder to continue operating  comments at   given the agency’s goal of maintaining continuous operation the protester’s argument is compelling  id additionally the agency argues that the use of two sheet feeders to achieve continuous operation would result in the need for additional storage space  ar at   in response pitney argueswithout rebuttal from the agencythat its equipment is designed to store the feeders such that no additional space would be required  comments at   in sum the agency has failed to provide a reasonable justification as to why a requirement for loadonthefly capability is necessary when a different approach may be able to achieve the same results in its november  protest pitney also challenges the requirement for the equipment to have a feeder swap capability for up to ten sheet feeders per machine  protest at   according to the protester this requirement which differed from the requirement in the original rfq for machines capable of accommodating up to ten additional module feeders each could only be met by one source  protest at   in its report the agency clarified that “module feeder” was synonymous with “sheet feeder”  co statement at   the protester responded that based on that clarification its equipment will be able to meet the requirement  comments at   accordingly because the protester has conceded that its equipment could satisfy the requirement for feeder swap capability for up to ten sheet feeders per machine we do not address further the argument that the requirement is restrictive of competition  finally the protester challenges the requirement that the folderinserter have one envelope feeder to handle all types of envelopes from letters to flats  protest at  according to the protester the standard envelope feeder for its proposed solution feeds a wide range of the most common types of envelope sizes and flats  federal government strategic manager for pitney affidavit december   at   for more unusual sizes the protester asserts that the process of removing a feed and inserting a new one would take less than  seconds  id  while the agency simply maintains that it needs a feeder that will handle all types of envelopes it provides no explanation as to why it needs a feeder that would handle envelope sizes and types that deviate from standard sized envelopes  additionally while the agency complains about the time and effort that would be required to insert a new feeder it has provided no information regarding whether and how often the insertion of a different feeder might actually be necessary  irs information technology specialist’s statement at   absent further support from the agency it is not clear why the agency would need an envelope feeder that could handle all types of envelopes given that there is no discussion of a need for types of envelopes that would fall outside of the range of standard types  here the agency has not provided a reasonable justification for its requirement that the folderinserters come equipped with one envelope feeder that can handle all types of envelopes from letters to flats conclusion and recommendation in sum we recognize that the irs is entitled to great discretion in establishing its needs  here however we find that the agency has failed to provide reasonable justifications for the challenged specifications such that we are unable to conclude that the challenged specifications are reasonably necessary for the agency to meet its needs we recommend that the agency make a documented determination of its needs  once the agency identifies its needs the agency should revise its rfq to include specifications that are reasonably necessary to meet those needs  we also recommend that pitney be reimbursed the costs of filing and pursuing the protest including reasonable attorneys’ fees   cfr § d  pitney should submit its certified claim for costs detailing the time expended and costs incurred directly to the contracting agency within  days after receipt of this decision  id § f the protest is sustained susan a poling general counsel  the rfq which was designated gsa ebuy no  was initially issued on august   and closed on august   in response to the initial rfq the agency received quotations from pitney and another company neopost usa  contracting officer co statement at   according to the protester pitney was initially selected for award but that award was successfully challenged at the agency level by neopost  protest at   neopost was subsequently selected for award on september   co statement at   pitney filed a protest of the award to neopost with our office on september  but withdrew its protest on october  after the agency decided to cancel the rfq and recompete its requirements  id at   we note that the solicitation provided to our office did not advise vendors of the basis for award and did not clearly indicate that the agency was seeking brand name ps equipment or its technical equivalent  here we rely on the information provided in the co statement which is not at issue in this protest  loadonthefly capability allows a user to load additional sheets into the feeder while the feeder is in operation  agency report ar at   the protester initially challenged two additional requirements  first pitney challenged a requirement that folderinserters have an envelope feeder capacity of  envelopes with load‑on‑the‑fly capability  pitney also challenged a requirement for a touch screen that controls all functions from start to finish  protest at   the protester withdrew its challenge to the first requirement after the agency confirmed that it would not find the protester’s equipment which only has a  envelope capacity to be technically unacceptable consistent with the agency’s response in the questions and answers conducted during competition under the original solicitation  ar at  comments on the ar at   the protester also withdrew its challenge to the requirement for the equipment to have a single touch screen that would control all functions after the agency in its agency report explained that it would accept a buttonbased control  ar at    in arguments attempting to justify this requirement the agency indicated that this requirement relates to an anticipated future need in which ndc will be required to insert ten documents per envelope  co statement at   in this regard the agency has argued that the protester’s machine will not be able to meet the requirement even though it has a feeder swap capability for up to ten sheet feeders  the agency argues that without load‑on‑the‑fly capability the protester’s machine would need to assign two feeders to each document swapping between feeders as described above in order to achieve continuous operation  ar at   in other words according to the agency to meet its future need for the capability to insert ten documents per envelope while maintaining continuous operation the protester’s machine would need to have twenty sheet feeders which would exceed its capacity  to the extent the agency’s requirement is for a machine with the capability to insert ten documents per envelope while maintaining continuous operation this was not clearly communicated in the rfq  given our recommendation that the agency revisit its requirements and revise its rfq accordingly the agency may want to consider whether a requirement stating the need to process jobs that include ten documents per envelope should be included in its solicitation   we note that in a supplemental filing the protester argued that while the rfq required that the new machines not exceed the footprint of the existing machines neopost’s machines when configured to meet the agency’s anticipated future need for the capability to insert ten documents per envelope discussed in footnote  exceed the size limitation  whether the size limitation in the current solicitation reasonably reflects the agency’s needs is another matter that the irs may wish to consider as it reassesses its requirements and revises the rfq find recent legal decisions  » explore related legal resources  » jul   rcr
