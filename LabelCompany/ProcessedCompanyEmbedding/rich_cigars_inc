relating to the registration of the common stock for the selling security holders we will be in competition with many large wellfinanced competitors in the market for premium cigars each of these better known companies enjoys strong brand names and a history of successful product launches these companies compete directly with us for consumer sales as well for supplies of tobacco and marketing resources all of these companies have substantially greater capital resources manufacturing sales and marketing experience and substantially longer and more extensive relationships with growers and longstanding brand recognition and market acceptance than we do we believe however that the market for premium cigars is growing rapidly enough to support the entry of new brands such as ours and that the inability of the entrenched competitors to meet current demand supports this position company description we were incorporated on july   under the laws of the state of florida rich cigars was established to manufacture and distribute cigars under the rich cigars brand name the companys founders seek to create a cigar that would appeal to aficionados of highquality handrolled premium cigars founder alfred rushing has been involved with the cigar industry for more than  years through rich cigars he intends to introduce new styles of premium cigars to build sales of private label cigars the company intends to conduct its business principally in the us through its sales and marketing team we intend to contract with a nicaraguan supplier for the manufacture of hand rolled cigars and market in the us in both units and dollars sales of brand name premium cigars imported handmade or handrolled cigars made with cuban seed long leaf filler and all natural tobacco leaf we intend to produce at least six premium lines for sales in the us we believe that higher priced branded premium cigars constitute the fastest growing segment of the premium cigar market we intend to sell under the name rich cigars this brand will be made from premium imported nicaraguan honduran dominican republic and brazilian cuban seed long leaf filler tobacco such as seco viso and ligero complimenting each cigar with one of six different wrappers connecticut shade connecticut broad leaf maduro sumatra oscuro habanna  and criollo we believe that increasing demand for cigars will offer us growth opportunities in recent years cigar smoking has experienced a resurgence resulting in an increase in consumption and retail sales of cigars especially in the premium cigar segment this growth produced overall retail sales in the us cigar market of approximately  billion in  the gain comes despite an increasingly unfriendly environment for smokers as a myriad of states enact smoking bans we believe that this increase in cigar consumption and retail sales is the result of a number of factors including i the improving image of cigar smoking resulting from increased publicity plus social media including the success of cigar publications and the visibility of cigar smoking by celebrities ii the emergence of an expanding base of younger highly educated affluent adults age  to  and the growing interest of this group in luxury goods including premium cigars iii the increase in the number of adults over the age of  a demographic group believed to smoke more cigars than any other demographic group and iv the opening of establishments such as restaurants and clubs and cigar bars where cigar smoking is encouraged as well as other special events for cigar smokers  we presently maintain our
