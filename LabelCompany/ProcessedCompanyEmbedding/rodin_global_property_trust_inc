holds fewer than one thousand  vested ltip units all of the ltip holder’s vested ltip units ltip holders shall not have the right to convert unvested ltip units into limited partnership units until they become vested ltip units provided however that when a ltip holder is notified of the expected occurrence of an event that will cause its unvested ltip units to become vested ltip units such

the conversion date provided however that the redemption of such limited partnership units by the partnership shall in no event take place until after the conversion date for clarity it is noted that the objective of this paragraph is to put an ltip holder in a position where if he or she so wishes the limited partnership units into which its vested ltip units will be converted can be redeemed by the partnership simultaneously with such conversion with the further    consequence that if the general partner elects to assume the partnership’s redemption obligation with respect to such limited partnership units under section  by delivering to such holder reit shares rather than cash then such holder can have reit shares issued to it simultaneously with the conversion of its vested ltip units into limited partnership units the general partner shall cooperate with an ltip holder to coordinate the timing of the different events described in the foregoing sentence d the partnership at

the applicable holder not less than  nor more than  days prior to the conversion date specified in such forced conversion notice a forced conversion notice shall be provided in the manner provided in section  e a conversion of vested ltip units for which a holder has given a conversion notice or the partnership has given a forced conversion notice shall occur automatically after the close of business on the applicable conversion date without any action on the part of such ltip holder as of which time such ltip holder shall be credited on the books and records of the partnership with the issuance as of the opening of business on the next day of an equal number of limited partnership units issuable upon such conversion after the conversion of ltip units as aforesaid the partnership shall deliver to such ltip holder upon its written request a certificate of the general partner certifying its limited partnership units and remaining ltip units if any immediately after such conversion f for purposes of making future allocations under section e and applying the capital account limitation the portion of the economic capital account balance of the applicable holder that is treated as attributable to its ltip units shall be reduced as of the date of conversion by the product of the number of ltip units converted and the limited partnership unit economic balance g if the partnership or the general partner shall be a party to any transaction including without limitation a merger consolidation interest exchange self tender offer for all or substantially all limited partnership units or other business combination or reorganization or sale of all or substantially all of the partnership’s assets but excluding any transaction which constitutes an adjustment event in each case as a result of which limited partnership units shall be exchanged for or converted into the right or the holders of such interests shall otherwise be entitled to receive cash securities or other property or any combination thereof each of the foregoing being referred to herein as a “ transaction ” then the general partner shall immediately prior to the transaction exercise its right to cause a forced conversion with respect to the ltip units then eligible for conversion taking into account any allocations that occur in connection with the transaction or that would occur in connection with the transaction if the assets of the partnership were sold at the transaction price or if applicable at a value determined by the general partner in good faith using the value attributed to the partnership units in the context of the transaction in which case the conversion date shall be the effective date of the transaction    in anticipation of such forced conversion and

consolidated or into with the partnership merged or which merged into the partnership or to which such sale or transfer was made as the case may be a “ constituent person ” or an affiliate of a constituent person in the event that holders of limited partnership units have the opportunity to elect the form or type of consideration to be received upon consummation of the transaction prior to such transaction the general partner shall give prompt written notice to each ltip holder of such election and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to afford such holders the right to elect by written notice to the general partner the form or type of consideration to be received upon conversion of the ltip units held by such holder into limited partnership units in connection with such transaction if an ltip holder fails to make such an election such ltip holder and any of its transferees shall receive upon conversion of the ltip units held by it or by any of its transferees the same kind and amount of consideration that a holder of limited partnership units would receive if such holder of limited partnership units failed to make such an election subject to the rights of the
