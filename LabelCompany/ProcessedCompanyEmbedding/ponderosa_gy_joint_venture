completed by july  michael bernard special to the sun it isn’t often that a developer can lay claim to saving a town but through some luck and timing richmondbased treegroup inc’s ponderosa development played just that role last fall the acre residential development was in the midst of shaping the golf course at the centre of the new community when winds and dry conditions whipped a nearby forest fire into a raging inferno forcing the rapid evacuation of  people from the west okanagan lake town of peachland  kilometres east of vancouver as it turned out the logging and excavating for the golf course’s ninth hole saved the day says peachland mayor keith fielding “it acted as a firebreak” fielding said this week “if that excavated area had not been in place the fire would have come up the ravine and crossed over to the major section of town and would have been significantly more dangerous” even before last fall’s fire the new community called ponderosa had been yielding benefits to the tiny lakeside town of  located about  minutes south of kelowna the billion development is the brainchild of treegroup which has been developing real estate in metro vancouver the bc interior and washington state for  years it is proving to be one of the best things to ever happen to peachland ironically it was another fire in october  that destroyed the muchloved ponderosa golf course clubhouse and hastened peachland’s entry into an new era of residential development and resort amenities previous developers had proposed building a subdivision in the area on a much smaller parcel of land however peachland rejected their plans because it didn’t include developing the homes and resurrecting the golf course so important to the district’s tourism and economic development treegroup stepped in and began to assemble sufficient land to do both in  it reached an innovative crown land deal with the westbank first nation that made the first nation a joint venture partner and gave ponderosa the critical mass it needed — about  acres in total — to proceed with the phased development at the centre of ponderosa is a yard golf course designed by australian golfing legend greg norman ponderosa’s first phase is a collection of  two and threebedroom townhomes grouped around the fourth hole most of the homes will have views of lake okanagan says keith funk who led his firm new town architecture’s creation of a master plan for the new residential community wrapped around pincushion mountain above the town “we needed to work in such a way that the real estate which pays for the golf course supported but didn’t undermine the value of the course say by encroaching on the fairways” said funk a former city planner for the cities of calgary and kelowna sales of the craftsmanstyle homes designed by funk’s partner patrick mccusker have been brisk with more than two thirds of them being snapped up in the past several months the townhomes feature ninefoot or higher ceilings expansive decks and patios whirlpool stainless steel appliances with an option to upgrade to kitchenaid or viking and granite countertops in the kitchens and bathrooms in the main living areas are wideplank engineered floors and napoleon gas fireplaces with stone surrounds a bonus is that all homes have the option of economical geothermal heating and cooling the trails is the first phase of the ponderosa master plan that includes a mix of different housing types eventually the new community will expand to more than  homes effectively doubling peachland’s population of  over the next  years clearing has already begun for the next phase called the pines a collection of  single family homes overlooking the soontobe developed village centre next to the golf clubhouse the village will include a skating plaza an amphitheatre commercial buildings and a hotel said funk the skating rink will convert to a market during the summer months also part of the village is a twoacre winery and destination restaurant that will feature wine tastings funk says affordable housing is a significant social issue in the okanagan and ponderosa’s master plan requires  per cent of all the housing fit within an affordable housing package “it is based on  per cent of the median income in the okanagan” said funk “if you are a family earning in the mid range we have a housing product for you” many of the buyers come from the okanagan valley metro vancouver and alberta says sales spokeswoman julia debolt among them are john and maureen goodrick who recently purchased a squarefoot three bedroom unit with a view of the lake “we’re in the process of a change in lifestyle and we’re trying to downsize our lives” goodrick said “we own a home in maple ridge and we own a home in indio calif what we wanted was a lockandleave situation in british columbia where we can go south in the winter” he and maureen were attracted to the architecture and interior design touches of the ponderosa townhouse “we don’t like a home to be chopped up into little rooms and alcoves and cubby holes it’s a very open design you can sit in the great room and almost converse with anyone anywhere in the house” straddling highway  peachland is wellsituated to reach any of the numerous amenities for which the valley is famous including skiing at apex alpine silver star and big white wineries north and south public beaches and good trout fishing in a chain of local lakes fielding notes that ponderosa along with another planned development has come along at a critical point “if we didn’t have these developments just to maintain our existing services we would have had to triple our taxes” he said instead peachland is looking forward to using the new amenity fund to pay for a variety of additional services including — to no one’s surprise — new fire trucks read more from communities okanagan comments are closed search summer  issue westcoast homes  design   homesanddesignca part of the
