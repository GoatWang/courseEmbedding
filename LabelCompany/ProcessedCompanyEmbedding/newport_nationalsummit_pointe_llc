people only take the time to express their concerns about a business on a review i believe that a standout place deserves the same time park place apartments in oyster point city center is one of those places the location speaks for itself with an abundance of dining and shopping options within walking distance ive lived all over newport news and have never felt safer than i do walking around oyster point the buildings require a key entry and parking is gated to further ensure safety the complex has all the facilities you would look for in a luxury apartment and added activities to make renters feel at home the ladies at the leasing office are very pleasant and welcoming while the maintenance staff is efficient and eager to assist when we moved in the apartment was spotlessnot a mark on the walls or a stain on the carpet the rental prices may seem expensive at first glance but are actually quite comparable to other luxury apartments in newport news plus they offer discounts to certain employers and on specific units i certainly recommend park place and i find it disappointing to see so many unhappy reviews apartment living can be tough i always choose the top floor to prevent having someone heavy footed above me but if you do you have to understand that theres only so much the leasing office can do to help we have neighbors on both sides of our apartment and rarely ever hear anything as i mentioned only those with an issue generally take the time to post a review if you are tired of mediocre apartment living give park place a call you will be impressed park place apartmentsdavid l ratedi lived there for  full year and here are the pro and cons of park placepronice clean fountain park you can play pokemon go thererelatively new building lots of doors for some reasonconroaches a in roach fell on top of me while i was sleeping in another instance a in bug fell on my girlfriend while she was sleeping hidden fees apparently there is a random  fee for moving out paid it anyways because i moved to a better establishment there is also a  late payment feemanagement they were very nice when they were showing me the apartment not very friendly when you are a renter this is consistent with other reviewersnoise i lived next to the garage cars are always revving up at am i woke up to it even though i am a deep sleepermisled my coworker they told her that there was a free one month promotion when she renewed for lease they told her the promotion was over coworker lost  on the mix upnote to future renters good luck beware of roaches in the vents andor while you sleepriver mews apartmentsraman c ratedoverall i would like to give river mews a star we had ups and downs during our stay but mostly it was good old management is really good whereas new hires i dont like them much place is clean quite and safe the only problem i had was bathrooms are small but that is my personal opinion if you have any maintenance request they never gave us any problem you ask for maintenance and mostly within same day it is done signing lease and moveout was simple and easy would definitely recommend it to my friends park place apartmentsmary h ratedi have
