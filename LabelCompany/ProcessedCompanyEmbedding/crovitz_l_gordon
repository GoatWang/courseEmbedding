court in washington considers the legality of the obama administration’s decision to micromanage the internet obamanet ended  glorious years of the internet as a fount of permissionless innovation now judges will decide in us telecom association v fcc if anyone can ever again launch a website app or new product without having to beg a bureaucrat the federal communications commission chairman himself last week made the case for invalidating obamanet asked at a news conference whether regulators would approve a new lowpriced plan from tmobile tom wheeler said yes adding “i also kind of chuckle at the fact that as we were debating the open internet everybody was saying ‘oh this is going to thwart innovation it’s going to be terrible people are going to have to come to the fcc to say “mother may i” before they do anything in the market’ well that certainly didn’t happen here” of course it did mother wheeler said you may—though that became maybe when he added “what we’re going to be doing is watching the binge on product keeping an eye on it and to measure it against the general conduct rule” republican commissioner ajit pai warned tmobile not to assume anything “i don’t think it should give any company comfort to know that the state of the law is so unsettled” more doug brady december   headlines share doug brady posts open thread posted on jul rd  sponsored content recent

more » imagine a newspaper oped with half a dozen fallacies such a thing could appear in any newspaper in the us but now imagine that the author is a rhodes scholar and you’re left with the wall street journal’s l gordon crovitz for years i’ve followed the bizarre arguments of l gordon crovitz who has a weekly column on information policy in the wall street journal it’s part of my daily routine of reading the journal which is great for business news but something else for everything else last week crovitz wrote a real howler arguing that the internet was really created by xerox not the government because among xerox’s many great inventions was ethernet of course the internet is the world’s biggest copying machine but xerox itself doesn’t claim to have invented the internet a chorus of more well informed people attempted to correct crovitz including the author of the book crovitz relied upon to support his argument but the damage is already done the libertarian claque is parroting crovitz as part of its mission to undermine any of the good deeds done by the government perhaps crovitz was attempting to cure the largest source of cognitive dissonance for the libertarians that the libertarians’ favorite invention the internet was funded by the source of all evil our federal government this single unfortunate fact may be enough to cure the manichean mind of the libertarian and thus it must be attacked one column does not completely undermine one’s claim to be an expert in information issues but crovitz has a track record of reactionary inaccurate and incoherent essays on issues of importance for example just the week before crovitz made a series of disconnected arguments and inaccurate observations about privacy dear reader let me guide you through the sad times of the disinformation age the way the digital cookie crumbles if regulators and lawyers limit the use of data advertising online will become less efficient typically editors write headlines so we have to give gordon a pass on this assertion for a measure of how technology is changing human expectations consider the “cookies” on your computers these invisible text files are how websites track activity delivering to marketers detailed information about individual behavior and preferences in exchange for data we get highly personalized online services i’m not sure what an “invisible” text file is one that is empty one that your operating system does not allow you to see in any case cookies are not invisible to marketers who are attempting to track our every move online this fact has been detailed by crovitz’s own paper in the what they know series crovitz also engages in a false analogy here which is more fully developed later yes cookies enable tracking but what websites choose to do with that data is different based the business model of the site some tracking such as when one shops on amazon and receives product recommendations are an example of a personalized service that individuals can choose to enjoy most tracking does not deliver personalized services—it attempts to deliver advertising of all sorts my work shows that when asked internet users overwhelmingly reject the value proposition that crovitz lionizes crovitz goes on to describe an example of differential pricing on the web where for instance certain consumers were presented with more expensive products or services because they were apple users … when orbitz used these data to feature higherpriced hotels more prominently in apple users’ search results privacy lobbyists claimed outrage but even in the analog era readers of this newspaper saw advertisements for different products and services than readers of less highend papers of course the analog and digital eras are completely different contextual advertising the idea that one places ads consistent with the publication such as ads for golf balls in a golf magazine is not privacy invasive at all in fact in the analog era the journal could not tell whether you even read the newspaper at all—only that you were a subscriber or not in the digital era newspapers are designed specifically to encourage the user to click more so that precise interests can be mapped and advertising dollars maximized a change to a more informationrich medium may justify a change in privacy rules these uses of personal data can seem a bit creepy but the evidence also shows how quickly consumers have gotten used to being tracked when given the choice few consumers opt out of cookies people accept the benefits of more relevant ads and more personalized websites in exchange for letting marketers track their interests this single paragraph demonstrates a complete lack of familiarity with the research that has been done in privacy and is descriptively inaccurate marketers complain bitterly about consumers deleting cookies and research has shown that even popular websites have resorted to hidden and nearlyimpossible to avoid tracking to address this consumer rejection crovitz’s larger point that people do not opt out is backwards as well consumers can get used to a lot of things if those things are hidden from them and they are offered no real choice about the matter in reality consumers think that they are protected by strong privacy laws my research has shown that consumers mistakenly believe that privacy policies impose strong legallyenforceable limits on the use of data …consumers are loyal to amazon in part because of its recommendation tools—if you liked that book you may like this one—which mine user data to determine relevancy… here again crovitz does not present an important wrinkle in the privacy debate first party tracking may be a “feature” that consumers desire consumers may use amazoncom specifically for its recommendations research shows that most cookies on popular websites are delivered by third parties typically companies that track individuals for advertising purposes left alone people would continue to make their own evolving judgments about how much data to share instead regulators issue edicts the federal trade commission has extracted year consent decrees from google facebook twitter and myspace giving regulators broad review over their privacy and data practices this would be fine if the purpose were to ensure that companies comply with disclosures about how they use data but the ftc wants to define privacy standards and here the libertarian paranoia emerges in full–regulators have nothing better to do but issue edicts which are fully untethered from consumers’ desires here again the manichean nature of the libertarian is exposed—regulation is so evil that it has to be spawned by evil people with evil motives in reality american consumers strongly support some definition of privacy standards no congressperson has ever lost office for passing a privacy law the ftc under republican leadership was in fact the progenitor of the most successful privacy edict of all—the telemarketing donotcall registry the ftc predicted that only about  million numbers would be enrolled last i checked over  million numbers were enrolled the ftc’s consent decrees all flowed from situations where companies made promises that were false or reneged upon and in each case the company agreed to the decree—making it a “consent decree” if these were real edicts these companies could have litigated them they don’t litigate them because in the course of a typical investigation triggered by a misrepresentation the ftc finds lots of other privacy problems one result of ftc meddling is that plaintiff lawyers have open invitations to file nuisance suits on behalf of supposed privacy victims a federal judge is considering a  million settlement offer by facebook which has agreed to make its disclosures clearer that when users click “like” to promote a product on facebook their names and photos can be used the paranoia continues plaintiff lawyers file suits regardless of what the government does or doesn’t do and these cases often result in cy pres remedies given to organizations such as berkeley law that work on privacy and information policy if regulators and lawyers push too hard to limit the use of cookie data advertising online will become less efficient this in turn will reduce the amount of free advertisingsupported services enjoyed by consumers such as social media entertainment and email i think this argument hints at a core problem in the cookie debate—a false dilemma between a completely unregulated and fully tracked world and regulation any of which would kill the golden goose of course there are middleway approaches crovitz’s argument assumes that online advertising in its current form is the most efficient but in fact more privacyfriendly systems may be more efficient for instance the dma claims that telemarketing is now more efficient perhaps this is because those who didn’t want to buy can opt out crovitz’s false dilemma also shows that he is committed to a certain business model there are alternative methods for highlytailored advertising that could be completely private but these alternatives require more work and the industry has settled on a lazy approach that prioritizes tracking everyone even those who opt out all the time …each consumer should be able to decide how to make this tradeoff between sharing data and getting advertisingsupported services i wonder if crovitz really means this because the ftc is considering “donottrack” a method that would allow each individual consumer to decide whether or not to be tracked online so perhaps the ftc is good after all the industry currently offers no way to take this decision even if you opt out they track you the privacy debate shows how naive silicon valley firms were to sign year agreements granting washington regulators broad authority over how they operate digital entrepreneurs should be allowed to innovate freely with consumers also free to choose their individual tradeoff between how their data are used and the benefits they get in return overregulation is the way the digital cookie crumbles in other words silicon valley firms were naïve to agree to consent decrees on the advice of the most sophisticated welltrained lawyers in the world if they only had louis gordon crovitz they would have decided differently and the market would be free at last share thistwitteremailfacebooktumblr  more » comments  disinformation about disinformation – denialism blog august   … crovitz recently wrote about the invention of the

journalism plus after years of hearing very different situations repeatedly compared to pre wwii i’m reminded of the boy who cried wolf iran has more to gain from nuclear energy for their people than nuking israel which has had nukes since it secretly developed them nearly  years ago as they now accuse iran of doing as iran is flanked by known nuclear nations and us military presence if they

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
