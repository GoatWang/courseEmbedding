hedge funds private equity liquid alts people moves regulation halls of justice institutional tech  services indices in depth contributors lifestyle harbourvest partners launches mezzanine coinvestment and real assets funds apr    pm et global private markets investment manager harbourvest partners has raised  million and  million respectively for its inaugural mezzaninefocused coinvestment fund and its third real assets fund the company’s mezzanine income fund i was oversubscribed and closed well above its  million target the fund’s hard cap was  million  harbourvest’s approach to the mezzanine market enables investors to access companies primarily in the us lower middle market the company said in a statement and across some of the very best managers who invest in this area this access is achieved via a differentiated mezzanineequity strategy “what differentiates harbourvest is our strong equity orientation which brings with it a unique way of looking at mezzanine and engaging with gps” said peter lipson managing director of harbourvest in the statement “our roots in equity allow us to be more agile in terms of how we structure deals it also better aligns us with the sponsor and makes us a more valued mezzanine partner”  “harbourvest has been investing in mezzanine since  and over the last decade we’ve seen consistent growth in the demand from private equity sponsors for mezzanine debt partners to help complete transactions” added lipson “our dedicated mezzanine debt solution will continue to differentiate harbourvest as a preferred partner to gps while being highly complementary to our direct coinvestment equity business –particularly in terms of accessing and evaluating deals” meanwhile harbourvest’s real assets fund iii is the company’s first commingled real assets fund the secondary vehicle closed well above its  million target  the new fund’s strategy will leverage harbourvest’s dover street secondary investment approach and apply it to the less competitive but fastgrowing real assets market the fund’s objective is to invest opportunistically across the energy power infrastructure and natural resources sectors the company said  “the real assets market has gone from a niche component of the broader secondary market to a level of maturity where it is now viewed as a segment standing on its own” said kevin warnschindel managing director at harbourvest “the dynamics of this early stage maturity is comparable to the early days of the pe secondary market itself where the growth in the demand for liquidity continues to lag the availability of capital to provide it  “as the market continues to mature we are seeing more gp spinout and gpled transactions trickle into the space” he added limited partners in both funds more than half of which are new to harbourvest consist of pension funds insurance companies endowments and family offices across the us canada latin america asia and europe founded in  and headquartered in boston harbourvest manages more than  billion in primary fund investments secondary investments and direct coinvestments in comingled funds or separately managed accounts the company

ability to meet and anticipate client needs we are particularly proud that half of the limited partners in these funds are new to harbourvest demonstrating that these offerings are consistent with our strategic plan to grow our client base” mezzanine coinvestment fund mezzanine income fund i was oversubscribed and closed above its  million target at its hard cap of  million “harbourvest has been
