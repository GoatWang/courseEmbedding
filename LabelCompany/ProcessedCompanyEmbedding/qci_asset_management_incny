an intern less than a yearprosequity research senior analysts and portfolio managers are extremely helpful their doors always open from day one they give you a direction to go in and they teach you on the fly if you cannot learn quickly you will struggle in this role as they teach you the fundamentals of equity research very quickly and expect you to apply these concepts and ideas to create internal research reports however someone is always willing to help you should you have a question or issue they get you working with a number of partners and employees across multiple divisions and have you work on ad hoc projects in between your research work to give you broad based exposure the experience you get with factset and bloomberg is unrivaled you are encouraged to join the investment team for cfa society and sell side analyst meetings  and you are expected to present and support your research at investment committee meetings i dont think you can get this kind of experience as an intern anywhere else other than summer analyst programs at bulge bracket banks oh and the cherry on top of the sundae its a business casual office thats right no suit jackets or ties necessary to top

is the difference between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a bing ads specialist at and we’ll set up your first
