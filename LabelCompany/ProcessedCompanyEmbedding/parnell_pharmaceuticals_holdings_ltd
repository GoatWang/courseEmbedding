conclusion investors should avoid parn we plan to avoid this ipo we hear the underwriters may need to lower the price to get this puppy launched though parn already has numerous products already available in multiple markets the firm is losing money and theres little evidence that further product development will reverse the companys fortunes in any case the firms plans to release further products are far from guaranteed as parn will have to satisfy the regulatory bodies of various countries in order to bring their products to market parns ipo underwriting is less than impressive and competition is fierce we see little reason to bet on this firm disclosure the author has no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours the author
