gulf coast is the supply and demand hub that serves the region the surge in shale oil production over the past five years combined with the us ban on crude oil exports has driven a boom in refined

the gulf coast while the gulf coast refineries are benefitting from access to lower cost crude oil other states without refining capacity including florida depend on imports of refined petroleum
