project is considered senior living fund gives investors insider access to these prevetted developments   senior living as an asset class has been historically difficult for average investors to

astute individual investors can also capitalize on these trends and earn strong yields in a proven niche   on a national macro level the demographic trends are clear the rapidly aging population is
