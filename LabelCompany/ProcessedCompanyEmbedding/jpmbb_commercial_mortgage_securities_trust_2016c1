secured by  properties the ratings are based on the collateral and the structure of the transaction moodys cmbs ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate and structured finance analysis based on commercial real estate analysis moodys determines the credit quality of each mortgage loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis under structured finance the credit enhancement for each certificate typically depends on the expected frequency severity and timing of future losses moodys also considers a range of qualitative issues as well as the transactions structural and legal aspects the credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors  moodys assessment of the probability of default which is largely driven by each loans dscr and  moodys assessment of the severity of loss upon a default which is largely driven by each loans ltv ratio the moodys actual dscr of x is higher than the  transactions averages of x but lower than the cmbs  conduit transaction average of x the moodys stressed dscr of x is inline with the  conduit transaction average of x but below the cmbs  conduit transaction average of x the pooled trust loan balance

the moodys ltv ratio rises to  moodys also grades properties on a scale of  to  best to worst and considers those grades when assessing the likelihood of debt payment the factors considered include property age quality of construction location market and tenancy the weighted average moodys quality grade for the pool is  which is inline with the average grade of transactions rated in  however the pools top  loans  of the pool balance have a very strong weighted average property quality grade of  the five loans are of superior real estate quality evidenced by assigned grades between  and  the

aaa sf class with  credit enhancement although the additional enhancement offered to the senior most certificate holders provides additional protection against pool loss the supersenior structure is credit negative for the certificate that supports the supersenior class if the support certificate were to take a loss the loss would have the potential to be quite large on a percentage basis thin tranches need more subordination to reduce the probability of default in recognition that their lossgiven default is higher this adjustment helps keep expected loss in balance and consistent across deals the transaction was structured with additional subordination at class as to mitigate the potential increased severity to class as the principal methodology used in these ratings was approach to rating us and canadian conduit fusion cmbs published in december  please see the ratings methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology moodys review used the excelbased cmbs conduit model which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions credit enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type moodys actual and stressed dscr and moodys property quality grade which reflects the capitalization rate moodys uses to estimate moodys value moodys fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents  or greater of the current pool balance moodys analysis also used the excelbased cmbs io calculator which references the following inputs to calculate the proposed io rating based on the published methodology original and current bond ratings and credit estimates original and current bond balances grossed up for losses for all bonds the ios references within the transaction and io type corresponding to an io type as defined in the published methodology please see the ratings methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology moodys parameter sensitivities if moodys value of the collateral used in determining the initial rating were decreased by   and  the modelindicated rating for the currently rated senior aaa sf class would be aaa sf aa sf a sf respectively parameter sensitivities are not intended to measure how the rating of the security might migrate over time rather they are designed to provide a quantitative calculation of how the initial rating might change if key input parameters used in the initial rating process differed the analysis assumes that the deal has not aged parameter sensitivities only reflect the ratings impact of each scenario from a quantitativemodelindicated standpoint qualitative factors are also taken into consideration in the ratings process so the actual ratings that would be assigned in each case could vary from the information presented in the parameter sensitivity analysis these ratings a are based solely on information in the public domain andor information communicated to moodys by

dishonesty andor willful misconduct or any other type of liability that by law cannot be excluded on the part of or any contingency beyond the control of moodys or any of its employees or agents including any losses arising from or in connection with the procurement compilation analysis interpretation communication dissemination or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating the performance expectations for a given variable indicate moodys forwardlooking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term performance that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collaterals credit quality is stronger or weaker than moodys had previously anticipated factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan paydowns or amortization an increase in the pools share of defeasance or overall improved pool performance factors that may cause a downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance of the pool loan concentration increased expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls regulatory disclosures for further specification of moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis see the sections methodology assumptions and sensitivity to assumptions of the disclosure form further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement mechanisms available to investors are available on httpwwwmoodyscomviewresearchdocaspxdocidpbssf the analysis includes an assessment of collateral

press release and identifies each affected issuer ratings rationale please click on this link httpwwwmoodyscomviewresearchdocaspxdocidpbssf for the list of affected credit ratings this list is an integral part of this press release and provides for each of the credit ratings covered moodys disclosures on the following items principal methodologies the upgrades of eight cmbs io classes and the downgrades of  cmbs io classes follow the publication of moodys approach to rating structured finance interestonly io securities published on  june  the updated io methodology and reflect the rating impact of our updated approach incorporating performance information as of the may  remittance dates the updated methodology modifies moodys approach to rating io securities referencing multiple bonds and single or multiple collateral pools with realized losses references made to the exclusion of certain io securities in the previous methodology were removed in addition a description was added to explain when an io bond is viewed as having effectively matured and results in the withdrawal of the rating the updated methodology explains that moodys will limit the rating of an io security to no more than five notches above the rating of the lowest credit quality reference bond or the rating that would be assigned based on an assessment of the default probability of the reference pools as applicable and clarifies that the collateral pools default probability typically will be treated as equivalent to casf if a loss is expected on the pool the methodology also explains how moodys year idealised cumulative loss rates table will be used to determine the rating of ios referencing multiple bonds and ios backed by single or multiple pools as well as how the table is used when the loss falls between two rating categories this press release is not intended to provide a summary of the methodology for a full explanation of the methodology please consult the updated report now available on wwwmoodyscom and accessible at httpswwwmoodyscomresearchmoodysupdatesitsapproachforratingstructuredfinanceinterestonlypr ratings on  of the interestonly classes from  deals were withdrawn due to the excess spread due on the io bond being reduced to zero and are treated as having effectively matured the upgrades of eight cmbs io classes were due to the modification of moodys approach to rating io securities referencing multiple bonds including wac ios to the weighted average of the current credit quality of all referenced bonds based on current balances grossed up for realized losses subject to the constraint of no more than five notches above the lowest credit quality referenced bond the downgrades on  cmbs io classes were due to i the rating limit of an io security to no more than five notches above the lowest credit quality referenced bond ii the use of moodys year idealised cumulative loss rates table to determine the rating of ios referencing multiple bonds and the mapping to the next lower category when the loss falls between two rating categories and iii principal paydowns of higher quality reference classes as of the may  remittance statements factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the ratings an io class may be subject to ratings upgrades if there is an improvement in the credit quality of its referenced classes subject to the limits and provisions of the updated io methodology an io class may be subject to ratings downgrades if there is i a decline in the credit quality of the reference classes andor ii paydowns of higher quality reference classes subject to the limits and provisions of the updated io methodology regulatory disclosures for further specification of moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis see the sections methodology assumptions and sensitivity to assumptions of the disclosure form the analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments as a second step moodys estimates expected collateral losses or cash flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement loss allocation and other structural features to derive the expected loss for each rated instrument moodys did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis for ratings issued on a program series or categoryclass of debt this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of
