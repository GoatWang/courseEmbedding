donate online giving partnership package pledge form contact tac  registration praise the lord – i description product description we have heard the word “praise” so often as nothing else in the christian world believers greet each other with the words “praise the lord” the things that praising the lord could accomplish are much more than what we could humanly comprehend there is nothing that can take the place of praise in the spiritual world there is life in praise our praises can do great damage in the enemy’s kingdom psalm   says “out of the mouth of babes and nursing infants you have ordained strength because of your enemies that you may silence the enemy and the avenger” when we as children of god begin to praise god god starts moving on our behalf god is the one who does the battle the bible says “the battle belongs to the lord” our god is the mighty warrior the bible repeatedly says that the lord will fight for us when can you activate our god to fight that is when you begin to praise it is very simple yet profound on the other hand our praises silences the enemy silence is the word that we are meditating on in other words the mouth of the enemy is bound when we praise god that is why the enemy tries to keep us from praising he often reminds us of the negative things that happened to us he tells us that we do not have what it takes and on and on and on look at the life of david he had to flee for his life from his very own son absalom david did not get down and discouraged he began to praise the lord psalm   says “but you o lord are a shield for me my glory and the one who lifts up my head” the way the lord comes through is just amazing david said in paslm   b “…for you have struck all my enemies on the cheekbone you have broken the teeth of the ungodly” here david knows the secret of praise and also knows what happens to the enemy when we praise god the lord is no respecter of persons if he did it for david he will do it for you he is just as committed to you as he is to david when we praise god we literally silence our enemies the enemy keeps talking to us day and night about things that are not the will of god for us therefore it becomes necessary for us to silence him if we do not silence the enemy he will continue to talk defeat into our lives and that is the reason we often feel so beat up at the end of the day praise shuts satan up satan always keeps blabbering into the ears of people viz television radio and other avenues he loves to discourage god’ people he tempts us continually one of the key areas he operates is by talking all day long the enemy tirelessly talks criticism and condemnation it is the believer’s responsibility to stop him in the garden of eden the enemy talked to eve about something that was not true he is still talking into the ears of god’ people who would let him do you know who has the key to make the enemy keep quiet we have the key you and i have the key imagine we putting the enemy in a place where he cannot talk that is exactly what we do to the enemy when we begin to praise the lord we read in the bible that david’s praise would calm down the enemies of king saul  samuel   says “and it came to pass when the evil spirit from god was upon saul that david took an harp and played with his hand so saul was refreshed and was well and the evil spirit departed from him” before the walls of jericho fell we see that the army marched around the walls each day seven priests would blow the trumpets the people who were marching in the front were the trumpeters this is because praise is such an important component for victory joshua    says “it shall come to pass when they make a long blast with the ram’s horn and when you bear the sound of the trumpet that all the people shall shout with a great shout then the wall of the city will fall down flat and the people shall go up every man straight before him” then joshua the son of num called the priests and said to them “take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the lord” what are the kinds of walls are you facing today if you want those walls to fall down begin praising the lord for who he is right now may the lord help you praise the lord in jesus’ name amen experiencing the holy spirit we are offering this book for any donation to the potters ministries
