putting concepts to work diversifying by investment type or style points to remember diversification is a basic concept that’s critical to building a portfolio able to withstand the test of time it is the process of spreading your money among a variety of securities to reduce exposure to any one investment or asset class the premise behind diversification is easy to grasp when you diversify across a range of investments you may reduce risk by creating the potential for better performers to compensate for poor performers effective diversification involves more than simply owning a jumble of different investments it means selecting a mix of securities that may not react the same to a given set of conditions — investments that carry a low correlation to one another correlation is a statistical measure of the degree to which two securities perform the same under particular market conditions for instance if you choose stocks of two companies that make the same product and serve the same market chances are that they will move in tandem when conditions affecting their industry change owning both would be unlikely to lower risk in your portfolio alternatively owning stocks of companies that operate in different segments of the economy may help improve your riskadjusted return although past performance is no guarantee of future results see chart diversifying by industry as this chart demonstrates combining stocks from different industries or sectors — financial services telecommunications services and health care in this case — may potentially result in a portfolio that has less risk than the individual industries or sectors of course the portfolio may also have somewhat lower returns than some of the individual industries or sectors — a tradeoff that longterm investors may be willing to make diversification vs asset allocation on its most basic level diversification can be applied to asset classes — allocating your investments among the three fundamental asset classes stocks bonds and cash your asset allocation is the percentage of money you decide to put into each asset class based on your goals risk tolerance and time horizon technically speaking asset allocation may potentially reduce market risk diversification potentially reduces companyspecific risk together they may help reduce portfolio volatility over time keep in mind that neither diversification nor asset allocation guarantees against investment losses both asset allocation and diversification are particularly important when a market takes an unexpected downturn in such a shift some investments are inevitably affected more than others and the overall effect of a downturn on a diversified portfolio may potentially be mitigated consider the investor who invested 00 in information technology stocks from january  0 through december  0 as represented by the total returns of the sp 0 information technology index he would have lost approximately  of his investment if the same investor had diversified his holdings to encompass a broad representation of all stocks by investing for instance in an index fund that paralleled the sp 0 index he would have lost about  over this period if the same investor had further diversified his portfolio by allocating  to cash and  to longterm us bonds and invested the remainder in the same index fund he would have narrowed his losses to about  putting concepts to work the first step in building a diversified portfolio is to determine your asset allocation how you diversify your portfolio among stocks bonds and cash will depend upon your specific goals your time horizon and your risk tolerance a financial advisor can help you determine an allocation that suits your specific needs you’ll also want to revisit your asset allocation on an annual basis making appropriate alterations depending upon your goals with your allocations determined you’re ready to begin choosing investments for each asset class here you have two basic options the first is to research and assemble individual securities for your stock bond and cash allocations taking this route however can require a significant amount of research in addition you would need to commit adequate time to monitor and manage the individual securities alternatively you could diversify by selecting a mix of mutual funds or exchangetraded funds because they hold baskets of securities such pooled funds provide instant diversification although the degree of diversification varies depending upon each fund’s investment strategy a fund that replicated a broad market benchmark such as the sp 0 would provide greater diversification than a fund specializing in one sector of the economy such as utilities or health care diversifying by investment type or style within the different asset classes you can also diversify your holdings by investment type or style for stocks there are a number of different styles to choose from growth vs value largecap vs smallcap domestic vs foreign or by sector or industry group these and other style groups are all represented by numerous mutual funds and may react differently to market circumstances for bonds there are many different types to select from you may choose to diversify by type government agency municipal corporate maturity credit quality or specific bond features keeping in mind that different bonds react differently to market interest rates and other factors however you choose to diversify your portfolio remember that diversification works two ways although it can cushion the impact of a falling market it can also dilute returns on the upside ultimately you should balance your degree of diversification with your overall appetite for risk points to remember effective diversification involves more than simply owning a jumble of different investments it means selecting a mix of securities that may not react the same to a given set of conditions — investments that carry a low correlation to one anotheron its most basic level diversification can be applied to asset classes — allocating your investments among the three fundamental asset classes stocks bonds and cashhow you diversify your
