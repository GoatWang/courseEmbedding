credit institutions stabilisation act am cmplt ¶  according to plaintiffs the act permits the irish minister for finance to obtain on an ex parte basis orders from the high court of ireland to inter alia make proposed direction orders or subordinated liabilities orders without providing notice am cmplt ¶  plaintiffs argue that once a subordinated liabilities order is effective    it would eliminate any contractual or equitable remedies that creditors such as noteholders may have — including the right to commence proceedings against the relevant institution to bring petitions to wind up the relevant institution or to exercise a right of setoff against the relevant institution am cmplt ¶  the bank disputes plaintiffs interpretation of the act and its significance firstly the credit stabilisation act does not simply by its existence expressly modify or eliminate the terms of agreements governed by laws outside of the republic of ireland or in certain circumstances those of other members of the european economic area secondly to the extent that the rights of any subordinated creditor are modified by a subordinated liabilities order under the terms of the credit stabilisation act there are express rights for such a creditor to apply to have such an order set aside varied or amended on various grounds thirdly no subordinated liabilities order has been made bradley decl ¶

inbs another financial institution that has been nationalized by the irish government id ¶  at the august   hearing the court received additional evidence concerning the banks merger with inbs and its disposal of its us loan portfolio james bradley the banks interim chief financial officer testified that the bank was in the process of marketing its approximately  billion usbased loan portfolio and planned a winding down of the bank over the next seven to ten years aug   tr   bradley also testified that the bank had merged with inbs q also since this case began anglo irish has merged with another bank is that correct a we were instructed to merge on the st of july q and the bank you merged with is another irish bank called irish nationwide building society a thats correct q and under the directives of the irish government that bank is also being wound down is that correct a its part of anglo now and in fact when we call it a merger the assets and liabilities were transferred into anglo irish so i know its referred to as a merger but technically i dont know if thats a merger or not it was a transfer of assets by once again the irish court instructing inbs to transfer their assets and liabilities into anglo q and now that all those assets are into anglo theyre being wound down just like the anglo assets is that correct a over that seven to tenyear period thats correct aug   tr  recent press reports submitted by plaintiffs indicate that the bank may complete the sale of its usbased loan portfolio as early as the end of november  nov   smith ltr discussion defendants contend that this action must be dismissed because  plaintiffs cannot overcome the presumption of immunity afforded anglo irish as a foreign state def first supp br  and  plaintiffs requested relief constitutes a prohibited prejudgment attachment that is precluded by operation of the fsia def br  plaintiffs argue however that  the court has jurisdiction because the bank waived immunity and because noteholders claims are based on the banks commercial activities and  noteholders seek injunctive relief — not an attachment — so that the bank is not immune and in any event the bank waived immunity from attachment by consenting in the npa to actions against its properties pltf first supp br  under  usc § a federal district courts have subject matter jurisdiction over any nonjury civil action against a foreign state as defined in  usc section a   as to any claim for relief in personam but the scope of the district courts jurisdiction is limited to actions for which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity either under  usc sections     or under any applicable international agreement  usc § a under the fsia a foreign state is presumptively immune from the jurisdiction of united states courts unless a specified exception in the act applies or an international agreement extant when the fsia was enacted provides otherwise a federal court lacks subjectmatter jurisdiction over a claim against a foreign state saudi arabia v nelson  us    citing verlinden bv v central bank of nigeria  us     usc §  subject to existing international agreements to which the united states is a party at the time of the enactment of the fsia a foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the united states    the issue here thus turns on whether the bank is a foreign state under the fsia and if so whether a treaty obligation or statutory exception to the immunity provided by the fsia applies where a defendant is a foreign state within the meaning of the fsia and no statutory exception to sovereign immunity or treaty obligation provides a basis for subject matter jurisdiction the action must be dismissed see eg commercial corp sovrybflot v corporacion

owned by a foreign state or political subdivision thereof and  which is neither a citizen of a state of the united states as defined in section c and e of this title nor created under the laws of any

once the defendant presents a prima facie case that it is a foreign sovereign the plaintiff has the burden of going forward with evidence showing that under exceptions to the fsia immunity should not be granted although the ultimate burden of persuasion remains with the alleged foreign sovereign quoting cabiri v govt of the republic of ghana  fd   d cir  hrrep no   cong d sess   reprinted in  uscode cong  adminnews   the burden will remain on the foreign state to produce evidence in support of its claim of immunity thus evidence must be produced to establish that a foreign state or one of its subdivisions agencies or instrumentalities is the defendant in the suit and that the plaintiffs claim relates to a public act of the foreign state — that is an act not within the exceptions in sections  once the foreign state has produced such prima facie evidence of immunity the burden of going forward would shift to the plaintiff to produce evidence establishing that the foreign state is not entitled to immunity the ultimate burden of proving immunity would rest with the foreign state plaintiffs offer two arguments in support of their contention that the bank is not immune from suit first plaintiffs contend that ireland waived    immunity either explicitly or by implication see  usc § a according to plaintiffs ireland waived its agencies and instrumentalities sovereign immunity by entering into the  treaty of friendship commerce and navigation with the united states the friendship treaty pltf first supp br  plaintiffs further contend that — in nationalizing the bank in  — ireland waived sovereign immunity pltf first supp br  second plaintiffs argue that the commercial activity exception to immunity under the fsia applies the fsia provides that a foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the united states    in any case in which the action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the united states by the foreign state or upon an act performed in the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere or upon an act outside the territory of the united states in connection with a commercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act causes a direct effect in the united states     usc § a plaintiffs contend that all three clauses of § a are applicable here pltf first supp br

united states and the republic of ireland — and does not purport to extend to parties of a third country like the funds def first supp br  emphasis in original the bank has the better of the argument plaintiffs have presented no legal authority suggesting that they — as cayman islands entities am cmplt ¶¶   — are entitled to claim a benefit from a treaty entered into by ireland and the united states as a general principle of international and united states law a treaty creates neither rights nor obligations in regards to a state which is not a party to that treaty unless of course it

be made toward these ends by arrangements establishing mutual rights and privileges and promoting mutually advantageous commercial intercourse have resolved to conclude a treaty of friendship commerce and navigation    emphasis added nothing in the text of the friendship treaty suggests that ireland intended to waive immunity as to thirdparty states or their nationals courts rarely find that a

subject to jurisdiction under the waiver exception since it stands in egyptairs shoes id at  here unlike in egyptair the bank was not an instrumentality of a foreign state when it entered into the npa see bradley decl ¶  meyer decl ¶  in sum plaintiffs have cited no case suggesting that a nationalized entity may be found to have waived sovereign immunity because of an agreement entered into by its private sector predecessor at bottom plaintiffs argument is that this court should find that ireland impliedly waived sovereign immunity simply by virtue of having nationalized the bank because the bank as a private entity agreed in the npa to the jurisdiction of new york courts and the application of new york law as noted above however a waiver will not be implied absent strong evidence of the sovereigns intent see human rights in china  wl  at  quoting cargill  fd at  there is no evidence of such an intent here accordingly this court finds that ireland did not waive sovereign immunity when it nationalized the bank iii applicability of the fsias commercial activity exception a statutory background having concluded that the irish government has not waived sovereign immunity for purposes of this action the court must consider whether one or more categories under the fsias commercial activity exception provide a basis for this courts exercise of subject matter jurisdiction the foreign

in the united states by a foreign state means commercial activity carried on by such state and having substantial contact with the united states  usc § e as is plain from the language of    section a

the three categories set forth in the commercial activity exception provide a basis for the exercise of subject matter jurisdiction b alleged commercial activity giving rise to plaintiffs claim the

language of the fsia which speaks to commercial activity of or carried on by a foreign state in the present tense see  usc § a the plain language of the statute does not suggest that congress intended courts to consider — in determining the applicability of the commercial activity exception — activities carried on by a private entity years before it was nationalized in any event in determining the

york bank accounts to the contractors for work that had not yet been performed and without the plaintiffs consent id at  after defendant served default notices on the plaintiff sureties they filed a declaratory judgment action id at    the district court concluded that the defendant and related entities were either a foreign state under the fsia or the alter ego of a foreign state and went on to consider whether the commercial activity exception deprived defendant of immunity id at  the district court ruled that the defendant was not entitled to immunity because both clause  and clause  of the commercial activity exception were applicable as to clause  the court noted that the defendant had negotiated and procured performance bonds in new york and had caused payment of millions of dollars from its new york account that allegedly contributed to the purported defaults which triggered the cosureties duty to pay on those bonds in new york id at  the court concluded that these acts were sufficient under clause  to demonstrate that the plaintiffs action is based on a commercial activity carried on in the united states by defendant id as to clause  the district court noted that defendant did not dispute that its construction project constituted a commercial activity outside the united states and that the changes it allegedly ordered to the project work plans were acts outside the united states id at  defendant argued however that these acts did not cause a direct effect in the united states id in considering the applicability of clause  the district court ruled that plaintiffs were required to demonstrate both that defendants actions caused a direct effect in the united states and that legally significant acts    occurred in the united states id at  in finding a direct effect in the united states the district court noted that defendants declaration of defaults triggered the plaintiffs duty under the bonds    one of those duties is the payment of substantial damages in united states dollars — up to a potential total of over us  million — from their bank accounts in the united states    the payment of such a large sum of money from united states accounts causes a direct effect in the united states id the district court also noted that plaintiffs alleged that the performance bonds were negotiated directly and indirectly by defendants agents in new york    and that defendant made premature and excessive payments not covered by the   bonds from its new york bank account    to the extent that these substantial financial transactions in the united states materially altered the risks to the plaintiffs under the bonds they are legally significant acts    id at  in sum the district court determined that the excessive payments in new york which increased the risk to plaintiffs were legally significant acts but found that it was the potential payment of  million from united states bank accounts that constituted the direct effect in the united states in affirming per curiam the second circuit noted that the plaintiff american sureties alleged and the district court found that defendant made the decision to declare its codefendants in default braspetro  wl  at  the district court also found that the plaintiffs received notice of the default from defendant id at  these acts by or attributable to defendant were taken in connection with its commercial construction projects the acts triggered plaintiffs obligations under the    performance bonds and thus had the direct effect in the united states of giving rise to plaintiffs claims for indemnification the indemnity agreements require payment in the united states are governed by new york law and invoke the jurisdiction of the united states district court for the southern district of new york braspetro  fd at  nothing in braspetro suggests that plaintiffs have demonstrated either a legally significant act in the united states or a direct effect in the united states flowing from the banks alleged overseas merger and sale of assets unlike in braspetro the banks alleged overseas commercial activities have not triggered any obligation or duty on anyones part to do anything in the united states moreover while a breach of contract committed in the united states may constitute a legally significant act for the reasons discussed above the banks anticipated sale of usbased assets does not constitute a breach of the npa and the bank is not in breach of any of its obligations to make payment in new york finally to the extent that the banks postnationalization acts have increased the risk of nonpayment the effects of that increased risk have been felt in the cayman islands — where plaintiffs are based — and not — as in braspetro — in new york in sum there has been no nonpayment here that could support a finding of a direct effect in the united states and plaintiffs have not identified any other effect flowing from the banks overseas
