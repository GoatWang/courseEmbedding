nyeso tumors cmb antigenspecific prime boost primeboost immunooncology agent in vivo t cell activation combines two agents designed to target nyesoexpressing tumors via different mechanisms about cmb cmb is a primeboost approach designed to target tumors that express the nyeso tumor antigen such as soft tissue sarcoma the lead indication we are studying in phase  and  clinical studies nyeso is expressed in a large number of solid and liquid tumors in varying degrees cmb consists of a “prime” called lv from our zvex platform dosed sequentially with a “boost” called from our glaas platform together they are designed to induce a synergistic antitumor cytotoxic t lymphocyte ctl response targeting nyesoexpressing tumors cmb may also generate memory ctls and therefore longterm immune surveillance as well as enhance other immune antitumor mechanisms soft tissue sarcoma opportunity in both our monotherapy single arm phase  and combination randomized phase  studies we are focusing on two types of sarcoma where we believe there is significant unmet need synovial sarcoma and myxoid round cell liposarcoma synovial sarcoma is a cancer in the joints with a fiveyear and tenyear survival for people with grade  tumors or metastatic disease of less than  and  respectively and myxoid round cell liposarcoma is a malignant tumor that most often occurs in the deepseated soft tissues of the extremities currently marketed treatments have high toxicity with up to  of patients experiencing grade  adverse events by comparison to date both cmb and lv have a very favorable safety profile in sarcoma patients we believe cmb’s potential benefit to patients will be the combination of a favorable safety profile with improved survival and as such are focused on overall survival and safety as the primary endpoints of these studies status cmb is currently in several stages of clinical development including a monotherapy phase  trial and a fullyenrolled randomized phase  trial primarilyin patients with two subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma synovial sarcoma or myxoidroundcell liposarcoma in the combination study patients receive either cmb combined with genentech’s cancer immunotherapy tecentriq® atezolizumab antipdl or atezolizumab alone pursuant to a collaboration with genentech at the american society of clinical oncology asco  annual meeting we reported positive clinical and biomarker data for cmb monotherapy in  soft tissue sarcoma sts patients with recurrent disease treated with cmb median overall survival mos had still not yet been reached with an overall survival rate at  and  months of  and  respectively these data compare favorably to mos for approved second line and later sarcoma agents which is only  months as well as a published mos of  months for synovial sarcoma patients specifically the largest patient population enrolled in this trial a disease control rate dcr of   was observed including durable tumor growth arrest in patients who had evidence of disease progression at study entry also cmb was well tolerated and generated a strong and broad antinyeso immune response in  of the patients including evidence of antigen spreading – the induction of an immune response against other tumor antigens not targeted by cmb in addition we presented data showing a statisticallysignificant association of an induced response and clinical benefit in a pooled set of patients treated with cmb or lv the immune biomarkers studied including novel biomarkers derived from public tcrs ptcrs may guide regulatory strategy via the selection of patients more likely to have survival benefit on cmb therapy benchmarks see presentations we have received orphan drug designation in sts for both components of cmb in both the us and eu and for cmb in the us if the ongoing trials produce a sufficiently robust clinical benefit for patients we plan to pursue soft tissue sarcoma as the first indication for which we intend to seek regulatory approval for cmb please

immune activation of the tumor microenvironment designed to leverage endogenous antigens and create a systemic immune response generated from glaas®  discovery platform about g g is immune design’s first product candidate solely generated from the glaas® platform and is designed to leverage the range of endogenous antigens including neoantigens found in the tumor microenvironment to create a systemic antitumor immune response from local injection at its core g consists of glucopyranosyl lipid a gla a potent small synthetic molecule that selectively binds to the tolllike receptor tlr receptor we believe that when g is administered with mechanisms that kill or lyse tumor cells such as radiation it may cause dendritic cells near the lysed tumor to activate and capture the wide range of released endogenous tumor antigens g is designed to trigger a broad immune response against those newlyencountered antigens status g is being studied in a fullyenrolled randomized phase  trial in patients with follicular nonhodgkin lymphoma fl in combination with local radiation and merck’s antipd agent pembrolizumab pursuant to a clinical collaboration with merck at the american society of clinical oncology asco  annual meeting we presented monotherapy data of nine patients who received g with radiation no pembrolizumab that showed  dcr rate with  of the patients achieved a partial response pr based on who criteria which requires at least a  tumor reduction to qualify as a pr in addition  of evaluable patients experienced shrinkage of untreated distal abscopal lesion g was well tolerated with no related grade  aes in all three dose levels tested and tumor biopsies showed increased inflammatory responses and t cell infiltrates in abscopal nontreated tumors see presentations we have received orphan drug designation in follicular fl for g in the us if the ongoing trial in fl patients produces a sufficiently robust clinical benefit for patients we may pursue fl as the first indication for which we intend to seek regulatory approval for g in addition the accessibility of certain tumors makes them ideal for intratumoral dosing and we plan to evaluate the potential of

more preclinical phase  phase  phase  immunooncology pipeline cmb antigenspecific prime boost targeting soft tissue sarcoma and other nyeso tumors cmb antigenspecific prime boost primeboost immunooncology agent in vivo t cell activation combines two agents designed to target nyesoexpressing tumors via different mechanisms about cmb cmb is a primeboost approach designed to target tumors that express the nyeso tumor antigen such as soft tissue sarcoma the lead indication we are studying in phase  and  clinical studies nyeso is expressed in a large number of solid and liquid tumors in varying degrees cmb consists of a “prime” called lv from our zvex platform dosed sequentially with a “boost” called from our glaas platform together they are designed to induce a synergistic antitumor cytotoxic t lymphocyte ctl response targeting nyesoexpressing tumors cmb may also generate memory ctls and therefore longterm immune surveillance as well as enhance other immune antitumor mechanisms soft tissue sarcoma opportunity in both our monotherapy single arm phase  and combination randomized phase  studies we are focusing on two types of sarcoma where we believe there is significant unmet need synovial sarcoma and myxoid round cell liposarcoma synovial sarcoma is a cancer in the joints with a fiveyear and tenyear survival for people with grade  tumors or metastatic disease of less than  and  respectively and myxoid round cell liposarcoma is a malignant tumor that most often occurs in the deepseated soft tissues of the extremities currently marketed treatments have high toxicity with up to  of patients experiencing grade  adverse events by comparison to date both cmb and lv have a very favorable safety profile in sarcoma patients we believe cmb’s potential benefit to patients will be the combination of a favorable safety profile with improved survival and as such are focused on overall survival and safety as the primary endpoints of these studies status cmb is currently in several stages of clinical development including a monotherapy phase  trial and a fullyenrolled randomized phase  trial primarilyin patients with two subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma synovial sarcoma or myxoidroundcell liposarcoma in the combination study patients receive either cmb combined with genentech’s cancer immunotherapy tecentriq® atezolizumab antipdl or atezolizumab alone pursuant to a collaboration with genentech at the american society of clinical oncology asco  annual meeting we reported positive clinical and biomarker data for cmb monotherapy in  soft tissue sarcoma sts patients with recurrent disease treated with cmb median overall survival mos had still not yet been reached with an overall survival rate at  and  months of  and  respectively these data compare favorably to mos for approved second line and later sarcoma agents which is only  months as well as a published mos of  months for synovial sarcoma patients specifically the largest patient population enrolled in this trial a disease control rate dcr of   was observed including durable tumor growth arrest in patients who had evidence of disease progression at study entry also cmb was well tolerated and generated a strong and broad antinyeso immune response in  of the patients including evidence of antigen spreading – the induction of an immune response against other tumor antigens not targeted by cmb in addition we presented data showing a statisticallysignificant association of an induced response and clinical benefit in a pooled set of patients treated with cmb or lv the immune biomarkers studied including novel biomarkers derived from public tcrs ptcrs may guide regulatory strategy via the selection of patients more likely to have survival benefit on cmb therapy benchmarks see presentations we have received orphan drug designation in sts for both components of cmb in both the us and eu and for cmb in the us if the ongoing trials produce a sufficiently robust clinical benefit for patients we plan to pursue soft tissue sarcoma as the first indication for which we intend to seek regulatory approval for cmb please check the clinical trials page for more information g potent intratumoral tlr agonism leverages endogenous  neo antigens follicular nonhodgkin’s lymphoma g potent intratumoral tlr agonism intratumoral immune activation of the tumor microenvironment designed to leverage endogenous antigens and create a systemic immune response generated from glaas®  discovery platform about g g is immune design’s first product candidate solely generated from the glaas® platform and is designed to leverage the range of endogenous antigens including neoantigens found in the tumor microenvironment to create a systemic antitumor immune response from local injection at its core g consists of glucopyranosyl lipid a gla a potent small synthetic molecule that selectively binds to the tolllike receptor tlr receptor we believe that when g is administered with mechanisms that kill or lyse tumor cells such as radiation it may cause dendritic cells near the lysed tumor to activate and capture the wide range of released endogenous tumor antigens g is designed to trigger a broad immune response against those newlyencountered antigens status g is being studied in a fullyenrolled randomized phase  trial in patients with follicular nonhodgkin lymphoma fl in combination with local radiation and merck’s antipd agent pembrolizumab pursuant to a clinical collaboration with merck at the american society of clinical oncology asco  annual meeting we presented monotherapy data of nine patients who received g with radiation no pembrolizumab that showed  dcr rate with  of the patients achieved a partial response pr based on who criteria which requires at least a  tumor reduction to qualify as a pr in addition  of evaluable patients experienced shrinkage of untreated distal abscopal lesion g was well tolerated with no related grade  aes in all three dose levels tested and tumor biopsies showed increased inflammatory responses and t cell infiltrates in abscopal nontreated tumors see presentations we have received orphan drug designation in follicular fl for g in the us if the ongoing trial in fl patients produces a sufficiently robust clinical benefit for patients we may pursue fl as the first indication for which we intend to seek regulatory approval for g in addition the accessibility of certain tumors makes them ideal for intratumoral dosing and we plan to evaluate the potential of additional clinical studies in other tumors

toggle navigation harnessing the immune system to fight disease aboutimmune design we are a clinicalstage immunotherapy company with nextgeneration in vivo approaches designed to enable the body’s immune system to fight disease although we believe our approaches have broad potential across multiple therapeutic areas we are focused in oncology and have engineered our technologies to activate the immune system’s natural ability to create tumorspecific cytotoxic t cells or ctls to fight cancer our two primary product candidates cmb and g utilize distinct immunooncology approaches that we believe address the shortcomings of existing therapies and have the potential to treat a broad patient population either as individual therapies or in combination with other mechanisms of action our immunooncology product candidates are being developed in two separate approaches one that targets specific antigens andor epitopes such as cmb and in our neoantigen collaboration and an alternative approach that leverages the endogenous antigens found in the tumor microenvironment via intratumoral immunization such as g the specific antigen approach uses selected antigens that are also present in the patient’s tumor so that the immune system will be educated to recognize the tumor antigen and kill tumor cells expressing the antigen the intratumoral immunization approach in contrast does not require preidentifying a selected antigen present in the tumor it instead relies on treatments such as chemotherapy or local radiation to lyse tumors and release endogenous antigens which are then captured by neighboring gactivated dendritic cells and is intended to generate a broad and varied immune response although they have distinct mechanisms of action we designed both cmb and g to convert “cold” tumors or those without ctls to “hot” tumors or those with ctls specific for the antigens expressed by the tumor while our primary focus is immunooncology we believe that our platforms also have therapeutic potential in infectious and allergic diseases and have multiple collaborations in place with global pharmaceutical companies leveraging the glaas platform we look to our partnerships
