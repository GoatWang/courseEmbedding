events chris and harris pappas the restaurant business proved a successful enterprise indeed for jim pappas and his father hd who came to america from greece in  but when the next generation came along young chris and harris were encouraged to avoid the restaurant industry and given warnings about its long hours and unpredictable schedules the brothers managed to stay away – for a little while harris earned a finance degree from texas am university and served as a nd lieutenant in the us army chris received a degree in engineering from the university of texas and took a job at ibm computers but the lure of the restaurant biz proved too strong for both brothers soon harris found himself managing his father jims first restaurant the dot coffee shop only to be followed shortly by chris who

are few more recognizable names in houston than the pappas family weve all eaten at one of their restaurants pappas barbq for smoked meats pappadeaux for seafood and pappasitos for texmex just to name a few the pappas empire has grown from two restaurants in downtown houston in  to more than  restaurants in eight states today few houstonians know the story behind the family that has expanded pappas restaurants into one of the countrys largest familyowned restaurant chains it starts in  when hd pappas immigrated to america from greece he settled in dallas and raised four sons  jim pete tom and george the sons moved to houston in the s to start a successful refrigeration business  a growth industry at the time to say the least in addition to refrigeration equipment the brothers started selling other equipment to local restaurants they slowly started to get into the restaurant business themselves by the s they were concentrating on two of their restaurants in downtown houston both on pierce street the dot coffee shop where the metro station is now and the brisket house where a pappas barbq still is translator to read this article in one of houstons mostspoken languages click on

restaurant violations july  ihop offering cent pancakes tuesday around that time jims sons returned to houston  harris from the army and chris from college though the family business was successful the two wanted to strike out on their own harris took a job at the lubys cafeteria chain chris sold bibles doortodoor and later took a job at a dennys restaurant it was during this time that harris and chris learned every aspect of the restaurant business from dish washing to cooking to serving and management in  they took over daytoday management of the family restaurants and laid the foundation for the business it is today greg pappas another brother involved in the family business died in a car accident in  harris and chris still are directly involved in daytoday operation of pappas restaurants but over the past few years their children have taken on more prominent roles they live in a world where nothing is ever good enough nothing is ever completed says christina pappas referring to standards set by her father harris and uncle chris like a lot of heirs to texas food empires the sense of responsibility and pressure to continue the success of the family business is palpable but the new generation of pappas family restaurateurs seems to take it in stride six pappas children all in their s and s are involved in daytoday operations christina handles marketing and guest relations while her sister mary handles restaurant operations another sister evy is an architect and oversees restaurant construction brother hd manages real estate interests and younger brother tom just joined the business and is working at their newest concept pappas meat co chris daughter georgea heads up culinary research and development mary literally grew up in the family business  at the time her dad and uncle took over the downtown restaurants they were living in the  main apartment tower across the street my dad told all the employees he lived there so he could watch them all the time mary said after college mary started as a manager at a pappadeaux location not long after that pappas acquired the luthers barbq chain and mary oversaw its merger with pappas although her background is in barbecue mary now oversees business operations for all pappas restaurants mary is quick to point out that pappas still is a familyowned business investors and shareholders arent a factor in decision making thats critical in the cyclical nature of the restaurant business whereas some chains will lay off employees and switch to lower quality ingredients to keep profits up during tough times pappas has the resources and the independence to ride out the slumps many employees work for pappas their whole lives and two of the original employees hired by chris and harris pappas still are involved with the company though there is a fasttrack program for college graduates to become managers almost all of their restaurant managers started as servers or cooks and all managers are promoted from within the company it all makes for consistency in management in a large restaurant chain the new generation of the pappas family is fully aware of the vagaries of the restaurant business and the brutal competition they are sure to encounter in the future we like competition christina said it keeps us on our toes jc reid columnist houston chronicle business texas oil fields
