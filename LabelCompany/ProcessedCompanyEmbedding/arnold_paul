0 no comments conceptual drawings  family orientated kitchen utensil this was work i produced for a first year project in which i had to propose an incremental redesign for an existing product on the market the product i eventually designed was a family orientated potato ricer that is aimed for the use of children between the ages of  and 0 to use with their parents i came up with the idea as a response to the market research and analysis i had studied about the market trends and also the growing public awareness of healthy eating and also healthy eating in school in terms of the design considerations that were made i chose to use images of frogs and aliens as inspiration for the design as can be seen from the conceptual drawings the idea of the project was to make the product appealing to my chosen target audience also to use design as a way of involving children in the kitchen and creating an interest that reflects various healthy eating campaigns including those
