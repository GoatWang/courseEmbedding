limitations as an analytical tool and this measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under gaap as the excluded items may have significant effects on our operating results and financial condition additionally our measure of adjusted ebitda may differ from other companies measure of adjusted ebitda when evaluating our performance adjusted ebitda should be considered with other financial performance measures including various cash flow metrics net income and other gaap results in the future we may disclose different

therapies that combine omegas and cannabinoids poised to enter billion dollar markets if you think you haven’t had cannabinoids because you’ve never used cannabis you are completely mistaken you may not have ‘touched’ plantderived cannabinoids phytocannabinoids but it would have been biologically impossible to escape the ones produced by your body endocannabinoids endocannabinoids play an essential mediating role in a number of human physiologic systems they promote a goldilocks internal environment a mean between excess and deficiency in a variety of functions and areas and recent scholarship has shown that their production is enhanced and fostered by fatty acids the kind used by algae dynamics corp otcqb adynf as a result adynf has begun to develop fortified formulas of omegas and cannabis oil that may boost the functioning of the human endocannabinoid system discovery of what is now known as the endocannabinoid system has a peculiar history it is perhaps the only known human physiologic system that is named after a plant and that’s all because of chronology a number of substances isolated from the cannabis plant were later found to be produced by the human body first identification and isolation of the two major cannabinoids deltatetrahydrocannabinol thc and cannabidiol cbd is attributed to raphael mechoulam and his colleague y gaoni in israel in  mechoulam whose discovery and further research into cannabis has earned him the moniker ‘father of cannabis’ was also part of a team that in  discovered the endocannabinoid system this physiologic system plays a vital role in maintaining human health endocannabinoids and their receptors permeate the human body they can be found in the brain in various organs in connective tissue in glands and in immune cells their main function appears to be stabilizing our internal environment freeing it from the dangerous volatility of the external world currently the two best understood endocannabinoids are anandamide and arachidonoylglycerol ag studies of which have uncovered a number of medical benefits they may have anandamide for example inhibits the proliferation of breast cancer cells and appears to retard the memory decline associated with alzheimer’s disease these encouraging findings suggest that phytocannabinoids offer a ‘natural’ way to treat a variety of ailments including multiple sclerosis ms arthritis hypertension memory loss pediatric epilepsy and neuropathic pain research into cannabis and development of therapeutic products goes on in canada as legalization looms industry professionals are divided on whether there should be a legal distinction between medical and recreational cannabis a recent article on cbc news health reports comments by two researchers who believe that medicinal and recreational cannabis should be separate httpdtnfmaxdi they argue that a dualstream approach would decrease the stigma associated with cannabis use for medicinal purposes since for example it would be sold at a pharmacy rather than a general retailer dualstream would also protect ‘the supply of strains of medical cannabis that have desirable effects for patients such as lower thc strains sometimes used to treat children who suffer from seizures’ and also increase clinical research into the therapeutic benefits of cannabis the products under development by algae dynamics promise to pack a powerful therapeutic punch combining the virtues of omegas and cannabinoids algae dynamics’ algae oil is high in omegas dhadpa which is in demand by the growing multibillion dollar
