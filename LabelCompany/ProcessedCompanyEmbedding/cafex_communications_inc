and promotion of its products and services branded with the chime™ trademarks those marks have acquired significant value and recognition in the united states  the chime™ trademarks are wellknown to the consuming public and trade as identifying and distinguishing plaintiff cafex exclusively and uniquely as the source and origin of the high quality goods and services to which they are applied defendant’s illegal conduct  last week on february   defendant aws announced a new communications and collaboration software service for businesses that competes directly with cafex’s chime product and service  aws could have named its new product and service practically anything it chose however to blatantly infringe the chime trademarks marketing its product and service under the marks “chime” and “amazon chime” the “infringing trademarks”  aws was aware of cafex’s chime product and service as well as the chime trademarks before it launched its competing and infringing product and service  not only is it essentially impossible for aws to have been ignorant of cafex’s chime product and service before launching its competing product and service in light of industry acclaim received by cafex for its chime product and service over the past year but an aws employee with the title principal product manager visited cafex’s  enterprise connect’s booth where cafex’s chime product and service was being heavily promoted under the chime trademarks case cvvm document  filed  page  of   aws’s marketing for its new product and service touts similar functionality for the same target customers as cafex’s chime product and service see httpdocsawsamazoncomchimelatestugwhat ischimehtml “amazon chime is a secure realtime unified communications service that transforms meetings by making them more efficient and easier to conduct” httpschimeaws “you can use amazon chime for online meetings video conferencing calls chat and to share content both inside and outside your organization… meetings call you an d with a single tap or click you can join or notify participants that you’re running late… you don’t need to switch between applications to collaborate instantly go from a chat to a call share your screen and even invite more people with a simple cli ck or tap all in the same application”  amazon also uses the following logo form of its infringing trademarks see httpschimeaws  the acts of defendant in advertising offering for sale and selling in interstate commerce goods and services branded with the infringing trademarks are a likely to cause confusion and mistake among the consuming public that such goods and services originate with plaintiff b likely to cause confusion and mistake among the consuming public that there is some affiliation connection or association between defendant and plaintiff and c likely to cause confusion and mistake among the consuming public that such goods and services are being offered to the consuming public with the sp onsorship or approval of plaintiff  not only is aws’s infringing chime product and service likely to cause confusion but there have already been multiple instances of confusion since aws’s public launch of its product and service last week as a result o f aws’s infringement cafex has case cvvm document  filed  page  of  received numerous communications from confused third parties including queries regarding whether amazon’s product uses cafex’s chime technology and annoyed business partners confused into believing incorrectly that cafex chose to partner with aws rather than with them to market and sell cafex’s chime product and service  aws has signed up to be an exhibitor at the  enterprise connect trade show where it is planning to promote its infringing chime product and service  aws’s booth at the  enterprise connect show is only two booths away from where cafex’s booth will be  thus in a matter of weeks at the industry’s most significant trade show of the year the same trade show where one year ago cafex won best of enterprise connect for its chimebranded technology and where thousands of potential customers and business partners will be in attendance aws will be promoting its competing and infringing chimebranded technology just  feet away from where cafex will be promoting its chimebranded technology to the same potential customers and partners causing great damage and irreparable harm to cafex  furthermore aws is scheduled to give a keynote address at the  enterprise connect show aws’s address will be livestreamed over the internet allowing anyone in the world to watch it live aws is expected to promote its infringing chime technology via its keynote address providing it with massive marketing coverage under the infringing trademarks  defendant’s willful infringement is likely to cause confusion and mistake among the consuming public as to the source affiliation andor sponsorship of defendant’s goods and services and will improperly and unfairly provide defendant with the benefit of the goodwill associated with the cafex chime™ trademarks case cvvm document  filed  page  of   in addition aws is a far larger and more renown company than cafex aws reportedly had over  billion in sales and  billion in profit in  if aws is permitted to use the infringing trademarks at the upcoming enterprise connect trade show and otherwise continue to market its products and services under the infringing trademarks aws will be able to saturate the market overwhelming cafex and its chime trademarks as a result the public will come to assume incorrectly that cafex’s chimebranded products and services are really aws’s or that cafex’s chimebranded products and services are somehow connected to aws cafex will thereby lose control over its goodwill and reputation its identity and the value of its chime trademarks to cafex’s great and irreparable harm first claim for relief federal false designation of origin false advertising and
