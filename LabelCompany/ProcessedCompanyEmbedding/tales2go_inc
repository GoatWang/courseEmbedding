the app does not save your spot in the book if the app is closed there is an option to place a bookmark but if the device is accidentally shut off or if the battery dies or if you forget to remove the last book mark and place a new one your spot in the story is lost plus every time you open the app you have to find your story and then find your place it doesnt even have a currently playing section
