was noticed by actor sir michael redgrave who used his connections to introduce boyd to the director of the windsor repertory group boyds first role which brought him acclaim was as an irish spy in the movie the man who never was based on the book by ewen montagu the movie was released in april  shortly thereafter he signed a ten year contract with th century fox studios  who began prepping him

leading man in her next movie after her success in roger vadims and god created woman and she chose boyd from august to october of   bardot boyd and alida valli filmed the lusty romance the night heaven fell directed by roger vadim in paris and in the region of málaga spain specifically the small whitewashed town of mijas  being in the bardot spotlight added much to boyds film credit in addition to bringing him notice in hollywood stephen boyd finally arrived in hollywood in january of  to take on first true hollywood role as a renegade cowboy in the fox western the bravados which starred gregory peck and joan collins even though this was a hollywood production the actually filming took place in morelia mexico  after the filming of the bravados was complete in late march of  stephen boyd returned to hollywood to audition for the coveted role of messala in mgms upcoming epic benhur many other actors including victor mature kirk douglas leslie nielsen and stewart granger had been considered for the part  but stephen boyds screen test convinced director william wyler that he had found the perfect villain for his epic along with wylers admiration for boyds performance in the man who never was from the previous year boyd was hurried off to join actor charlton heston in rome in may of  to learn the chariot racing aspect of his role heston had already been practicing behind the chariot for weeks so boyd needed to learn the sport quickly boyd was also required to wear brown contact lenses as messala which irritated his eyes and caused vision problems for a few

an international star overnight his portrayal of the roman tribune messala brought in rave reviews press columnist erskine johnson wrote a brass hat and the armor of a roman warrior in benhur does for stephen boyd what a tight dress does for marilyn monroe ruth waterbury in her boyd feature in the pittsburgh post gazette would describe boyds character as the dangerously masculine and quite magnificent messala modern screen magazine in  stated that boyds ruthless messala had lost the chariot race but captured the sympathy and sex appeal of benhur he was featured in the popular tv program this is your life on  february  a show which featured many of boyds family members and acquaintances including michael redgrave telling stories about his early life and film career this should be some indication of how stephen boyd fever was catching newspaper columnists were getting swarmed with letters from female fans of all ages wanting to know more about boyd he was being sent dozens of starring roles which most he had to turn down due to other obligations or he himself turned down he opted out of the biblical epic the story of ruth which didnt please fox studios and he was one of

los angeles california throughout  boyd continued to make films in europe traveling to yugoslavia to star as the villain jamuga in the epic genghis khan boyd was the top billed and therefore the top

boyd starred in another story about racial tension this time a world war ii madefortelevision drama called carters army or black brigade which aired in august  featuring a young richard pryor during this time or earlier is when boyd began his interest in l ron hubbards church of scientology which would make him one of the first hollywood stars to be involved in it boyd had always expressed an interest in esoteric religions in an interview in august  with the detroit free press he said that scientology helped him through the filming of slaves and that it is a process used to make you capable of learning scientology is nothing it means only what you want it to it is not a church you go to to pray but a church that you go to to learn it is no good unless you apply it it is the application boyd apparently had been elevated to a scientology status of oc  a position beneath that of clear boyd would actually go on to star and narrate a scientology recruiting film called freedom in  a copy of this film can be found at the library of congress but it is not available online via any scientology resource which may indicate a falling out boyd had with scientology using his name for recruiting purposes there is no documentation of his later involvement with it during the s demand for boyd in hollywood had diminished so he focused his attention on european films and several television pilots and shows he made three films in spain with director josé antonio nieves conde including marta in  the great swindle in  and casa manchada in  he worked with cult director romain gary in the drug thriller kill in  he also made several westerns including hannie caulder with raquel welch in  the man called noon in  those dirty dogs in  and potato fritz in  he also kept travelling to exotics destinations to act including australia for the hands of cormac joyce in  south africa for control factor and the manipulator in  jamaica for the scuba diving adventure the treasure of jamaica reef in  florida for the television pilot key west in  and hawaii in his last acting stint as a guest star on the popular television show hawaii fiveo in  the episode up the rebels was the premiere episode of hawaii fiveos tenth season and it aired after boyds death on  september  his most critically acclaimed role during the s was as a colourful irish gangster in the uk crime thriller the squeeze in  a letter from film producer euan lloyd who produced such films as shalako the man called noon and the wild geese states that stephen boyd was one of the nicest kindest people i have met in my lifetime rare in this profession although boyd spent most of his adult life traveling abroad for film work he made his permanent home in southern california at one point in the s he had three homes there— one above the sunset strip one in tarzana and another in palm springs where he enjoyed his favorite pastime golf he would make frequent trips back to his hometown of belfast in northern ireland to visit his family on one particular visit to belfast in  boyd exclaimed his dismay about the situation in northern ireland at that time because of the divisiveness the potential for displaying to the world all that is good in that lovely land is lost perhaps even destroyed boyd was valued so highly by his native city of belfast that during his visits he was always given a military escort from the airport to his home for security reasons deathedit boyd died of a massive heart attack on  june  at the age of  while playing golf with his wife elizabeth mills at the porter valley country club in northridge california stephen and elizabeth were in a golf cart between the fifth and sixth tees when suddenly he said i dont feel well and slumped over elizabeth dragged him out of the cart and gave him artificial respiration but it was too late  he was in talks to play the role of the regimental sergeant major in euan lloyds the wild geese before his death boyd was interred in oakwood memorial park cemetery in chatsworth california his wife elizabeth mills boyd was interred with him at the time of her death in  personal lifeedit silver screen magazine in  wrote this about boyd a supreme individualist like most irishman he has a wonderful actors face that easily switches from an engaging smile to sinister menace far handsomer in person than on the screen  stephen boyd is a lean  pounds well built sixfootone charmer of  with a dazzling dimple light brown curly hair fair skin and the kind of grey eyes which take on color from what he is wearing a man of tremendous vitality moody and volatile a typical celt he veers from humor to anger in the wink of an eye he dresses conservatively speaks wittily and extremely well though he confesses that hes had almost no formal schooling is genial and friendly i have my brooding hours which wipe that grin off my face boyd was first married in  to italianborn mca executive mariella di sarzana during the filming of benhur they separated after just three weeks concerning his shortlived marriage to sarzana boyd would explain it was my fault im an irish soandso when im working i hadnt been married a week when we both knew we had made a mistake she is a nice girl but we were just not meant for each other i suppose i wasnt ready for marriage maybe i was still too much of an adolescent  they officially divorced in early  boyd lived as a bachelor for most of his life and was wary of marriage after his first experience his secretary elizabeth mills was a permanent resident at his tarzana home during these years though the two did not marry until  he was very popular with the hollywood columnists including his friend hedda hopper and her rival louella parsons due to his honest open comments and sense of humor he dated some very prominent women in hollywood including anna kashfi marlon brandos ex belfast socialite romney tree actress joan collins tv star and playboy centerfold marilyn hanold and israeli actress elena eden hollywood columnists would also make note of boyds flirtation with hope lange hope lange would later say in a vanity fair interview about the best of everything during the film we had a great camaraderie he had that wonderful irish charm and wonderful humour and anyone who has humor im a sucker for boyd was rumored to have been a romantic interest of doris day during the filming of jumbo which boyd vehemently denied boyd seems to have been much enamored of his costar sophia loren during the filming of the epic the fall of the roman empire boyd said during an interview in  that i wouldnt die exactly for sophia but id come close to it he would also comment in an interview in  that sophia was the most beautiful person ive ever met raquel welch would claim in  that during the filming of fantastic voyage in  she became infatuated with boyd who rejected her advances in her comments she would imply that boyd was gay no evidence of stephen boyd being a homosexual exists however he possibly did play his most famous character messala in benhur with a homosexual twist as instructed by screenwriter gore vidal in gore vidals autobiography palimpsest

frequent trips back to his hometown of belfast in northern ireland to visit his family on one particular visit to belfast in  boyd exclaimed his dismay about the situation in northern ireland at that

lifeedit silver screen magazine in  wrote this about boyd a supreme individualist like most irishman he has a wonderful actors face that easily switches from an engaging smile to sinister menace far handsomer in person than on the screen  stephen boyd is a lean  pounds well built sixfootone charmer of  with a dazzling dimple light brown curly hair fair skin and the kind of grey eyes which take on color from what he is wearing a man of tremendous vitality moody and volatile a typical celt he veers from humor to anger in the wink of an eye he dresses conservatively speaks wittily and extremely well though he confesses that hes had almost no formal schooling is genial and friendly i have my brooding hours which wipe that grin off my face boyd was first married in  to italianborn mca executive mariella di sarzana during the filming of benhur they separated after just three weeks concerning his shortlived marriage to sarzana boyd would explain it was my fault im an irish soandso when im working i hadnt been married a week when we both knew we had made a mistake she is a nice girl but we were just not meant for each other i suppose i wasnt ready for marriage maybe i was still

person ive ever met raquel welch would claim in  that during the filming of fantastic voyage in  she became infatuated with boyd who rejected her advances in her comments she would imply that boyd was gay no evidence of stephen boyd being a homosexual exists however he possibly did play his most famous character messala in benhur with a homosexual twist as instructed by screenwriter gore vidal in gore vidals autobiography palimpsest  vidal describes his discussion with boyd concerning the character messalas underlying motivation this was based on an idea by vidal to enhance the tension between

or heston believed that a homoerotic undertone existed in benhur  boyd had a deep and lasting friendship with actress and french icon brigitte bardot boyd starred in two movies with bardot — the night

frequent trips back to his hometown of belfast in northern ireland to visit his family on one particular visit to belfast in  boyd exclaimed his dismay about the situation in northern ireland at that

handsomer in person than on the screen  stephen boyd is a lean  pounds well built sixfootone charmer of  with a dazzling dimple light brown curly hair fair skin and the kind of grey eyes which take on color from what he is wearing a man of tremendous vitality moody and volatile a typical celt he veers from humor to anger in the wink of an eye he dresses conservatively speaks wittily and extremely

gay no evidence of stephen boyd being a homosexual exists however he possibly did play his most famous character messala in benhur with a homosexual twist as instructed by screenwriter gore vidal in gore vidals autobiography palimpsest  vidal describes his discussion with boyd concerning the character messalas underlying motivation this was based on an idea by vidal to enhance the tension between

or heston believed that a homoerotic undertone existed in benhur  boyd had a deep and lasting friendship with actress and french icon brigitte bardot boyd starred in two movies with bardot — the night

filming of slaves and that it is a process used to make you capable of learning scientology is nothing it means only what you want it to it is not a church you go to to pray but a church that you go

frequent trips back to his hometown of belfast in northern ireland to visit his family on one particular visit to belfast in  boyd exclaimed his dismay about the situation in northern ireland at that time because of the divisiveness the potential for displaying to the world all that is good in that lovely land is lost perhaps even destroyed boyd was valued so highly by his native city of belfast

lifeedit silver screen magazine in  wrote this about boyd a supreme individualist like most irishman he has a wonderful actors face that easily switches from an engaging smile to sinister menace far handsomer in person than on the screen  stephen boyd is a lean  pounds well built sixfootone charmer of  with a dazzling dimple light brown curly hair fair skin and the kind of grey eyes which take on color from what he is wearing a man of tremendous vitality moody and volatile a typical celt he veers from humor to anger in the wink of an eye he dresses conservatively speaks wittily and extremely well though he confesses that hes had almost no formal schooling is genial and friendly i have my brooding hours which wipe that grin off my face boyd was first married in  to italianborn mca executive mariella di sarzana during the filming of benhur they separated after just three weeks concerning his shortlived marriage to sarzana boyd would explain it was my fault im an irish soandso when im working i hadnt been married a week when we both knew we had made a mistake she is a nice girl but we were just not meant for each other i suppose i wasnt ready for marriage maybe i was still too much of an adolescent  they officially divorced in early  boyd lived as a bachelor for most of his life and was wary of marriage after his first experience his secretary elizabeth mills was a permanent resident at his tarzana home during these years though the two did not marry until  he was very popular with the hollywood columnists including his friend hedda hopper and her rival louella

have been a romantic interest of doris day during the filming of jumbo which boyd vehemently denied boyd seems to have been much enamored of his costar sophia loren during the filming of the epic the fall of the roman empire boyd said during an interview in  that i wouldnt die exactly for sophia but id come close to it he would also comment in an interview in  that sophia was the most beautiful person ive ever met raquel welch would claim in  that during the filming of fantastic voyage in  she became infatuated with boyd who rejected her advances in her comments she would imply that boyd was gay no evidence of stephen boyd being a homosexual exists however he possibly did play his most famous character messala in benhur with a homosexual twist as instructed by screenwriter gore vidal in gore vidals autobiography palimpsest  vidal describes his discussion with boyd concerning the character messalas underlying motivation this was based on an idea by vidal to enhance the tension between the two main antagonists  vidal would subsequently argue years later with director william wyler and actor charlton heston about boyds performance and the implications surrounding benhur neither wyler or heston believed that a homoerotic undertone existed in benhur  boyd had a deep and lasting friendship with actress and french icon brigitte bardot boyd starred in two movies with bardot — the night heaven fell in  and shalako in  during the filming of shalako in almeria spain bardot and boyds close relationship and open affection for each other sparked numerous rumors of a possible affair  it

in an interview with photoplay film in  boyd said bardot is always bardot shes marvelous shes an enormous star and shes a unique marvelous woman i adore her  hart and boyd in  boyd also had a close relationship with actress dolores hart hart describes what would be her only romance with a costar in her autobiography the ear of the heart boyd eventually rejected her advances but they remained close friends even after she turned to the cloistered life of a nun in  he visited her in  at the abbey of regina laudis in connecticut and remained in communication with her up until the early s stephen boyd’s most passionate affair seems to have been with beautiful austrian actress marisa mell they met while filming the movie marta in  boyd initially dodged marisa mells amorous advances but during the second film they made together the great swindle the two became inseparable lovers they married in a gypsy camp on the outskirts of madrid in late  the ceremony included a wrist cutting exchange of blood to seal their bond the marriage was not considered legal but marisa mell said who cares in our minds it will be real according to marisa mell their affair was so intense that while living in rome they made a trip to the italian town of sarsina for a ritual exorcism at the cathedral of st vicinius a short time later boyd became physically ill over the intensity of the affair and abruptly left rome to return first to belfast then onto jamaica to begin filming the treasure of jamaica reef in early  boyds last marriage took place in  to elizabeth mills a secretary at the british

filming of slaves and that it is a process used to make you capable of learning scientology is nothing it means only what you want it to it is not a church you go to to pray but a church that you go

frequent trips back to his hometown of belfast in northern ireland to visit his family on one particular visit to belfast in  boyd exclaimed his dismay about the situation in northern ireland at that time because of the divisiveness the potential for displaying to the world all that is good in that lovely land is lost perhaps even destroyed boyd was valued so highly by his native city of belfast

lifeedit silver screen magazine in  wrote this about boyd a supreme individualist like most irishman he has a wonderful actors face that easily switches from an engaging smile to sinister menace far handsomer in person than on the screen  stephen boyd is a lean  pounds well built sixfootone charmer of  with a dazzling dimple light brown curly hair fair skin and the kind of grey eyes which take on color from what he is wearing a man of tremendous vitality moody and volatile a typical celt he veers from humor to anger in the wink of an eye he dresses conservatively speaks wittily and extremely well though he confesses that hes had almost no formal schooling is genial and friendly i have my brooding hours which wipe that grin off my face boyd was first married in  to italianborn mca executive mariella di sarzana during the filming of benhur they separated after just three weeks concerning his shortlived marriage to sarzana boyd would explain it was my fault im an irish soandso when im working i hadnt been married a week when we both knew we had made a mistake she is a nice girl but we were just not meant for each other i suppose i wasnt ready for marriage maybe i was still too much of an adolescent  they officially divorced in early  boyd lived as a bachelor for most of his life and was wary of marriage after his first experience his secretary elizabeth mills was a permanent resident at his tarzana home during these years though the two did not marry until  he was very popular with the hollywood columnists including his friend hedda hopper and her rival louella

have been a romantic interest of doris day during the filming of jumbo which boyd vehemently denied boyd seems to have been much enamored of his costar sophia loren during the filming of the epic the fall of the roman empire boyd said during an interview in  that i wouldnt die exactly for sophia but id come close to it he would also comment in an interview in  that sophia was the most beautiful person ive ever met raquel welch would claim in  that during the filming of fantastic voyage in  she became infatuated with boyd who rejected her advances in her comments she would imply that boyd was gay no evidence of stephen boyd being a homosexual exists however he possibly did play his most famous character messala in benhur with a homosexual twist as instructed by screenwriter gore vidal in gore vidals autobiography palimpsest  vidal describes his discussion with boyd concerning the character messalas underlying motivation this was based on an idea by vidal to enhance the tension between the two main antagonists  vidal would subsequently argue years later with director william wyler and actor charlton heston about boyds performance and the implications surrounding benhur neither wyler or heston believed that a homoerotic undertone existed in benhur  boyd had a deep and lasting friendship with actress and french icon brigitte bardot boyd starred in two movies with bardot — the night heaven fell in  and shalako in  during the filming of shalako in almeria spain bardot and boyds close relationship and open affection for each other sparked numerous rumors of a possible affair  it

in an interview with photoplay film in  boyd said bardot is always bardot shes marvelous shes an enormous star and shes a unique marvelous woman i adore her  hart and boyd in  boyd also had a close relationship with actress dolores hart hart describes what would be her only romance with a costar in her autobiography the ear of the heart boyd eventually rejected her advances but they remained close friends even after she turned to the cloistered life of a nun in  he visited her in  at the abbey of regina laudis in connecticut and remained in communication with her up until the early s stephen boyd’s most passionate affair seems to have been with beautiful austrian actress marisa mell they met while filming the movie marta in  boyd initially dodged marisa mells amorous advances but during the second film they made together the great swindle the two became inseparable lovers they married in a gypsy camp on the outskirts of madrid in late  the ceremony included a wrist cutting exchange of blood to seal their bond the marriage was not considered legal but marisa mell said who cares in our minds it will be real according to marisa mell their affair was so intense that while living in rome they made a trip to the italian town of sarsina for a ritual exorcism at the cathedral of st vicinius a short time later boyd became physically ill over the intensity of the affair and abruptly left rome to return first to belfast then onto jamaica to begin filming the treasure of jamaica reef in early  boyds last marriage took place in  to elizabeth mills a secretary at the british
