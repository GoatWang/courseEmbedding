issue summary full text save share comment text size print pdf  buy copies view more from the june  issue explore the archive executive summary why is it so hard to build and maintain the capacity to innovate the reason is not simply a failure to execute but a failure to articulate an innovation strategy that aligns innovation efforts with the overall business strategy without such a strategy companies will have a hard time weighing the tradeoffs of various practices—such as crowdsourcing and customer cocreation—and so may end up with a grab bag of approaches they will have trouble designing a coherent innovation system that fits their competitive needs over time and may be tempted to ape someone else’s system and they will find it difficult to align different parts of the organization with shared priorities as corning a leader in glass and materials science has found an innovation strategy must address how innovation will create value for potential customers how the company will capture a share of that value and what types of innovation to pursue critics tend to discount “routine” innovation that leverages a company’s existing technical capabilities and business model and extol “disruptive” innovation but that is a simplistic view a company’s unique competitive circumstances should dictate the innovation portfolio it pursues because innovation cuts across functions only senior leaders can set an innovation strategy in doing so they must recognize that the strategy like the process of innovation itself requires continual experimentation and adaptation hbr reprint rb idea in brief the problem innovation remains a frustrating pursuit failure rates are high and even successful companies can’t sustain their performance the root cause is that companies fall into the trap of adopting whatever best practices are in vogue or aping the exemplar innovator of the moment the solution managers should articulate an innovation strategy that stipulates how their firm’s innovation efforts will support the overall business strategy this will help them make tradeoff decisions so that they can choose the most appropriate practices and set overarching innovation priorities that align all functions the steps creating an innovation strategy involves determining how innovation will create value for potential customers how the company will capture that value and which types of innovation to pursue just as product designs must evolve to stay competitive so must innovation strategies as the environment changes despite massive investments of management time and money innovation remains a frustrating pursuit in many companies innovation initiatives frequently fail and successful innovators have a hard time sustaining their performance—as polaroid nokia sun microsystems yahoo hewlettpackard and countless others have found why is it so hard to build and maintain the capacity to innovate the reasons go much deeper than the commonly cited cause a failure to execute the problem with innovation improvement efforts is rooted in the lack of an innovation strategy a strategy is nothing more than a commitment to a set of coherent mutually reinforcing policies or behaviors aimed at achieving a specific competitive goal good strategies promote alignment among diverse groups within an organization clarify objectives and priorities and help focus efforts around them companies regularly define their overall business strategy their scope and positioning and specify how various functions—such as marketing operations finance and rd—will support it but during my more than two decades studying and consulting for companies in a broad range of industries i have found that firms rarely articulate strategies to align their innovation efforts with their business strategies without an innovation strategy innovation improvement efforts can easily become a grab bag of muchtouted best practices dividing rd into decentralized autonomous teams spawning internal entrepreneurial ventures setting up corporate venturecapital arms pursuing external alliances embracing open innovation and crowdsourcing collaborating with customers and implementing rapid prototyping to name just a few there is nothing wrong with any of those practices per se the problem is that an organization’s capacity for innovation stems from an innovation system a coherent set of interdependent processes and structures that dictates how the company searches for novel problems and solutions synthesizes ideas into a business concept and product designs and selects which projects get funded individual best practices involve tradeoffs and adopting a specific practice generally requires a host of complementary changes to the rest of the organization’s innovation system a company without an innovation strategy won’t be able to make tradeoff decisions and choose all the elements of the innovation system aping someone else’s system is not the answer there is no one system that fits all companies equally well or works under all circumstances there is nothing wrong of course with learning from others but it is a mistake to believe that what works for say apple today’s favorite innovator is going to work for your organization an explicit innovation strategy helps you design a system to match your specific competitive needs finally without an innovation strategy different parts of an organization can easily wind up pursuing conflicting priorities—even if there’s a clear business strategy sales representatives hear daily about the pressing needs of the biggest customers marketing may see opportunities to leverage the brand through complementary products or to expand market share through new distribution channels business unit heads are focused on their target markets and their particular pl pressures rd scientists and engineers tend to see opportunities in new technologies diverse perspectives are critical to successful innovation but without a strategy to integrate and align those perspectives around common priorities the power of diversity is blunted or worse becomes selfdefeating a good example of how a tight connection between business strategy and innovation can drive longterm innovation leadership is found in corning a leading manufacturer of specialty components used in electronic displays telecommunications systems environmental products and life sciences instruments disclosure i have consulted for corning but the information in this article comes from the  hbs case study “corning  years of innovation” by h kent bowen and courtney purrington over its more than  years corning has repeatedly transformed its business and grown new markets through breakthrough innovations when judged against current best practices corning’s approach seems out of date the company is one of the few with a centralized rd laboratory sullivan park in rural upstate new york it invests a lot in basic research a practice that many companies gave up long ago and it invests heavily in manufacturing technology and plants and continues to maintain a significant manufacturing footprint in the united states bucking the trend of wholesale outsourcing and offshoring of production yet when viewed through a strategic lens corning’s approach to innovation makes perfect sense the company’s business strategy focuses on selling “keystone components” that significantly improve the performance of customers’ complex system products executing this strategy requires corning to be at the leading edge of glass and materials science so that it can solve exceptionally challenging problems for customers and discover new applications for its technologies that requires heavy investments in longterm research by centralizing rd corning ensures that researchers from the diverse disciplinary backgrounds underlying its core technologies can collaborate sullivan park has become a repository of accumulated expertise in the application of materials science to industrial problems because novel materials often require complementary process innovations heavy investments in manufacturing and technology are a must and by keeping a domestic manufacturing footprint the company is able to smooth the transfer of new technologies from rd to manufacturing and scale up production corning’s strategy is not for everyone longterm investments in research are risky the telecommunications bust in the late s devastated corning’s optical fiber business but corning shows the importance of a clearly articulated innovation strategy—one that’s closely linked to a company’s business strategy and core value proposition without such a strategy most initiatives aimed at boosting a firm’s capacity to innovate are doomed to fail find this and other hbr graphics in our  visual library connecting innovation to strategy about  years ago bristolmyers squibb bms as part of a broad strategic repositioning decided to emphasize cancer as a key part of its pharmaceutical business recognizing that biotechnologyderived drugs such as monoclonal antibodies were likely to be a fruitful approach to combating cancer bms decided to shift its repertoire of technological capabilities from its traditional organicchemistry base toward biotechnology the new business strategy emphasizing the cancer market required a new innovation strategy shifting technological capabilities toward biologics i have consulted for bms but the information in this example comes from public sources like the creation of any good strategy the process of developing an innovation strategy should start with a clear understanding and articulation of specific objectives related to helping the company achieve a sustainable competitive advantage this requires going beyond alltoocommon generalities such as “we must innovate to grow” “we innovate to create value” or “we need to innovate to stay ahead of competitors” those are not strategies they provide no sense of the types of innovation that might matter and those that won’t rather a robust innovation strategy should answer the following questions how will innovation create value for potential customers unless innovation induces potential customers to pay more saves them money or provides some larger societal benefit like improved health or cleaner water it is not creating value of course innovation can create value in many ways it might make a product perform better or make it easier or more convenient to use more reliable more durable cheaper and so on choosing what kind of value your innovation will create and then sticking to that is critical because the capabilities required for each are quite different and take time to accumulate for instance bell labs created many diverse breakthrough innovations over a half century the telephone exchange switcher the photovoltaic cell the transistor satellite communications the laser mobile telephony and the operating system unix to name just a few but research at bell labs was guided by the strategy of improving and developing the capabilities and reliability of the phone network the solidstate research program—which ultimately led to the invention of the transistor—was motivated by the need to lay the scientific foundation for developing newer more reliable components for the communications system research on satellite communications was motivated in part by the limited bandwidth and the reliability risks of undersea cables apple consistently focuses its innovation efforts on making its products easier to use than competitors’ and providing a seamless experience across its expanding family of devices and services hence its emphasis on integrated hardwaresoftware development proprietary operating systems and design makes total sense further reading beyond worldclass the new manufacturing strategy competition magazine article robert h hayes gary p pisano companies need strategies for building critical capabilities to achieve competitive advantage save share how will the company capture a share of the value its innovations generate valuecreating innovations attract imitators as quickly as they attract customers rarely is intellectual property alone sufficient to block these rivals consider how many tablet computers appeared after the success of apple’s ipad as imitators enter the market they create price pressures that can reduce the value that the original innovator captures moreover if the suppliers distributors and other companies required to deliver an innovation are dominant enough they may have sufficient bargaining power to capture most of the value from an innovation think about how most personal computer manufacturers were largely at the mercy of intel and microsoft companies must think through what complementary assets capabilities products or services could prevent customers from defecting to rivals and keep their own position in the ecosystem strong apple designs complementarities between its devices and services so that an iphone owner finds it attractive to use an ipad rather than a rival’s tablet and by controlling the operating system apple makes itself an indispensable player in the digital ecosystem corning’s customerpartnering strategy helps defend the company’s innovations against imitators once the keystone components are designed into a customer’s system the customer will incur switching costs if it defects to another supplier one of the best ways to preserve bargaining power in an ecosystem and blunt imitators is to continue to invest in innovation i recently visited a furniture company in northern italy that supplies several of the largest retailers in the world from its factories in its home region depending on a few global retailers for distribution is risky from a valuecapture perspective because these megaretailers have access to dozens of other suppliers around the world many of them in lowcost countries and because furniture designs are not easily protected through patents there is no guarantee of continued business the company has managed to thrive however by investing both in new designs which help it win business early in the product life cycle and in sophisticated process technologies which allow it to defend against rivals from lowcost countries as products mature what types of innovations will allow the company to create and capture value and what resources should each type receive certainly technological innovation is a huge creator of economic value and a driver of competitive advantage but some important innovations may have little to do with new technology in the past couple of decades we have seen a plethora of companies netflix amazon linkedin uber master the art of business model innovation thus in thinking about innovation opportunities companies have a choice about how much of their efforts to focus on technological innovation and how much to invest in business model innovation routine innovation is often called myopic or suicidal that thinking is simplistic a helpful way to think about this is depicted in the exhibit “the innovation landscape map” the map based on my research and that of scholars such as william abernathy kim clark clayton christensen rebecca henderson and michael tushman characterizes innovation along two dimensions the degree to which it involves a change in technology and the degree to which it involves a change in business model although each dimension exists on a continuum together they suggest four quadrants or categories of innovation routine innovation builds on a company’s existing technological competences and fits with its existing business model—and hence its customer base an example is intel’s launching evermorepowerful microprocessors which has allowed the company to maintain high margins and has fueled growth for decades other examples include new versions of microsoft windows and the apple iphone further reading which kind of collaboration is right for you networking magazine article gary p pisano roberto verganti the new leaders in innovation will be those who figure out the best way to leverage a network of outsiders save share disruptive innovation a category named by my harvard business school colleague clay christensen requires a new business model but not necessarily a technological breakthrough for that reason it also challenges or disrupts the business models of other companies for example google’s android operating system for mobile devices potentially disrupts companies like apple and microsoft not because of any large technical difference but because of its business model android is given away free the operating systems of apple and microsoft are not radical innovation is the polar opposite of disruptive innovation the challenge here is purely technological the emergence of genetic engineering and biotechnology in the s and s as an approach to drug discovery is an example established pharmaceutical companies with decades of experience in chemically synthesized drugs faced a major hurdle in building competences in molecular biology but drugs derived from biotechnology were a good fit with the companies’ business models which called for heavy investment in rd funded by a few highmargin products architectural innovation combines technological and business model disruptions an example is digital photography for companies such as kodak and polaroid entering the digital world meant mastering completely new competences in solidstate electronics camera design software and display technology it also meant finding a way to earn profits from cameras rather than from “disposables” film paper processing chemicals and services as one might imagine architectural innovations are the most challenging for incumbents to pursue a company’s innovation strategy should specify how the different types of innovation fit into the business strategy and the resources that should be allocated to each in much of the writing on innovation today radical disruptive and architectural innovations are viewed as the keys to growth and routine innovation is denigrated as myopic at best and suicidal at worst that line of thinking is simplistic in fact the vast majority of profits are created through routine innovation since intel launched its last major disruptive innovation the i chip in  it has earned more than  billion in operating income most of which has come from nextgeneration microprocessors microsoft is often criticized for milking its existing technologies rather than introducing true disruptions but this strategy has generated  billion in operating income since the introduction of windows nt in  and  billion since the introduction of the xbox in  apple’s last major breakthrough as of this writing the ipad was launched in  since then apple has launched a steady stream of upgrades to its core platforms mac iphone and ipad generating an eyepopping  billion in operating income the point here is not that companies should focus solely on routine innovation rather it is that there is not one preferred type in fact as the examples above suggest different kinds of innovation can become complements rather than substitutes over time intel microsoft and apple would not have had the opportunity to garner massive profits from routine innovations had they not laid the foundations with various breakthroughs conversely a company that introduces a disruptive innovation and cannot follow up with a stream of improvements will not hold new entrants at bay for long executives often ask me “what proportion of resources should be directed to each type of innovation” unfortunately there is no magic formula as with any strategic question the answer will be company specific and contingent on factors such as the rate of technological change the magnitude of the technological opportunity the intensity of competition the rate of growth in core markets the degree to which customer needs are being met and the company’s strengths businesses in markets where the core technology is evolving rapidly like pharmaceuticals media and communications will have to be much more keenly oriented toward radical technological innovation—both its opportunities and its threats a company whose core business is maturing may have to seek opportunities through business model innovations and radical technological breakthroughs but a company whose platforms are growing rapidly would certainly want to focus most of its resources on building and extending them in thinking strategically about the four types of innovation then the question is one of balance and mix google is certainly experiencing rapid growth through routine innovations in its advertising business but it is also exploring opportunities for radical and architectural innovations such as a driverless car at its google x facility apple is not resting on its iphone laurels as it explores wearable devices and payment systems and while incumbent automobile companies still make the vast majority of their revenue and profits from traditional fuelpowered vehicles most have introduced alternativeenergy vehicles hybrid and allelectric and have serious rd efforts in advanced alternatives like hydrogenfuelcell motors overcoming the prevailing winds i liken routine innovation to a sports team’s homefield advantage it’s where companies play to their strengths without an explicit strategy indicating otherwise a number of organizational forces will tend to drive innovation toward the home field some years ago i worked with a contact lens company whose leaders decided that it needed to focus less on routine innovations such as adding color tints and modifying lens design and be more aggressive in pursuing new materials that could dramatically improve visual acuity and comfort after a few years however little progress had been made a review of the rd portfolio at a senior management meeting revealed that most of the company’s rd expenditures were going to incremental refinements of existing products demanded by marketing to stave off mounting shortterm losses in share and to process improvements demanded by manufacturing to reduce costs which was in turn demanded by finance to preserve margins as prices fell even worse when rd finally created a highperforming lens based on a new material manufacturing could not produce it consistently at high volume because it had not invested in the requisite capabilities despite a strategic intent to venture into new territory the company was trapped on its home field further reading the ambidextrous ceo innovation magazine article michael l tushman wendy k smith and andy binns great leaders navigate the tension between new innovations and core products from the csuite—they don’t leave the battle to their middle managers save share the root of the problem was that business units and functions had continued to make resource allocation decisions and each favored the projects it saw as the most pressing only after senior management created explicit targets for different types of innovations—and allocated a specific percentage of resources to radical innovation projects—did the firm begin to make progress in developing new offerings that supported its longterm strategy as this company found innovation strategy matters most when an organization needs to change its prevailing patterns managing tradeoffs as i’ve noted an explicit innovation strategy helps you understand which practices might be a good fit for your organization it also helps you navigate the inherent tradeoffs consider one popular practice crowdsourcing the idea is that rather than relying on a few experts perhaps your own employees to solve specific innovation problems you open up the process to anyone the crowd one common example is when an organization posts a problem on a web platform like innocentive and invites solutions perhaps offering a financial prize another example is open source software projects in which volunteers contribute to developing a product or a system think of linux crowdsourcing has a lot of merits by inviting a vast number of people most of whom you probably could not have found on your own to address your challenges you increase the probability of developing a novel solution research by my harvard business school colleague karim lakhani and his collaborator kevin boudreau of the london business school provides strong evidence that crowdsourcing can lead to faster moreefficient and morecreative problem solving but crowdsourcing works better for some kinds of problems than for others for instance it requires fast and efficient ways to test a large number of potential solutions if testing is very timeconsuming and costly you need some other approach such as soliciting a handful of solutions from just a few experts or organizations similarly crowdsourcing tends to work best for highly modular systems in which different problem solvers can focus on specific components without worrying about others crowdsourcing is not universally good or bad it is simply a tool whose strength exploiting large numbers of diverse problem solvers is a benefit in some contexts highly diffused knowledge base relatively inexpensive ways to test proposed solutions modular system but not in others concentrated knowledge base expensive testing system with integral architectures another practice subject to tradeoffs is customer involvement in the innovation process advocates of “cocreation” approaches argue that close collaboration with customers reveals insights that can lead to novel offerings see venkat ramaswamy and francis gouillart “building the cocreative enterprise” hbr october  but others say that working too closely with customers will blind you to opportunities for truly disruptive innovation steve jobs was adamant that customers do not always know what they want—the reason he cited for eschewing market research choosing a side in this debate requires the cold calculus of strategy corning’s customercentered approach to innovation is appropriate for a company whose business strategy is focused on creating critical components of highly innovative systems it would be virtually impossible to develop such components without tapping customers’ deep understanding of their system in addition close collaboration enables corning and its customers to mutually adapt the component and the system this is critical when subtle changes in the component technology can affect the system and vice versa but corning’s demandpull approach finding customers’ highly challenging problems and then figuring out how the company’s cuttingedge technologies can solve them is limited by customers’ imagination and willingness to take risks it also hinges on picking the right customers if corning doesn’t it can miss a market transformation crowdsourcing like other innovation practices involves tradeoffs a supplypush approach—developing technology and then finding or creating a market—can be more suitable when an identifiable market does not yet exist a good example is the integrated circuit invented in the late s by texas instruments and fairchild semiconductor both came up with the idea of putting multiple transistors on a chip as a way to solve a reliability problem not to spawn smaller computers in fact with the exception of the military there was little demand for integrated circuits producers of computers electronics equipment and telecommunications systems preferred discrete transistors which were cheaper and less risky to help create demand texas instruments invented and commercialized another device the handheld calculator some pharmaceutical companies including novartis for whom i’ve consulted explicitly shield their research groups from market input when deciding which programs to pursue they believe that given the long lead times of drug development and the complexities of the market accurate forecasts are impossible see the  hbs case study “novartis ag sciencebased business” by h kent bowen and courtney purrington again the choice between a demandpull and a supplypush approach involves weighing the tradeoffs if you choose the former you risk missing out on technologies for which markets have not yet emerged if you choose the latter you may create technologies that never find a market further reading the ambidextrous organization innovation magazine article charles a o’reilly iii michael l tushman established companies can develop radical innovations—and protect their traditional businesses the secret create organizationally distinct units that are tightly integrated at the senior executive level save share similar tradeoffs are inherent in choices about innovation processes for instance many companies have adopted fairly structured “phasegate” models for managing their innovation processes advocates argue that those models inject a degree of predictability and discipline into what can be a messy endeavor opponents counter that they destroy creativity who is right both are—but for different kinds of projects highly structured phasegate processes which tend to focus on resolving as much technical and market uncertainty as possible early on work well for innovations involving a known technology for a known market but they generally do not allow for the considerable iteration required for combinations of new markets and new technologies those uncertain and complex projects require a different kind of process one that involves rapid prototyping early experimentation parallel problem solving and iteration clarity around which tradeoffs are best for the company as a whole—something an innovation strategy provides—is extremely helpful in overcoming the barriers to the kind of organizational change innovation often requires people don’t resist change because they are inherently stubborn or political but because they have different perspectives—including on how to weigh the tradeoffs in innovation practices clarity around tradeoffs and priorities is a critical first step in mobilizing the organization around an innovation initiative the leadership challenge creating a capacity to innovate starts with strategy the question then arises whose job is it to set this strategy the answer is simple the most senior leaders of the organization innovation cuts across just about every function only senior leaders can orchestrate such a complex system they must take prime responsibility for the processes structures talent and behaviors that shape how an organization searches for innovation opportunities synthesizes ideas into concepts and product designs and selects what to do there are four essential tasks in creating and implementing an innovation strategy the first is to answer the question “how are we expecting innovation to create value for customers and for our company” and then explain that to the organization the second is to create a highlevel plan for allocating resources to the different kinds of innovation ultimately where you spend your money time and effort is your strategy regardless of what you say the third is to manage tradeoffs because every function will naturally want to serve its own interests only senior leaders can make the choices that are best for the whole company the final challenge facing senior leadership is recognizing that innovation strategies must evolve any strategy represents a hypothesis that is tested against the unfolding realities of markets technologies regulations and competitors just as product designs must evolve to stay competitive so too must innovation strategies like the process of innovation itself an innovation strategy involves continual experimentation learning and adaptation a version of

answers this question by providing an incisive critique of the industry pisano not only reveals biotechs most daunting challenges he offers the most sophisticated analysis yet of how the industry works and he provides clear prescriptions for companies investors and policymakers seeking ways to improve the industrys performancejacket the development factory  unlocking the potential of process innovation by gary p pisano book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide when the pharmaceuticals giant merck reports promising results for a potential blockbuster drug the story makes the evening news now at a time when new product development has become critical to success in so many industries the development factory proves that process innovation  not just product innovation  can be the key to competitive edge in this multiyear study of pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms gary pisano explores the dynamics of superior product and process development in a highly competitive industry that lives and dies by its r  d and depends heavily on rapid time to market his work reveals that behind the success of many new product introductions lies the development of novel process technologies that provide lower costs higher quality and increased flexibility manufacturing renaissance book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide producing prosperity  why america needs a manufacturing renaissance by gary p pisano book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide companies compete on the decisions they make for yearseven decadesin response to intensifying global competition companies decided to outsource their manufacturing operations in order to reduce costs but we are now seeing the alarming longterm effect of those choices in many cases once manufacturing capabilities go away so does much of the ability to innovate and compete manufacturing it turns out really matters in an innovationdriven economy in producing prosperity harvard business school professors gary pisano and willy shih show the disastrous consequences of years of poor sourcing decisions and underinvestment in manufacturing capabilities they reveal how todays undervalued manufacturing operations often hold the seeds of tomorrows innovative new products arguing that companies must reinvest in new product and process development in the us industrial sector only by reviving this bindustrial commons can the worlds largest economy build the expertise and manufacturing muscle to regain competitive advantage america needs a manufacturing renaissancefor restoring itself and for the global economy as a whole this will require major changes pisano and shih show how companylevel choices are key to the sustained success of industries and economies and they provide business leaders with a framework for understanding the links between manufacturing and innovation that will enable them to make better outsourcing decisions they also detail how government must change its support of basic and applied scientific research and promote collaboration between business and academia for executives policymakers academics and innovators alike producing prosperity provides the clearest and most compelling account yet of how the

this business strategy text helps students master a body of analytical tools and develop an integrative point of view when making strategic choices it focuses on strategies that offer the greatest potential for improving business performance the effect of organizational context on individual performance by robert s huckman book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide many observers have suggested that highly skilled workers convey little in the way of competitive advantage for firms due to their mobility implicit in this view is the belief that organizations are not important in determining individual performance in this study we address this issue by examining skilled individuals who work within multiple organizations roughly simultaneously specifically we consider the performance of cardiac surgeons many of whom perform operations at multiple hospitals during the course of a given year using patient mortality as an outcome measure we find that the quality of a surgeons performance at a given hospital improves significantly with increases in his or her annual procedure volume at that hospital but does not significantly improve with increases in his or her volume at other hospitals our findings suggest that surgeon performance is not fully portable across hospitals ie some portion of performance is firm specific we consider the implications of our results for settings beyond health care innovation through markets hierarchies and joint ventures  technology strategy and collaborative arrangements in

reports on a multimethod study of  hospitals implementing an innovative technology for cardiac surgery toinvestigate organizational adaptation to new technology and how group and organizational characteristics influences this process and its outcomes the findings reveal substantial differences in how an identical technology was integrated into ongoing practice in a set of structurally homogeneous organizations a set of factors at the group level of analysis differentiated successful and unsuccessful adopters characteristics of operating room teams charged with implementing the new technologysuch as team leader behavior team psychological safety team learning behavior and boundary spanningwere associated with successful adoption team membership stability was associated with the rate of efficiency improvement using the new technology organizational factors such as size type academic versus community hospital and organizational support for and experience with innovation were not associated with either outcome we propose a theoretical model in which psychological safety and team learning behavior enable organization adaptation and team learning may moderate the strong

learning new technical and interpersonal routines in operating room teams  the case of minimally invasive cardiac surgery by amy c edmondson book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide this study investigates operating room teams confronted with learning a radically new technology for performing cardiac surgery past research in medicine has found that experience using new techniques leads to steady improvement but has not investigated organizational and group characteristics that may facilitate obtaining the right kinds of experience and ultimately facilitate successful adoption of new approaches this paper begins to address this gap by examining organizational and group characteristics that vary across operating room teams learning a new technology a specific barrier to learning that these teams faced was the highly precise routines characterizing the conventional surgical procedure the new technology disrupted these routines requiring the operating room teams to relearn how to work together the authors report on data collected in  interviews with members of the operating room and others associated with the cardiac surgery process at  hospitals foreign competition and domestic innovation  evidence from us patents by david h autor book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member library worldwide manufacturing is the locus of us innovation accounting for more than three quarters of us corporate patents the rise of import competition from china has represented a major competitive shock to the sector which in theory could benefit or stifle innovation in this paper we empirically examine how rising import competition from china has affected us innovation we confront two empirical challenges in assessing the impact we map all us utility patents granted by march  to firmlevel data using a novel internetbased matching algorithm that corrects for a preponderance of false negatives when using firm names alone and we contend with the fact that patenting is highly concentrated in certain product categories and that this concentration has been shifting over time accounting for secular trends in innovative activities we find that the impact of the change in import exposure on the change in patents produced is strongly negative it remains so once we add an extensive set of further industry and firmlevel controls rising import exposure also reduces global employment global sales and global rd expenditure at the firm level it would appear that a simple mechanism in which greater foreign competition induces us manufacturing firms to contract their operations along multiple margins of activity goes a long way toward explaining the response of us innovation to the china trade shock

by giada di stefano francesca gino gary pisano  bradley staats knowledge plays an important role in the productivity and prosperity of economies organizations and individuals even so research on learning has primarily focused on the role of doing experience in fostering progress over time to compare the effectiveness of different sources of learning the authors take a micro approach and study learning at the individual level they argue that learning from direct experience can be more effective if coupled with reflection—that is the intentional attempt to synthesize abstract and articulate the key lessons taught by experience using a mixedmethod approach that combines laboratory experiments and a field study in a large business process outsourcing company in india they find support for this prediction further they find that the effect of reflection on learning is mediated by greater perceived ability to achieve a goal ie selfefficacy together these results reveal reflection to be a powerful mechanism behind learning confirming the words of american philosopher psychologist and educational reformer john dewey we do not learn from experience  we learn from reflecting on experience key concepts include learning from direct experience can be more effective if coupled with reflectionthat is the intentional attempt to synthesize abstract and articulate the key lessons taught by experience reflecting on what has been learned makes experience more productive reflection builds ones confidence in the ability to achieve a goal ie selfefficacy which in turn translates into higher

comments posted  may  working paper summaries creating an rd strategy by gary p pisano this note by gary p pisano provides a framework for designing an rd strategy it starts with the simple notion that a strategy is a system approach to solving a problem an rd strategy is defined a coherent set of interrelated choices across decision concerning organizational architecture processes people and project portfolios to illustrate the framework we use examples of three pharmaceutical companies and examine how their different rd strategies were rooted in different assumptions about the core driver of rd performance this suggests that the very first question to be answered in strategy development is whats our shared understanding of the root cause of the problem we are trying to solve key concepts include a good strategy provides consistency coherence and alignment the game plan for an rd organization can be broken down into  strategic levers architecture processes people and portfolio together decisions made in each of these categories constitute the rd strategy rd performance results from the interaction of many different decisions and choices including the size and location of rd facilities the division of labor between various groups the choice of technologies used inside the rd organization the selection of personnel the allocation of resources the design of processes for managing projects and other factors closed for comment  comments posted  mar  research  ideas why manufacturing matters by roger thompson after decades of outsourcing americas ability to innovate and

comments posted  feb  working paper summaries the evolution of sciencebased business innovating how we innovate by gary p pisano science has long been connected to innovation and thus to the business enterprise however the nature of the connection between science and business in recent decades has begun to change in important ways on the one hand we have witnessed the decline of corporate industrial laboratories at the same time we have seen the emergence of a new class of entrepreneurial firms that are deeply immersed in science in sectors like biotech nanotech and more recently energy hbs professor gary p pisano examines the changing nature of the sciencebusiness intersection and describes the emergence of a sciencebased business as a novel organizational form he also describes the institutional and organizational challenges created by this convergence key concepts include sciencebased businesses face unique challenges as they straddle two worlds with very different time horizons risks expectations and norms the professions of management and of science are still largely separate scientists receive no formal training in management and mbas receive no training in science this is a striking gap today the invisible hand of markets increasingly governs sciencebased businesses assessing this form of governance against the requirements of sciencebased businesses suggests the need for organizational innovation closed for comment  comments posted  aug  research  ideas creating leaders for sciencebased businesses by garry emmons the unique challenges

past several decades teaches us that behavioral biases and cognitive limits are not just noise they systematically affect and often distort peoples judgment and decision making despite such advances however most scholarly research in operations management still assumes that agents—be they decision makers problem solvers implementers workers or customers—either are fully rational or can be induced

operations management models it then points to fruitful areas for future research key concepts include a behavioral approach to operations management can lead to a better understanding of underlying drivers of operating systems performance and also to a better understanding of puzzling pathologies such as excess inventory late product development projects and overcommitment to research and

the reason is not simply a failure to execute but a failure to articulate an innovation strategy that aligns innovation efforts with the overall business strategy without such a strategy companies will have a hard time weighing the tradeoffs of various practices—such as crowdsourcing and customer cocreation—and so may end up with a grab bag of approaches they will have trouble designing a coherent innovation system that fits their competitive needs over time and may be tempted to ape someone elses system and so they will find it difficult to align different parts of the organization with shared priorities as corning a leader in glass and materials science has found an innovation strategy must address how innovation will create value for potential customers how the company will capture a share of that value and what types of innovation to pursue critics tend to discount routine innovation that leverages a companys existing technical capabilities and business model and extol disruptive innovation but that is a simplistic view a companys unique competitive circumstances should dictate the innovation portfolio it pursues because innovation cuts across functions only senior leaders can set an innovation strategy in doing so they must recognize that the strategy like the process of innovation itself requires continual experimentation and adaptation keywords innovation

narrow financial criteria they dont consider whether keeping manufacturing at home makes more sense strategically or take into account the impact it might have on their ability to innovate the result has been an exodus of manufacturing from america which has weakened the capabilities that domestic firms need to keep inventing highquality costcompetitive products one problem is that its hard to tell when moving production far from rd will do damage to make that determination we say that executives need to examine two things the first is modularity or the degree to which product design can be separated from manufacturing when modularity is low product designs cant be clearly specified and design choices affect manufacturing processes in subtle difficulttopredict ways and vice versa the second is the maturity of the manufacturing process immature processes are ripe for innovation but over time opportunities for improvement become incremental viewed through the modularitymaturity lens

business review why leaders dont learn from success francesca gino and gary p pisano we argue that for a variety of psychological reasons it is often much harder for leaders and organizations to learn from success than to learn from failure success creates three kinds of traps that often impede deep learning the first is attribution error or the tendency to see superior performance as rooted in ones actions rather than other factors such as luck the second is that success feeds overconfidence bias which can then blind leaders to potential future problems and opportunities for innovation the third is a tendency to fail to probe the root causes of success whereas postmortems after failure are becoming a norm in many organizations such soul searching rarely occurs after success this causes leaders and their organizations to miss opportunities to develop deep causal knowledge that can lead to greater longterm improvements we suggest a number of concrete actions leaders can take to help

politecnico di milano developed a simple framework focused on two questions given your strategy how open or closed should your network of collaborators be and who should decide which problems to tackle and which solutions to adopt there are four basic modes of collaboration say the authors an elite circle is a closed network with a hierarchical governance one company selects the participants defines the problem and chooses the solution for instance alessi an italian homeproducts company invited  outside experts in postmodern architecture to contribute ideas for new homeproduct designs an innovation mall is hierarchical but open anyone can post a problem or propose solutions in it but the company posting the problem chooses the solution an example is innocentivecom an ebaylike site where companies post scientific challenges an innovation community is open and decentralized anyone can propose problems offer solutions and decide which ideas to use  as happens in the opensource software community linux a consortium is a private group of participants that operate as equals and jointly select problems decide how to conduct work and choose solutions ibm has set up a number of

autor david dorn gordon h hanson pian shu and gary pisano manufacturing is the locus of us innovation accounting for more than three quarters of us corporate patents the rise of import competition from china has represented a major competitive shock to the sector which in theory could benefit or stifle innovation in this paper we empirically examine how rising import competition from china has affected us innovation we confront two empirical challenges in assessing the impact we map all us utility patents granted by march  to firmlevel data using a novel internetbased matching algorithm that corrects for a preponderance of false negatives when using firm names alone and we contend with the fact that patenting is highly concentrated in certain product categories and that this concentration has been shifting over time accounting for secular trends in innovative activities we find that the impact of the change in import exposure on the change in patents produced is strongly negative it remains so once we add an extensive set of further industry and firmlevel controls rising import exposure also reduces global employment global sales and global rd expenditure at the firm level it would appear that a simple mechanism in which greater foreign competition induces us manufacturing firms to contract their operations along multiple margins of activity goes a long way toward explaining the response of us innovation to the china trade shock keywords patents competition system shocks trade innovation and invention manufacturing industry china united states citationautor

dates back to the work of andrews  attempts to formalize a “capabilities based” approach to strategy only began to take shape in the past twenty years in particular the publication of teece and pisano  teece pisano and shuen  and eisenhart and martin  works on “dynamic capabilities” triggered a flood of debate and discussion on the topic unfortunately the literature on dynamic capabilities has become mired in endless debates about definitions and has engaged in an elusive search for properties that make organizations adaptable this paper argues that the research program on dynamic capabilities needs to be reset around the fundamental strategic problem facing firms how to identify and select capabilities that lead to competitive advantage to this end the paper develops a framework that attempts to connect firms’ capability search strategies with their strategies in product markets it frames firms’ capability search strategies as choices among different types of capability enhancing investments the key distinguishing feature of capabilities in this framework is their degree of fungibility capabilities span a continuum ranging from highly general purpose eg quality management to highly market specific eg knowing how to manufacture an airplane wing to illustrate the potential of the framework to shed new light on traditional strategy questions the paper applies the framework to explore some unexplained features of penrosian diversification strategies the paper concludes by suggesting a research agenda for dynamic capabilities keywords competitive

it is widely presumed that in todays globalized economy the value of geographic clustering of manufacturing industries is no longer valuable manufacturing is represented as a highly mobile commodity that can be sourced from anywhere in the world where factor costs are favorable this paper reexamines this assumption and suggests that not all manufacturing is highly mobile we suggest that manufacturing sectors should be viewed along a continuum from highly mobile to highly sticky manufacturing clusters can decline for two completely different reasons the first is a change in technology that reduces the value of colocation stickiness this tends to lead to the decoupling of design and production activities and to a broad geographic diffusion of manufacturing the second is a shift in the relative comparative advantage of clusters located in one region versus another under this scenario geographic concentration is still valuable but the center of production activity can shift from one location to another the paper then analyzes how firm supply chain strategies impact stickiness and the survival of manufacturing clusters keywords manufacturing industry manufacturing

of pharmaceutical rd laboratories francesca lazzeri and gary p pisano scholars and practitioners alike now recognize that a firms capacity to assimilate and use knowhow from external sources—what cohen and levinthal  called absorptive capacity—plays a central role in innovation performance in recent years a common strategy pursued by companies to increase their absorptive capacity has been to locate new rd facilities in close geographic proximity to technology hotspots like cambridge massachusetts or the san francisco bay area such a strategy is predicated on the assumption that geographic proximity facilitates absorption unfortunately more than two decades after the publication of cohen and levinthals landmark piece on absorptive capacity precious little is known about how different organizational strategies and managerial practices—including location choices—actually impact a firms ability to exploit external sources of knowhow a key barrier to empirical progress on this front has been a lack of direct measures of absorption in this paper we develop a novel measure of absorptive capacity that attempts to directly track the influence of external sources of knowhow on the internal rd activities of individual laboratories we then use this measure to examine laboratory level differences in absorptive capacity and the degree to which a labs geographic proximity to a given knowledge base influences its absorptive capacity to identify patterns of absorption we exploit a quasinatural experiment that has occurred in the pharmaceutical industry over the past two decades since  a number of major pharmaceutical companies merck novartis pfizer etc have chosen to locate new laboratories in one or more major life science hotspots massachusetts the san francisco bay area and san diego county because these are de novo greenfield labs we have an unusual opportunity to study how the capabilities of the lab evolved over time and whether those capabilities were influenced by the technological activities of the surrounding local scientific and technological ecosystems our sample includes  rd laboratories at varying degrees of distance from three major life sciences hotspots—massachusetts san diego county and the san francisco bay area our findings indicate that geographic proximity is a significant predictor of how much knowhow a lab absorbs from a given hotspot the importance of geographic proximity is also shown to be increasing over time however our results also show significant residual variance at both the individual laboratory and company levels suggesting an important role of managerial practices and policies in driving absorption the latter finding was consistent with our field interviews of rd executives from laboratories involved in our study the study provides further evidence of the geographically bounded nature of knowledge keywords geographic location industry clusters knowledge acquisition pharmaceutical industry san francisco

individual underpinnings of organizational learning we argue that once an individual has accumulated experience with a task the benefit of accumulating additional experience is inferior to the benefit of deliberately articulating and codifying the previously accumulated experience we explain the performance outcomes associated with such deliberate learning efforts using both a cognitive task

related working paper  hbs working paper series   collaborative architectures for innovation gary p pisano and roberto verganti collaborative innovation has become a hot topic in innovation today scholars consultants and the business press all urge companies seeking to boost innovative performance to become more collaborative too often however companies fail to distinguish among the various choices they face with respect to alternative modes of collaboration collaborative innovation can take a wide variety of forms each with profound implications for innovative performance and the value a firm can capture from innovation building on a number of case studies this paper presents a simple framework for categorizing different collaborative modes the framework is based on the notion that there are two critical dimensions along which collaborative efforts can be characterized the first dimension relates to the degree to which the collaborative network is open verses closed the second dimension relates to the degree to which the governance structure for collaboration is hierarchical verses flat while discussions of collaborative innovation often take the position that open networks are superior to closed networks and that flat governance structures are superior to hierarchical structures our framework provides a more nuanced view of the tradeoffs the choice among alternative collaborative modes should be driven by a number of factors including characteristics of the technology the capabilities of the firm and the distribution of competences in the environment we develop a set of guidelines for helping firms choose among collaborative models and discuss critical enabling conditions required for each to work in practice in the final section of the paper we discuss how firms can mix and match multiple modes of collaboration into coherent architectures that lie at the heart of innovation strategy keywords competency and skills governance controls collaborative
