of the way let me turn the call over to sven svenolof lindblad thanks craig and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us im pleased to say that lindblad expeditions is off to a strong start in  as the booking momentum we generated during the end of  is accelerated into this year during our first quarter reservations for future travel were record shattering eclipsing the same period in  by  and  by  and this strength was very much broad based with significant growth across virtually every one of our destinations increasingly not only are we seeing increased booking activity for travel in the current year but we are also generating significantly more demand for itineraries in  the timing of marketing material versus the year ago certainly plays into this but its clear that the overall interest in our expanding offerings continue to grow and the increase demand further bolsters our confidence in our longterm growth plan  is significant for us symbolically we’re celebrating the th anniversary of my fathers ground breaking expeditions to the galápagos islands which followed last years th anniversary of his historic first passenger expedition to antarctica these milestones remind us all of the heritage of the expedition travel and lindblad in particular a deeply rooted heritage that blends geography knowledge and a laser focus on providing our guests with the most fulfilling experience as possible it is a combination of these factors that i believe are critical to the relationship and trust we have developed over decades with our myriad constitutions there is a vast community of people in the united states and abroad who created the notion of experience as core ingredient of their lives they are willing to invest significantly in these experiences provided they believe a company has the ability and the commitment to fill their desires we have always known that however it is more important now than ever before everyone in this organization is fully cognizant of that salient fact and committed to ensuring we deliver on that promise for each and every one of our guests at every step along their journey in their first engagement for the booking process and travel preparations during the actual expedition whether on board or off and once back at home our guests do not want to be passive tours and we foster active engagement with an experienced expedition team on vessels that are ideally equipped for exploration we also spend a significant amount of time and resources ensuring these vessels are rigorously maintained in accordance with applicable regulations international conventions and insurance requirements despite these steps there are times when unforeseen repairs become necessary in some rare cases voyages that have already been heavily booked need to the cancelled this was the case with the orion after the engine failure on december th in antarctica an incident of this magnitude was unprecedented in our history as we have never had calls to cancel the entire season previously but i am pleased to inform you that the orion returned to service april th as planned and guests are currently enjoying it in itineraries unfortunately this past quarter we also had an issue with an airconditioning system on the national geographic sea lion which results in cancelling two weeks in central america these mechanical issues have of course affected our financial results which craig will cover in a moment however it is important to emphasize that these incidents while unfortunate were in no way symptomatic of any long term factors not age of the vessels not lack of proper maintenance there were simply events that really but periodically can and will affect the vessel looking ahead we are little over a month away from the inaugural voyage of the us built national geographic quest the first installment if you will of our long term growth plan she is essentially sold out for our last season and its gratifying to see that our other ships operating in the area doing well despite the added inventory it verifies our original thesis that adding to this geography was solidly rooted in excess demand she will be the most sophisticated passenger vessel built in the us in decades and we are incredibly excited to launch our first entirely new purpose built expedition ship for sister ship the national geographic venture is on track for delivery in q of  and we are very close of selecting a shipyard for our planned blue water vessel for delivery in q  this will i believe be the most thought out and equipped global expedition ship in the world enabling us to penetrate regions inaccessible before and great comfort within array of modern tools for enhancing the expeditions tours as we increase our capacity we also continue to hone our human resources so that we can out skip upbeat as this growth kicks in at the end of the day its not all about hardware but about the people in the field captains expedition leaders chefs naturalists et cetera who make these expeditions powerful and memorable recruitment training our development are key to success we have also significantly augmented our marketing and sales platform adding fields sales representative broadening our communications tools and developing partnerships to generate audience interest we also continued to see great promise in natural habitat which is providing  proving to be a valuable acquisition this is particularly true as it relates to cross selling which has grown exponentially since may  we will continue to look for opportunities to add companies or products with economics brand fit and management ability come together along those lines i’ve just returned from a two week expedition in the south pacific with a writer a film team and dive experts to help craft another series of expeditions for our guests this expedition will bring voyage to a seven month deployment of the national geographic orion beginning in march of  what i saw the people i met the opportunities on earth will add greatly to a remarkable experience with intent to provide linblad expeditions is technical difficulty company with a dominant equity as our hardware we are rather a mission driven enterprises whose value is our ability to connect our guests with the world in deep meaningful fairly research ways the name lindblad expeditions is not meant to be taken that lightly nor is our partnership with national geographic we are not only offering expeditions but live and breathe in that faith on a daily basis which ultimately provides the greatest value of all relevance and now let me turn the call over to craig to discuss our financial results in detail craig felenstein thanks sven as sven mentioned lindblad has started  with sustained operating momentum bookings continued to pace well ahead of a year ago and given our average booking over approximately nine months the strength we are seeing today should translate into substantial revenue growth in the back half of this year and beyond this combined with the significant demand for our first new build the national geographic quest continues to give us confidence in the longterm growth targets we have laid out there are some shortterm hurdles that will impact the current year which i will discuss in a moment but the growing demand for expedition travel combined with our expanding capacity and lindblad’s distinguished track record in delivering unparalleled expedition experiences has us poised to deliver increasing shareholder value in the years ahead turning the first quarter on a reported basis lindblad delivered revenue growth of  versus the first quarter of  while adjusted ebitda declined by  these results included contributions from natural habitat which was acquired during the second quarter of  as well as the impact of several voyage cancellations in the current year excluding these voyage cancellations we estimate revenue growth would have been  and adjusted ebitda would have declined approximately  the lindblad segment reported revenues of  million  million below a year ago due to lower ticker revenue from the previously discussed cancellation of four voyages on the national geographic orion to perform necessary engine repairs as well as the unplanned cancellation of two voyages on the national geographic sea lion to repair the air conditioning system all of these voyages were highly booked at the time of cancellation so the revenue loss was significant over  million  million in ticket revenues offset by  million of insurance revenue to cover certain expenses excluding the impact of these cancellations we estimate lindblad segment revenue growth would have been approximately  versus the first quarter a year ago available guest nights in the quarter declined  primarily driven by the cancelled voyages partially offset by the additional charter nights from the launch of our expeditions in cuba occupancy in the quarter was  versus  a year ago primarily due to the booking headwinds we saw during the early part of  that we have discussed previously despite these headwinds net yield remained in line with the year ago at  per night primarily due to the higher rates versus the first quarter a year ago given the high occupancy and price points of the cancelled voyages they did negatively impact our metrics in the quarter we estimate that occupancy would have been over  and net yield would have been approximately  if not for the cancellations turning to the cost side of the business lindblad segment operating expenses were up  primarily driven by  million increase in stockbased compensation mainly associated with sven’s distribution of his personal shares to the employee base this was partially offset by accelerated depreciation a year ago due to the december retirement of the national geographic endeavour for the full year of  we anticipate approximately  million of additional stockbased compensation versus  with the vast majority of this increase related to the ceo distribution excluding stockbased compensation and depreciation and amortization total operating expenses were  lower than the first quarter a year ago primarily due to the decline in ga expenses from lower employee cost which were mostly offset by an increase in cost of tours the increased cost to tours reflects the addition of expeditions in cuba and unanticipated reimbursement costs to guest due to the cancellation of the orion and sea lion voyages partially offset by lower fuel cost fuel cost in the quarter was  below prior year at  of revenue compared with  of revenue in the first quarter of  adjusted net cruise cost on a per night basis increased  but the majority of this increase reflected a decline in available guest nights due to the voyage cancellations overall on a report basis the lower revenue due to the voyage cancellations resulted in adjusted ebitda that was  million lower at the lindblad segment versus the first quarter a year ago excluding the impact of these voyage cancellations we estimate adjusted ebitda in the quarter would have approximately  million or  below the prior year reflecting the lower occupancy total company net income in the quarter was  million or  per share as compared with  million or  per share in the first quarter of  the yearonyear decline was primarily driven by the lower operating results and  million of higher stockbased compensations turning to the balance sheet we remain extremely well positioned to invest in future growth opportunities we ended the quarter with  million in unrestricted cash free cash flow for the quarter was a use of  million which included  million spent on the new builds and an additional  million spent on vessels repairs that is expected to be reimbursed including only maintenance capex free cash flow was a slight source in the first quarter given the strength of our balance sheet the confidence we have in our longterm growth opportunity and the belief that the company’s share and warrant prices are not reflective of the value of the company and our prospects we repurchased  shares and  warrants for  million during the first quarter under our  million stock and warrant repurchase plan as of may st we have approximately  million remaining under the existing plan it is important to note that our first priority for capital allocation is investing in our existing businesses and external growth opportunities that will enhance our long term growth profile turning to the full year  the lindblad segment is currently pacing  million ahead of the same point a year ago despite the voyage cancellations on the orion and sea lion and it is primarily due to the additional inventory from the anticipated launch of the national geographic quest in june and from the additional charter expeditions in cuba we are currently at  of our full year projected ticket revenues for  which compares to  of the  full year ticket revenue at the same time a year ago factoring in the estimated  million in revenue and  million in adjusted ebitda impacts from the six voyage cancellations we now expect total company tour revenue in  between  million and  million  to  growth versus  and adjusted ebitda between  million and  million or  to  growth versus  the change versus our original guidance is due to the impact of the sea lion cancellations and some unanticipated costs related to the orion cancellations it is important to note that these impacts are shortterm and we remain on track with the long term financial objectives that were led out when the company went public in  please note that current expectations are for the second quarter results and metrics to be down yearonyear while bookings yeartodate in  are up over  versus the prior year given the long time experienced in most locations we are still seeing the impact of some of the booking softness during the first half of  we will also be impacted by the timing of voyages which will defer some revenue until the third quarter that was previously recognized in the second quarter in  looking at the back half of the year q and q results will benefit from the strong bookings over the last nine months and the launch of the national geographic quest additionally natural habitat had seasonality to the results with a significant portion of their revenue in the second half of the year and the majority of the annual adjusted ebitda that will be recognized technical difficulty thanks for your time this morning and now sven ian and i would be happy to answer any questions that you may have questionandanswer session operator and at this time we will begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question today comes from steve kozel with deutsche bank please go ahead unidentified analyst any early read you can share with us on  booking pace svenolof lindblad right now we’re seeing some significant strength in  out of the gate its actually ramped up rather quickly compared to  at the same time for  about  greater this year than it was the same time year ago interestingly enough but  pace is also significantly ahead of where it was in  for  at that point we’re probably about  to  higher than that pace so we are seeing some significant bookings already for  and it speaks to not only this strength today but also some of the weakness that we’re seeing a year ago at the same time unidentified analyst and then in terms of customer origin any kind of outbound markets that you’ve been seeing  that you’re seeing that are particularly strong or weak svenolof lindblad when you say outbound origins the majority of our guest only come to us in terms of the markets that today are strong it’s the market that traditionally we do really really well and we’re seeing strength in alaska we’re seeing strength in indiscernible we’re seeing strength in the galápagos so we continue to see strength in those markets that our guests have been utilizing for us for very long time operator operator instructions our next question today comes from greg pendy with sidoti please go ahead greg pendy just looking over to natural habitat i know i believe the second quarter last year was that a partial close when you did roughly  million or was that the full quarter just trying to understand the seasonality of the business svenolof lindblad the deal closed towards the end of may actually it was more towards the beginning of may but yes it was a partial quarter i think it was may th was the actual date so youre seeing a partial quarter in q and then a full quarter in q and q greg pendy and then just as a followup can you talk a little bit what type of cross selling because i guess you didn’t have any revenues from march last year but i mean what type of synergies you are seeing are you seeing just from sharing i guess the database of clients ian rogers so one of the things we know is the demographics of nat habs clientele and ours are quite similar also very much oriented to nature based travel and so nat hab offering our products to their audience and vice versa has proven to be very effective we’ve been testing in a variety of different ways to see how that could be most cost effective in terms of distributing these ideas across from our company to nat hab and nat hab to us but its growing monthbymonth and we’re finding a lot of synergy in that area operator our next question today comes from greg indiscernible with citigroup please go ahead frederick wightman this is actually fred wightman on for greg i know that you said that most of the delta in the guidance is due to the cancellation from the sea lion but did you also say there were some unexpected costs from the orion any sense for how big that was craig felenstein when you look at the original expectation that we had heading into the year the expectation was the orion impact was going to be about  million the overall voyage cancellation impact so far or i should say allin for this year is about  million the delta between those two things is pretty much split evenly between the sea lion and the orion the sea lion costs are significant from a cancellation perspective because the cancellation was only for two voyages and did not exceed the  day window that we typically have for our loss on higher reimbursement so the sea lion impact was partially because of that it was partially because of additional costs that we utilized to take our guests down there that had already traveled down to where the sea lion was leaving from and so that was the impact on the sea lion the orion impacts there was additional costs that we decided to take on to take care of our guests from cancelation costs that they had on air fare cancellation cost that they had on the hotel side of things there was also some charter costs that we had to take up that previously we were looking to get rid of so there was some additional cost on the orion side that certainly took place in the quarter a lot of the costs related to both of these things related to taking care of our guests that were into these because of these things and about spend mostly go little bit in terms of that the first that we took svenolof lindblad well at the end of the day what became paramount in terms of our priority was to make sure that every single individual who was inconvenienced some were greatly inconvenienced ie they’re already down there when it became apparent they could not continue their voyage and so what we just wanted make sure was that we treated all those people as well as we possibly could in order to maintain long term relationships with them and interestingly enough more than  of the people who were cancelled off the orion and antarctica within week so we booked on another voyage and i think is a reflection of the fact that we took care of them very very well and some of the cost related so that certainly exceeded our expectations and certainly the air lines that were not nearly as cooperative as one would have liked to the circumstance like this in terms of imposing cancellation penalties but just to be clear whenever and fortunately its extremely rare that we do have an incidence like this its critical for us to take very very very good care of our guests in certain instances we paid for them to stay down in argentina for several days so that the transition back to the united states was as easy as possible certainly weren’t obligated to do that technically but chose to do that as it relates to maintaining those relationships frederick wightman so just on a related note i mean do you think that these cancellations are hurting the brand among your potential customers or do you think that that  of rebooking figure is a positive overall svenolof lindblad once again i’ve learned over the years is that if and when anything bad happens and you deal with people respectfully and with a notion that they are the priority they become the most loyal clients you could possibly have and i have every single time and there have been few incidences but it could be something its weather related or whatever whatever it is the inconveniences to guest if you take care of them well they become your greatest advocates and so i believe that these people will be talking to tons of other people about how they were treated in a bad circumstance and that will reflect well on the company frederick wightman and then i think toward to end you mentioned the cost in cuba were little bit higher than you anticipated could you just talk about what the feedback from that market has been so far was that comment relative to your plan or just relative to the existing book of business previously craig felenstein ill let sven talk about how cuba is going but in terms of the cost the cost actually came in line with our expectations they were just higher than last year because we did not have the cuba voyages a year ago so when you look at things yearonyear there is additional costs related to that but the cost themselves came in very much in line with what expected this quarter svenolof lindblad well i think that probably answered the question to that answer the question or is there an additional element that you’d like covered frederick wightman just broadly speaking i mean any feedback from it is that are you still satisfied with what youre seeing in the market anything that’s different than you expected svenolof lindblad well i think in cuba almost everything is different and expected because when you walk into a country like that or develop an idea in a country like as new as circumstances are in a country like that there are plenty of surprises fortunately we have a very strong team on the ground that’s been actively engaged in monitoring every aspect of whats going on there and able to adjust accordingly it will take a while before cuba is really stable from the perspective of reliability that mean if you would compare it to lets say european context it has and will continue to provide some surprises but the general appreciation of cuba as a destination is high from the perspective of our audience understands the fact that not everything works like clockwork in this country and they really i think appreciate access to an unusual program in this most interesting of countries operator our next question today comes from george kelly with imperial capital please go ahead george kelly a couple of questions for you first if i could start with the quest wondering if you could talk about how the pricing and booking patterns played out versus your initial expectations before you started selling it and then if you could quantify expected revenue contribution from that shift this year craig felenstein look ill handle the second one first we’re not going to into specifically individual revenue contribution for a specific vessel when we did go public in  we laid out that for the first year because it was the half year you were looking somewhere in that  million to  million of revenue for the vessel overall so im not going to say much more than that because that’s been out there in public domain so we’re going to shy away from talking about individual vessel contributions but ian why don’t you talk about the booking patterns ian rogers quest has been extraordinarily well received in the market we have experienced very strong bookings from the moment we announced the vessel and that pattern continues through to launch the end of june and we’re excited its a newest us flagged vessel in anyone fleet built with very high standard built in the us and all of our travel partners were excited as well as within the company around this so bookings has been strong from all segments of our business george kelly and then second question on the growth metrics you provided about the first quarter in bookings in which it sounds like a very strong environment that includes natural habitat correct and is there any way you could take natural habitat out of your booking numbers for this years first quarter to compare them with last year craig felenstein george so when we talk about bookings we talk about booking specific to the lindblad segment to the lindblad fleet so when we talk about  growth positive that and we’re seeing in the first quarter that just relates to the lindblad fleet and does not include nat hab interestingly we certainly have more available inventory we talked about the quest and we talked about cuba but we did have the offsetting negative this time now associated with the orion and sea lion so the  plus booking trend that you’ve seen in first quarter that sven spoke about is really just a indication of how strong things are looking forward to future travel so we feel very optimistic about things once again pass these voyage cancellations that we have to deal within the first quarter george kelly and then last question on potential acquisitions can you talk about the pipeline do you feel like there is some things that seem  do you have a full pipeline are you happy where you’re at with potential acquisitions craig felenstein i think when it comes to acquisition the company has from even before went public has been very open and honest about the fact that we are open for business we are always looking at new and i would say compatible ways to expand the business opportunity for us in the long term we think we have a significant amount of growth still embedded in our existing fleet especially with the additional inventory that we’re adding over the next three years but like we did with natural habitat we continue to look at a lot of opportunities at any given moment to expand that growth profile to be frank we’re passing a lot of things mostly because they don’t fit with the echoes of what we do or we don’t think its sustainable long term growth opportunity for the company the pipeline today i would say is normal its nice robust compared to where it was a year ago and in order to complete it i think there’re several days that we’re looking at any given moment both from a fleet perspective as well as from a differential perspective and we’ll continue to explore those as they present themselves in most places operator operator instructions next question today comes from monica indiscernible with focus capital please go ahead unidentified analyst i just had one just to ask about the thinking behind your buyback specifically the split between the share buybacks and the warrant buybacks as i recall when you started buying back first few quarters you brought just warrants if you had specification of significant price appreciation in the stocks or warrants buyback would seem to be better being for the book in terms of saving share dilution in the future wondering whats going to taking the opportunity through most of the buyback on the shares craig felenstein sure so when we do our buyback we actually look at the intrinsic value of the launch at every individual share price so we compare the intrinsic value of one to the other and look at what the best value is at any given moment doesn’t mean that we will stop buying one versus the other it means that we’re just going to take advantage of the bigger opportunity at any given moment and that is why you’ve seen a little bit of shift from the warrants for the shares we are still happy to buyback warrants if they present themselves at the right price but we’re also going to compare that to what the share price is at any given time and that’s how we take a look at it unidentified analyst in q how many warrants are in hands of the sponsors craig felenstein i forget the exact number ill tell you when we get back to you with that number after the call okay operator and we are currently showing no further questions i’d like to turn the conference back over to mr craig felenstein for any closing remarks craig felenstein thank you everybody for

svenolof lindblad thanks craig and thank you everyone for joining us this morning i am delighted to have the opportunity to talk to you today about lindblad expeditions and we would like to take a few minutes to discuss the companys performance in  and some of the major events of the past year that shaped this financial result i will then spend some time devoted to the path ahead and why i frankly have never felt more confident about the longterm prospects of the company as i believe most of you know our reason to access public markets was to raise capital and a public currency so that we could capitalize on the growing opportunity we saw for the company to add capacity and make acquisitions to satisfy demand amongst our customers we also discussed at the time that adding capacity in our industry has a lead time and until the capacity came online our growth opportunities and levers were frankly limited while  was a year where we made significant progress in building our platform our management team and opportunities set for the future but we fell short of our initial financial plan for a number of reasons all of which we have discussed previously concerns over terrorism following the paris bombings and brussels terrorist attack the incessant drumbeat and concern over zika which began to diminish interest for a time in tropical areas that we trade a delay in timing of some of our marketing materials versus previous years interestingly given that our booking window is approximately nine months in duration these items had very little impact on the first half of  as we delivered  revenue growth but that was reflective of the booking strength we generated prior to november  we saw a significant slowdown in bookings towards the end of  and during the first four months of  from these issues which ultimately put pressure on the second half of the year we also had to cancel several voyages this past year most notably on the orion due to a significant engine malfunction nothing of this magnitude had ever happened in our companys history in fact i can count on one hand the number of incidents that have required the cancellation of multiple voyages and while there will be some shortterm financial ramifications craig will cover this of course we were able to mitigate the overall impact through insurance coverage and our marine team’s extremely efficient response and it should enable the vessel to return to normal operations in april  this year just next month i think it is important to know that we went out of our way to meet the needs of any guests who were inconvenienced in any fashion and the end result was continued confidence in the ability to deliver on our guest experience in fact over  of the cancelled guests on the five voyages have already rebooked for future expeditions despite all of the unique forces in  occupancy this past year did remain over  and we actually expanded our net yield slightly resisting as we always have a temptation of any meaningful discounting as a mechanism to buoy shortterm results we are fully committed to the longterm growth plans that you are all familiar with and will not erode our potential by engaging in these kinds of practices at the same time this past year we continued to strengthen the organization building both our infrastructure and human capital necessary to grow our business robustly and profitably in the longterm including solidifying our core executive team with craig felenstein as our cfo and phil auerbach as our cco chief commercial officer we also took several strategic steps this past year that we believe will further solidify the longterm growth prospects of the company through the investment in new capacity which will come online shortly and through closing an acquisition that is a great great compliment to our existing business we acquired natural habitat in may  and frankly couldn’t be more pleased with this acquisition natural habitat has already provided significant benefits and we have only just begun to explore the opportunities that each organization can provide for each other nat hab is fully dedicated to nature travel with a longstanding strategic alliance with the world wildlife fund they have a price point similar to us they provide an ability to offer landbased programs while keeping it in the family so to speak they provide the ability to crosssell our marine products to their audience they can grow with access to capital they previously didnt have and they have a solid management team that is able to operate effectively and autonomously without creating a distraction for our core team this was a highly strategic acquisition providing all of the above and meaningful diversification and as i sit here today i am more confident than i have ever have been that we will exceed our expectations from when we closed just  months ago as we go forward nat hab confirms our view that there are a number of highly accretive tuck in acquisition opportunities that could broaden our platform for our customer base while growing and enhancing the economic opportunities of our company we will continue to explore these opportunities as we focus on maximizing the potential of our existing operations and adding capacity whenever we are confident we can do so at compelling rates of return on that front we launched the endeavor ii in december replacing the original endeavor in the galapagos it was delivered on time and on budget bookings are strong and has been favorably adopted by traveling public and our industry partners the national geographic quest is on pace for delivery and for its maiden voyage on june  she is virtually sold out for the summer of  this is the most ambitious passenger vessel built in the united states in decades and when i visited the arctic a couple of weeks ago i was soundly impressed by the quality of work and i am very very excited by what it will do for our guests’ experience im actually quite proud that we were able to build this ship in the united states we are on pace for the sister ship of the quest the venture which will enter service in the second quarter of  and we are close to finalizing the shipyard for our blue water vessel scheduled for delivery in  we know that our decades of experience in expedition cruising and our deep understanding of what matters to our clientele will make this the most exciting and innovative expedition ship in the world we also saw significant booking growth in  following the softness in the beginning of the year in fact since april of  bookings for  and beyond have eclipsed the previous year each month with january and february beating  sales by  and as we are committed to robust growth we have also put focused effort on accelerating our capacity in marketing and sales this includes doubling our field sales force developing a variety of new partnerships reinvigorating our digital platform and our efforts in media there is no question that the story of lindblad expedition is worthy of public relations and we are making great strides in that arena i dont know if any of you saw cbs a couple of weeks ago cbs morning and evening news but there were several stories that were broadcast from our ship the national geographic explorer in the antarctic looking ahead we believe firmly that interest in the expedition category will only continue to expand given the complexity of both execution and the needs and wants of the expedition traveler there really is no substitute for experience in our  plus year history of expedition travel along with the valueadded longstanding partnership with national geographic provides both the ability and the credibility we believe is unmatched we intend to harvest the expanded interest in this category generated and use it to our advantage in summation  is off to an extremely good start in terms of sales in terms of fleet development and in terms of preparedness to deliver solid longterm results we are committed to being open to and unearthing opportunities that are brand appropriate and that will augment the core plan and we are extremely confident that we will meet our longterm financial goals as we enhance our preeminent position as leader in the maritime expedition travel sector let me now please let me turn the call over to craig to walk through our  performance and  financial outlook thank you craig felenstein thanks sven lindblad’s sustained focus on our core mission of providing unparalleled guest experiences enabled the company to once again deliver high occupancy rates in  while at the same time expanding our net yield to  per night despite the headwinds that were present earlier in the year and while the full year and fourth quarter financial results reflect some of the booking softness from the first half of  we finished the year with bookings ahead of  including over  growth in december versus the same month a year ago on a reported basis lindblad delivered revenue growth for the full year of  while adjusted ebitda declined  these results include contributions from natural habitat which was acquired during the second quarter of  the lindblad segment reported a  revenue decline primarily from lower other revenue for items such as airfare offers and trip extensions guest ticket revenues were flat yearonyear in the fourth quarter as increased rates were offset by slightly lower available guest nights primarily due to the national geographic planned repositioning during the third quarter which we talked about previously as well as from the translation of two voyages during the year to perform necessary repairs occupancy for the year remained over  but declined slightly from  primarily due to lower occupancy on the national geographic endeavour in anticipation of its retirement at the end of the year booking on its replacement the national geographic endeavour ii have been very strong and we expect to see significant growth in the galapagos in  the th anniversary of sven’s father’s first expedition to this amazing location full year adjusted ebitda at the lindblad segment declined by  primarily due to the lower revenue as well as a  increase in operating expenses adjusted net cruise costs on a per night basis increased  primarily due to higher personnel expenses and public company costs as we executed on our longterm growth plan cost of tours was also up slightly due to planned dry dock expenses and higher charter costs most notably from the addition of charter expeditions in cuba during december this was partially offset by a  reduction in fuel costs versus the prior year fuel cost for the year were  of revenue compared with  in  turning now to the fourth quarter on a reported basis lindblad delivered revenue growth of  or  million while adjusted ebitda declined  million excluding contributions from natural habitat the lindblad segment reported a  revenue decline primarily from lower occupancy in the fourth quarter as we mentioned on our last call this was anticipated due primarily to the retirement of the endeavour as well as to booking headwinds that we talked about during the early part of  the revenue in the quarter was also impacted by approximately  million from the unplanned cancellation of a voyage on the national geographic orion due to a significant engine repair as we indicated in our k filing earlier this year the engine repair will also impact the first quarter of  as we cancelled four additional voyages in the antarctica while the majority of the guests on the canceled voyages as sven mentioned have already rebooked with lindblad for travel in  or  we do still anticipate a  million or  million impact to revenue in  along with a  million to  million impact to ebitda the orion is scheduled to resume normal operations in europe in april of this year net yield in the fourth quarter was down in large part due to the lower occupancy that we just discussed as well as from the impact of canceling the orion’s antarctic voyage in december which typically garners higher yields fourth quarter adjusted ebitda at the lindblad segment declined by  million primarily due to the lower revenue as well as a  increase in operating expense adjusted net cruise costs on a per night basis increased  primarily due to higher personnel and marketing expenses as we executed on our longterm growth strategy cost of tours in the fourth quarter declined slightly versus the same period a year ago as lower fuel and dry dock expenses were partially offset by higher charter cost most notably as i mentioned from the addition of expeditions in cuba during december we also had reimbursement costs for guests that had changed travel plans due to the cancellation of the upcoming orion voyages fuel costs in the fourth quarter were  below prior year and  of revenue compared with  in the fourth quarter of  total company net income in the quarter was a loss of  million or  per share as compared to a loss of  million or  per share in the fourth quarter of  current quarter results include the lower operating results we just discussed as well as  million of other expenses primarily related to the loss on disposal of the endeavour we also had accelerated depreciation on the endeavour in anticipation of its retirement turning to our balance sheet we remain extremely well positioned to invest in future growth opportunities we ended the year with  million in unrestricted cash free cash flow for  was a use of  million including  million spent on the two new coastal vessels and  million on the endeavour ii excluding these items and looking at only maintenance capex free cash flow was  million in  given the strength of our balance sheet the confidence we have in our longterm growth opportunity and the belief that the company’s share and warrant prices are not reflective of the value of the company and our prospects we did repurchase over  million in shares and warrants during the fourth quarter under our  million stock and warrant repurchase plan this included nearly  shares of stock and over  warrants for the full year  we repurchased approximately  million in stock and warrants and as of march  we have approximately  million remaining under the existing plan it is really important to note that our first priority for capital allocation is investing in our existing business and external growth opportunities that will enhance our longterm growth profile turning to the full year  the lindblad segment is currently pacing over  million ahead of the same point a year ago despite the voyage cancellations on the orion this is primarily due to the additional inventory from the anticipated launch of the national geographic quest in june and from additional charter expeditions in cuba in  we are currently at  of our full year projected ticket revenues for  including the additional inventory versus  of the  full year ticket revenue at the same time a year ago factoring in the current operating environment the impact of the orion cancellations and anticipated contributions from natural habitat we expect total company tour revenue in  between  million to  million that would be  to  growth versus  we expect adjusted ebitda between  million to  million or  to  growth versus  and as sven mentioned this is very important we also remain firmly on track to meet the longterm financial objectives that were laid out when the company went public in  please note that these expectations are for the current expectations for the first quarter are to be down yearonyear due to the impact of the orion cancellations while q and q results were benefited from the launch of the national geographic quest similarly  the majority of our dry dock timing in the upcoming year is planned for the second and fourth quarter additionally as i mentioned last quarter please note that natural habitat has seasonality to their results with the significant portion of their revenue in the second half of the year and the majority of their annual adjusted ebitda typically recognized during the fourth quarter thanks for your time this morning and now sven and i will be happy to answer any question that you may have questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instruction todays first question comes from greg badishkanian of citi please go ahead unidentified analyst hi guys this is actually fred whiteman on for greg i was just hoping you could rationalize sort of walk us through i think you said you were  booked for  versus  last year i know that you gave some figures on the prepared remarks about recent trends i think you said january and february were up and december was up  could you sort of bridge those two numbers along some of the stronger recent commentary that you outlined craig felenstein sure so the real key for  in terms of where we are versus  is that we have a significant amount of additional inventory in  and that really is predominately due to two items the first is the launch of the national geographic quest which will launch at the end of june of the current year so that will provide us with significant amount of capacity and inventory in  and we also have additional voyages on our charters in cuba in  in the current year of  we only had about one month in december and in  we will have the cuba expeditions for the first three months as well as december for this year so i think thats the first thing and the second thing that i would talk to is that the booking trends have as sven mentioned been really strong since april of the last year since that point we have seen yearonyear growth in every single month since that point that growth has continued in the early part of this year in january and february and as of today we are not seeing any sign of slowing down obviously we will keep you guys updated on how we are doing as the year progresses but right now we feel very confident about our ability to reach our financial targets for the fullyear unidentified analyst okay that makes sense and then if you look around the overall industry we have seen some improving trends for north america source business to europe is that sort of consistent with what you guys are seeing relative to just i know you have a longer booking window but should that benefit yearoveryear craig felenstein so what we did for  based on what happened in  what we are seeing in  we reduced our inventory in continental and southern europe we did not know how long the effects would last of the sort of downward pressure in europe and we moved the orion in particular more into the northern parts sort of the arctic and sub artic parts of europe and so the balance between the two having reduced the inventory in continental europe and the migration further north has turned out to be a good combination of inventory and in general as europe from everything i have heard in the industry the interest in europe is certainly increasing over what it was in  where there was a huge amount of downward pressure unidentified analyst okay great then just one last one could you just talk about the early feedback from the cuba itineraries svenolof lindblad the early feedback from the cuba itineraries has been frankly mixed cuba is a complex country to operate in i believe weve had a very strong on the ground presence our own presence working with the cubans too and with the folks we have chartered the ship from to operate there it has been a lot of work but that the level of work is diminishing as we sort of get our arms around the realities of the system if you will which is inconsistent at best and needs a lot of focus in order to keep it arm tracked but we feel good about it it is not to be underestimated that working there is complex unidentified analyst okay great thank you operator operator instruction todays next question comes from chris woronka of deutsche bank please go ahead chris woronka hey good morning guys i wanted to ask you on that data point you gave out on the  million being ahead of  million on bookings is that if we kind of normalized that and we took out quest cuba and orion and kind of looked at maybe samestore thats possible with that would that number still be positive or would it be closer flat craig felenstein hi this is craig thanks for question chris its a hard question to answer because obviously the guess that are both on those vessels may have opted for some of our other itineraries if they had decided to travel with us but just from a pure math perspective if you take out the out of that you just mentioned you probably would be pretty close to where you were at the same point a year ago and actually a new factor in thats for when you factor in quest if you factor in the orion we certainly would be ahead so that the cancellation on orion certainly had presented a headwind for us looking at  and if you if the orion hadnt happened and you didnt have the quest and you didnt have cuba you would still be ahead but thats obviously a lot of conjecture into that statement chris woronka sure understood and then on that have  this will be your first fullyear of ownership can you maybe give us a little color on where you are in terms of some of this thing i know they are operating pretty autonomously but in terms of some of the things you guys are benefits you guys are thinking of taking up kind of where are you in that process and what do you how do you see that unfolding this year svenolof lindblad so one of the things that we believed would be the case and has proven out is that our traveler and that expeditions traveler and the nat hab traveler are very similar types of people and they have a great and strong allegiance to the companys they do business with and so we have found that the ability to cross sell has been increasing in terms of those results and we really havent yet made that effort fully but we intent to accelerate that effort this year because we are doing a multitude of tests on their side and on our side to see what the response was about this concept of cross over so our travelers actually quite omnivorous from the perspective of this isnt the only kind of travel they do and so they do like to take as far as they do like to do things that are different in the nature space and so this is proven to be i think advantageous because now when a traveler of ours wants to go to east africa lets say on a safari they go with nat hab and all likelihood rather than somebody else and so it keeps it hence the term keeping it in the family so that is a primary benefit also we are going to be developing landbased programs that we will more aggressively offer our past guest audience under our brand in order to expand that net interest so its a there is a bit of learning curve about adaption between two companies that have very loyal customers followings but the key is that the inclinations or the interest and the economics are rather similar craig felenstein and just to add to that we are also very fortunate that nat hab has some great ideas through ben bressler the founder and ceo are now in a position where we are able to fund some of those capital expenditures so we have a rigorous program overview of those capital expenditures but we are also able to take advantage of accelerating their growth so there are some exciting ideas coming up with regard to potential for that business in its own right and we are excited by those opportunities because there will be crossover as sven mentioned chris woronka great thanks thats helpful i guess just one more for craig i suppose well craig what are you thinking in terms of oil and kind of fx baked into the guidance craig felenstein sure so from a fuel perspective we are expecting there would be an increase in  versus  we are not going to talk specifically about how much we assume but obviously given where prices are today we dont expect them to stay at these low levels hopefully they do and that will be a opportunity for us but we certainly dont anticipate that being the case throughout  so on the fuel front thats where we are on the fx front i think its important to know that the majority of our revenue the vast majority of our revenue is actually in us dollars so there really is not any large impact to revenues from the currency perspective on the cost side about  plus of our cost are also in us dollar there is some cost in euros that obviously is susceptible to any foreign currency fluctuations but given the amount of impact that we see from us dollar revenue of the cost we dont bake in any kind of currency fluctuations into our forward looking expectations chris woronka okay very good thanks guys operator and ladies and gentlemen this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to the management team for any final remarks svenolof lindblad thank you everybody for joining us today we appreciate your time and if you have any followup questions please
