million in private equity and government funding industrial market for graphene applications the thinnest material known to science graphene is also surprisingly the strongest material ever measured the carbonbased super material is the most impermeable material on earth it is highly flexible incredibly light and energy efficient with record thermal and electrical conductivity these unique qualities make it a perfect material for a wide range of industrialscale applications for the automotive energy plasticspolymers aerospace and medical sectors in addition to water treatment computing and electronics sectors key applications for graphene include batteries fuel cells solar panelscells electrochemical capacitors automotive bumpers smartphone screens led lighting medical devices and d printing materials the graphene market is expected to expand dramatically after  with a  percent compound annual growth rate between  and  globally more than  major corporations across europe north america and asia are investing billions of dollars in graphene rd as they compete for a major role in the commercialization of this strategically important material the successful commercialization of graphene depends on three primary factors unlimited access to a secure source of highgrade highquality graphite ability to produce near pristine graphene on an economically scalable basis and building strategic partnerships with the right players to develop the right applications grafoid excels in all three of these areas and is advancing toward commercialization “the key vendors dominating this graphene market space are basf grafoid inc ibm corp and samsung electronics co” – global graphene markets  infiniti research limited october  secure source offtake agreements with focus graphite grafoid largest shareholder  million grafoid common shares is focus graphite inc tsxvfms an advanced stage graphite mining company heading towards production at its lac knife graphite project located in québec canada lac knife one of the highestgrade flake graphite deposits in the world hosts a measured and indicated mineral resource estimate of  million tonnes grading  percent graphitic carbon as natural flake graphite with an additional inferred mineral resource estimate of  million tonnes grading  percent graphitic carbon conductivity test findings in march  demonstrated that using lac knife graphite in both the anodes and cathodes of lithiumion batteries enhanced overall battery efficiencies including increased power higher capacity longer battery life and increased utilization of cathode active materials leaving focus graphite well positioned to compete internationally focus graphite’s proprietary process has also purified fine flake graphite sourced at lac knife to a  percent purity making it ideal for the next generation of lithiumion batteries the highpurity graphite concentrate produced from lac knife graphite makes it ideallysuited for grafoid’s mesograf™ onestep production process in june  grafoid and focus graphite signed two industryfirst offtake agreements the first offtake agreement dubbed the “graphene offtake” commits grafoid to acquire up to a maximum of  tonnes of highpurity large flake graphite concentrate annually for  years the graphene offtake will supply grafoid with materials for a range of nextgeneration graphenebased batteries automotive and consumer electronics and energy storage applications the second offtake agreement the “polymer offtake” commits grafoid to acquire up to  tonnes of highpurity graphite concentrate annually for  years the polymer offtake will supply grafoid with material for a range of graphitebased polymer applications for the automotive and aerospace industry the patented graphitepolymer process for fabricating such applications was developed by grafoid’s wholly owned subsidiary graflow inc in partnership with rutgers university’s advanced polymer materials school of engineering amipp economically scalable process patent onestep production for mesograf™ in may  grafoid unveiled its unique graphitetomesograf™ processing technology for which it controls the exclusive global license codeveloped by grafoid’s president chief technology officer and founding partner gordon chiu mesograf™ production involves a unique onestep environmentally sustainable process that extracts atomthin graphene sheets directly from graphite ore the high costs associated with complex energyintensive production processes have been a major obstacle for the largescale adoption of graphene traditional methods of producing graphene involve timeconsuming stages harsh chemicals and high costs grafoid’s onestep process eliminates unnecessary energyconsuming steps to create lowcost graphene products that can be tailored to specific industrial commercial military biomedical and humanitarian applications “the graphene market depends on the development of applications that involve combining graphene with other materials to improve and evolve technology” explained chester burtt grafoid’s director of communications and government affairs “the market will not move forward without these applications but production must be economical or it will never be adopted by business our process for developing graphenebased products is very cost effective compared to the traditional costly processes that involve the use of harsh chemicals that don’t lend themselves to quick production as our process does” this distinction is what makes mesograf™ a gamechanger providing companies with a lowcost highpurity graphene material for use in a wide variety of products grafoid’s ability to produce highquality graphene suitable for diverse applications means the company doesn’t depend on the success of one niche industry and can generate revenue from every sector core attributes of mesograf™ low cost—the simple nature of the mesograf™ production process has the potential to position grafoid as the lowestcost producer of graphene high purity—the mesograf™ proprietary process produces near pristine condition graphene that retains its inherent highenergy density and physical integrity high yield—graphene yields resulting from mesograf’s onestep production process are  percent greater than traditional extraction methods scalable—grafoid can produce mesograf™ on a scalable production basis guaranteeing largescale supply is critical for commercial and industrial graphene applications versatile—mesograf™ has the potential to be adapted to the broadest possible range of industrial and consumer product applications environmentally sustainable—the separation agents used in the mesograf™ process create a reaction that is safe and nontoxic strong acids are avoided reaction agents are recyclable and the chemistry is nonoxidative and nonexplosive grafoid global technology centre mesograf™ is the world’s first trademarked graphene and is produced by grafoid at its stateoftheart technology rd facility the grafoid global technology centre ggtc located in kingston ontario canada the worldclass facility is the first of its kind in north america and also hosts production
