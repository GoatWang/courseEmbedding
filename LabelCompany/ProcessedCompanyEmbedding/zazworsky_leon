deener  landrum  shouse llp leon zazworsky official defendant represented by elizabeth anna deener  landrum  shouse llp  larry c deener  landrum  shouse llp memorandum opinion  order david l bunning district judge this matter initially came before the court on plaintiffs motion to remand doc   the court denied that motion but also ordered the parties to file simultaneous memoranda addressing colorado river abstention doc   that briefing having now been completed docs    the court concludes that abstention is appropriate accordingly this case will be stayed pending resolution of the state court action i background the court adopts the facts and procedural history set forth in its previous order to summarize sanjeev krishna thakur commenced two lawsuits on behalf of himself his wife and his minor son in boone county circuit court based upon an automobile accident in which sonali sisodia was killed and ast was injured in the first suit he named eight defendants including mid state systems inc and james konkler in the second suit which is the case actually before this court thakur again named mid state systems and konkler as well as leon zazworsky he then moved to consolidate the two suits before the kentucky court could adjudicate thakurs motion for consolidation zazworsky along with mid state systems and konkler removed this second suit and a motion to remand followed the court denied that motion but requested further briefing addressing whether the court should abstain and stay all proceedings in light of colorado river water conservation dist v u s  us   the parties completed that briefing on august   docs    ii analysis as the sixth circuit noted in painewebber inc v cohen in certain exceptional circumstances    a federal district court may abstain from exercising its subject matter jurisdiction due to the existence of a concurrent state court proceeding based on considerations of wise judicial administration giving regard to conservation of judicial resources and comprehensive disposition of litigation  fd   th cir  quoting colorado river water  us at  the appellate court continued the supreme court has identified eight factors four in colorado river and four in subsequent decisions that a district court must consider when deciding whether to abstain from exercising its jurisdiction due to the concurrent jurisdiction of a state court these considerations are  whether the state court has assumed jurisdiction over any res or property  whether the federal forum is less convenient to the parties  avoidance of piecemeal litigation    the order in which jurisdiction was obtained     whether the source of governing law is state or federal  the adequacy of the state court action to protect the federal plaintiffs rights  the relative progress of the state and federal proceedings and  the presence or absence of concurrent jurisdiction id citation omitted to summarize there are two basic steps that must be completed by the district court in determining whether colorado river abstention is appropriate first the district court must    determine that the concurrent state and federal actions are actually parallel romine v compuserve corp  fd   th cir  if the proceedings are parallel the court must then apply the multifactor balancing test set forth initially in colorado river and expanded by later case law a parallel state court proceeding as noted a necessary requirement for application of the colorado river doctrine   is the presence of a parallel state proceeding crawley v hamilton cnty commrs  fd   th cir  exact parallelism is not required it is enough if the two proceedings are substantially similar romine  fd at  citations and internal quotation marks omitted in romine the sixth circuit held that two proceedings are substantially similar when the parties are substantially similar although not identical and the claims against the defendants are predicated on the same allegations as to the same material facts id citations omitted the two suits discussed herein are substantially similar defendants cannot seriously dispute that the parties in the first suit are substantially similar to those in the second moreover the claims against mid state systems and konkler in the state court action are almost identical to the claims against mid state systems konkler and zazworsky in this case all of which are based upon the april   automobile accident this is the very reason thakur moved to consolidate the two suits because the two suits are substantially similar the court can and will turn to the multifactor balancing test one issue though deserves brief comment although not raised by the parties a line of district court cases assert that proceedings are not considered parallel if there is an issue that would not be resolved by the state court upon the completion of the state court action see kopacz v hopkinsville surface  storm water util  fsuppd   wd ky  holley performance products inc v tucows inc no cv  wl  at  wd ky apr   brandenburg tel co v sprint commcns co lp no cv  wl  at  wd ky apr   eon us servs inc v qsc painting inc no civa jbc  wl  at  ed ky aug   pnc bank nat assn v pers no civ a c  wl  at  wd ky may   however as pointed out by united states district court for the eastern district of michigan this assertion    has not been adopted by the sixth circuit doe v ann arbor pub sch no   wl  at  ed mich apr   b multifactor balancing test as noted determining the existence of exceptional circumstances justifying abstention requires consideration of the following eight factors  whether the state court has assumed jurisdiction over any res or property  whether the federal forum is less convenient to the parties  avoidance of piecemeal litigation  the order in which jurisdiction was obtained  whether the source of governing law is state or federal  the adequacy of the state court action to protect the federal plaintiffs rights  the relative progress of the state and federal proceedings  the presence or absence of concurrent jurisdiction however no one factor is necessarily determinative a carefully considered judgment taking into account both the obligation to exercise jurisdiction and the combination of factors counseling against that exercise is required only the clearest of justifications will warrant a stay colorado river  us at  citation omitted in other words the decision whether to stay a federal action because of parallel statecourt litigation does not rest on a mechanical checklist but on a careful balancing of the important factors as they apply in a given case with the balance heavily weighted in favor of the exercise of jurisdiction the weight to be given to any one factor may vary greatly from case to case depending on the particular setting of the case moses h cone meml hosp v mercury const corp  us    the first and second factors weigh against abstention neither court has assumed jurisdiction over any res or property romine  fd at  noting that where no property is at issue the first factor is inapposite and supports exercising jurisdiction and the federal forum in covington is no less convenient to the parties than the boone circuit court in burlington id concluding that the second factor supports jurisdiction where the courthouses in which the actions are pending are both located in the same city the third factoravoidance of piecemeal litigationweighs heavily in favor of abstention piecemeal litigation occurs when different courts adjudicate the identical issue thereby duplicating judicial effort and potentially rendering conflicting results id citation omitted the issues to be decided by the state court and this court are largely identical in fact the allegations and attendant claims made by thakur against mid state systems and konkler in the two suits are almost exactly the same with the primary difference being the additional allegations against zazworsky in the second suit doc   at   this is also true with respect to the relief requested id at     which brings to mind the sixth circuits closing thought regarding the dangers of piecemeal litigation in romine when a case proceeds on parallel tracks in state and federal court the threat to efficient adjudication is selfevident but judicial economy is not the only value that is placed in jeopardy the legitimacy of the court system in the eyes of the public and fairness to the individual litigants also are endangered by duplicative suits that are the product of gamemanship or that result in conflicting adjudications  fd at  quoting lumen const inc v brant const co inc  fd   th cir  fourth the order in which jurisdiction was obtained also weighs heavily in favor of abstention this factor is closely tied with the seventh factorthe relative progress of the state and federal proceedingsbecause priority should not be measured exclusively by which complaint was filed first but rather in terms of how much progress has been made in the two actions moses h cone meml hosp  us at  here the first suit was commenced on august   while this second suit was removed approximately nine months on may   more importantly the state court record reflects that written discovery has been exchanged and depositions have been noticed doc   and thakur represents that some claims have been settled and depositions have been taken doc   at  conversely no real progress has been made in this case because this case clearly rests on state law the fifth factor heavily favors abstention this courts jurisdiction over thakurs claims against mid state systems konkler and zazworsky is based on diversity jurisdiction under  usc §  there are no federal issues to be decided turning to the remaining two factors the sixth and the eighth the state court proceedings would be adequate to protect the rights of plaintiffs especially considering that thakur has requested abstention doc   at  and the presence of concurrent jurisdiction only marginally if at all favors abstention cohen  fd at  more factors then weigh towards abstention this case will therefore be stayed until the state court action is complete iii conclusion accordingly for the reasons state herein it is ordered that all proceedings in this action shall be stayed pending the resolution of the parallel state court proceedings the parties shall notify the court when those proceedings are resolved footnotes  the other defendants were hermendra patel rachel m greba goodyear tire  rubber company progressive advanced insurance company wingfoot commercial tire systems llc and kentucky farm bureau mutual insurance company  defendants sole argument concerning parallelism is that it was thakurs choice to file a separate and independent action against a diverse
