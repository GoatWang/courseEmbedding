process management asiapacificmichael h train assumed office as the president of emerson process management asiapacific in  where he has been a significant contributor for emerson over the past fifteen years he shares his considerable experience of the region with ce asia   april          by admin ce asia how has the process automation business in asia pacific changed over the years train i have witnessed a significant amount of change in the process automation industry over the  years i have observed the asia pacific marketplace since the advent of digital approaches to control at the turn of millennium automation has changed continuously to help process companies improve output lower costs and make their plants easier and safer to operate emerson’s plantweb digital architecture with process automation and asset optimization functionality is an example of innovative technology that has led the industry transformation faced with the challenge of a lesser experienced workforce and the need to achieve worldclass performance new facilities in emerging markets in asia pacific are receptive to new technology and want the best proven technology to build worldclass plants they look for long term commitment from vendors with nearby engineering skills and support capabilities they look to the automation companies to help them move faster up the learning curve the trend towards appointing a main automation contractor mac or a main instrument vendor miv has helped customers complete projects in record speed with reduced risks and better quality the plants being built in asiapacific today are world class in terms of capacity uptime and availability and capability for data and decision analysis if you look to mature markets you find a different situation that is equally challenging aging plants with older technology are run by a shrinking workforce and these facilities must compete in a global marketplace with the newer plants it is estimated that billion worth of automation installed around the world needs to be updated to stay competitive with probably  percent of this installed in the greater asiapacific region these customers need new technology and support services that can help them advance and be competitive in the coming years ce asia to what do you credit emerson’s success in the booming china power generation industry train emerson has earned a leading automation position in the power industry in china that is estimated at over  million annually several projects have been awarded to emerson three of which are the digital automation of the zouxian ×mw huaneng yuhuan ×mw and datang ningde xmw power plants we are able to secure these orders because customers have shown a strong interest in our systems  field devices local engineering project management capabilities and longterm commitment china’s power generation industry is adopting emerson’s plantweb approach that deploys fieldbus communications technology to network intelligent field devices with the ovation expert control system and ams suite asset management software our field instruments are recognized leaders including the rosemount  pressure transmitter with world’s largest installations in china for our valves offering in china we have leveraged over  years of experience and expertise in the japanese power industry and have developed world class manufacturing and support of china’s power plant infrastructure another major force behind emerson’ success has been a judicious focus on engineering and project management capabilities emerson has concentrated on people practices including the ability to quickly assimilate a worldclass team transfer best practices and internalize and leverage the learning experience our ability to help customers save on implementation costs and deliver outstanding project success has ensured a leadership position for emerson process management in china’s power generation industry ce asia what are your plans for emerson process management asiapacific in the coming years train i still see plenty of opportunity for us to improve and deliver more value to our customers in the region it is clear in my mind that the asiapacific market will surpass other regions of the world to become the largest process automation market and i am working to build emerson process management as the leader in supporting and serving this market for the long term emerson is focused on bringing more skilled and experienced human resources to the process automation industry one that i believe is exciting for young people to consider for their career we are also working to enhance our technologies for the long term including a consistent investment in our plantweb digital plant architecture products and services my hope is to see us double our emerson business again in the coming five years and be the automation provider of choice by process manufacturers in leading our organization toward this result i emphasize the honor of our being selected for major projects and the need to remain humble and focused on continuing to find new ways to deliver value to our customers and help them continue to succeed in their businesses the large asiapacific investment in greenfield projects will continue for some time with china and india leading the way however i am very interested in developing more modernization capabilities for our existing site customers and making it easier for them to incorporate these newer technologies in their facilities this is a major challenge for customers and suppliers alike and we will need to work together closely to help deliver these benefits relatedlatest issue view latest issue online download ebook subscribe magazine now trendingmobike and gemalto
