asst u s atty also entered an appearance for appellee before mcgowan leventhal and robb circuit judges robb circuit judge the appellant was indicted in fifteen counts counts one two and three charged fraud by wire  usc §  counts four and five mail fraud  usc §  count six interstate transportation of a check taken by fraud  usc §  and counts seven through fifteen larceny after trust  dccode §  a jury acquitted the appellant on the first six counts but found him guilty on the nine counts charging larceny after trust in that he fraudulently converted to his own use  entrusted to him by the american province of the sisters of the divine savior he was sentenced to imprisonment for not less than three nor more than nine years on each count the sentences to run concurrently  all of the offenses charged in the indictment were alleged to have occurred in  in that year and for some years before the appellant was a lawyer and real estate man with offices in the district of columbia the charges against him had their origin in certain transactions between him and the american province of the sisters of the divine savior this organization a nonprofit corporation was a religious order devoted to nursing teaching and all forms of charitable work the projects of the order were financed by the salaries of the sisters by donations and at times by borrowing of public funds the sisters public borrowing led to a meeting in may  between the provincial superior of the order mother aquin gilles and the appellant the meeting was arranged by representatives of the superior generalate the orders parent organization as a result the appellant who was experienced in the financing of religious organizations and was well known to the superior generalate arranged a refinancing of the debts of the american province the refinancing was accomplished through a public bond issue underwritten by keenan  clarey a minneapolis firm specializing in the underwriting of unsecured bonds of religious organizations the appellant acted as attorney for the sisters in this matter but was not compensated for his services mother aquin testified that on one occasion when she mentioned compensation the appellant said he would not accept any fees that he wanted to do this for the sisters and i never again asked him to remunerate him for his services having arranged refinancing for the sisters in the fall of  the appellant continued as their legal counsel and financial advisor they discussed with him a desire to replace or remodel a hospital in wausau wisconsin and a nursing home at portage which they maintained this discussion led to a suggestion by the appellant that the necessary funds be obtained through a bond issue to be arranged through keenan  clarey mother aquin testified that on or about may   after many discussions    i met with mr orsinger and at that meeting the crystallized form of our proposals were put together and those proposals included taking out a bond issue in the amount of two and a half million dollars of public funds through keenan and clarey and one million dollars of that amount of money would be put in a reserve fund to begin work on wausau and portage at such time as we were able to begin and one million and a half was to be entrusted to victor j orsinger for the purpose of assembling a block of property in the marquette university area on which the sisters of the divine savior would build a house of studies for our young sisters       the proposal was made that it  was to be entrusted to mr orsinger through his attorney account and then through that into parkwood out of which it would be disbursed for the purpose of assembling a block in the marquette area          the sisters of the divine savior had entrusted i mean were entrusting one and a half million dollars to victor j orsinger on his own word it was to be paid into his attorney account and then through parkwood incorporated he would buy this block    but we were not giving it to parkwood as parkwood we were giving it we were entrusting it to mr orsinger for this assembly of the block for us    parkwood referred to by mother aquin was parkwood incorporated a real estate investment and holding company entirely owned by the appellant mother aquin testified further that in their meeting in may  the appellant advised the sisters to acquire an entire block rather than the onethird of a block needed for their project so that the part not used by the sisters would not be used then for any purpose incompatible with a house of studies in this area the appellant estimated that it would take about two years to assemble the entire block and according to mother aquin he represented that the sisters at the end of the twoyear period would receive onethird of the block back from mr orsinger and the  that we had entrusted to him for the purchase of the property the onethird to be free and clear of all mortgages and encumbrances the appellant wrote out a summary of his proposal which included the statement with respect to the disposition of the funds he was to receive  to victor j orsinger for purchase of marquette univ area block to be secured by mortgage on land purchased  interest for year i e  for  years deposited in escrow in beginning about a week later around may   the appellant telephoned mother aquin and suggested that the bond issue be raised to  and that the extra  would be a temporary loan for a sic generalate in rome and that would be repaid for us from a bond issue that the generalate would take out later the appellants suggestion was adopted and the amount of the bond issue was increased to  early in june the appellant went to milwaukee to discuss the proposed bond issue and purchase of land at this time he asked mother aquin if we would give him a  advance payment so that he could begin the assembly of the block near marquette on june   mother aquin sent the appellant her organizations check for  with a covering letter describing it as the check of  as advance payment of money needed for the project in the marquette area the check was payable to the order of victor j orsinger attorney and was endorsed by him and deposited in the account of parkwood incorporated by letter dated june   he acknowledged receipt of the  advance payment sent by you today as part of the  required for the marquette area project on the same day june   orsinger wrote to mother olympia superior general of the sisters of the divine savior in rome referring to the arrangements for a  loan and the disposition of the funds raised he said  will go to orsinger for purchase of land for the juniorate near marquette university orsinger will pay the entire cost of this bond issue for two years namely  a year the details of our memorandum of may   have not been changed except to raise the amount from  to        simply stated cf memorandum may   the sisters will receive the land they need for the juniorate in block no  free and clear at no cost plus their  back at the end of two years and i would retain the rest of the land in the block noting that  of the borrowed funds would go to rome he added you should receive your  some time around august   since i am paying the interest costs on this  also do you think this  would take the place of the principal i am supposed to send you in  cf my memorandum of january   it appeared that the appellant was heavily indebted to the organization in rome and that substantial payments on his loan were due in  on june   the sisters and orsinger executed a memorandum of agreement prepared by orsinger mother aquin signed for the sisters and orsinger signed as victor j orsinger attorney and victor j orsinger president of parkwood incorporated the agreement recited that the sisters have decided to borrow three million dollars that orsinger as special legal counsel to the sisters for this purpose has assisted the sisters in arranging this borrowing that parkwood is a real estate corporation all of whose common stock is owned by orsinger and that the agreement was intended to be a convenient memorandum of the purposes and dispositions of the borrowed funds the agreement provided for the disbursement of the  borrowed by the sisters at  interest as follows a  to victor j orsinger attorney for the purposes described herein b  to the general council sisters of the divine savior rome as a temporary loan to be repaid out of  borrowings of the general council or from other sources c  to the sisters as a reserve fund which may be reinvested by the sisters pending commencement of new building projects in milwaukee wausau and portage for his part orsinger agreed to exert his best efforts and skills to purchase in his own name or in corporations owned and controlled by him ground in milwaukee for the sisters juniorate residence the agreement further provided for recordkeeping and taxaccounting purposes the aboverecited  shall be paid to the account of victor j orsinger attorney and he shall then disburse it through parkwood incorporated as required therefore parkwood incorporated shall issue its promissory note for  due within two years as security for the purposes recited here which note shall provide for the prompt payment in semiannual installments of interest at the rate of ten per cent  per annum that is one hundred fifty thousand dollars  each year while the said note is unpaid and outstanding so that the total interest charge on the entire three million dollars  loan shall be paid from the above interest payments made by parkwood and further that parkwood shall reserve such interest in advance by segregating and depositing from its funds the sum of three hundred thousand dollars  in a national bank so that the interest payments will be available when due orsinger also agreed to pay twothirds of the expenses incident to the placement of the  loan these expenses being estimated at  so that orsingers share was  he further agreed that he would charge no legal fee or make any claim for expenses in connection with the placement of the loan or the purchase of the land  page contained footnotes the sisters public offering was made on july   on july  they transferred  from their account in milwaukee to the account of victor j orsinger attorney in the maryland national bank on july  mother aquin sent the appellant the sisters check for  drawn to the order of mr victor j orsinger attorney in her covering letter she specified that the money was to be used for the project in the marquette area the total of these two checks together with the  advance previously sent to the appellant and  the appellants share of expenses of the public offering is  in accordance with the agreement of june   that parkwood incorporated shall issue its promissory note for  due within two years as security for the purposes recited here the appellant gave the sisters parkwoods note for  signed by him as president the note payable on or before two years after its date of july   carried interest at the rate of  per year it provided the maker hereof agrees to segregate and deposit from its funds a sum equal to the total interest due on this obligation until maturity and such separate fund although invested in government bonds or bank time deposits or cash shall be diminished in proportion to and only as the interest payments required by this note are made the  received from the sisters by the appellant and deposited in his attorney account was promptly transferred to the account of parkwood or one of its whollyowned subsidiaries the money was then used to meet various obligations of the appellant and his companies by the end of august there was only  in cash left in the victor j orsinger attorney account and a  cash balance in the parkwood accounts during this period however disbursements for the acquisition of the marquette property amounted to only  no money was escrowed or segregated for the payment of interest to the sisters the record discloses that when he was dealing with the sisters in  the appellant and his corporations were in financial difficulties payments on loans and mortgages were delinquent and the appellant was struggling without success to obtain additional financing through commercial loans the proof is that the appellant used the money obtained from the sisters to meet these pressing obligations subsequently he began the acquisition of the marquette block with borrowed funds from other sources by the end of  seventeen properties were under contract out of a total of twentyone properties in the block by the end of  twenty properties had been acquired or were under contract by the end of  the total cost of the property which had been acquired was  including real estate taxes but the net cash outlay by parkwood totaled only  without telling the sisters the appellant had mortgaged the property for  and all except  of this money was used for the general operations of parkwood in july  officers of the securities and exchange commission went to milwaukee in connection with an investigation of the sale of church notes which had been sold as a result of an offering prepared by the appellant at the same time the appellant as attorney for the sisters appeared in milwaukee to review the progress being made on the acquisition of the marquette property the agreement of june   provided for such a review mother aquin testified that at this meeting mr orsinger presented a modification of agreement that in view of the fact that all was proceeding as we had expected that he would like to remove the money that had been kept in escrow to pay the interest as it came due the modification presented by the appellant provided that the sisters waive the requirement that interest payments be placed in escrow mother aquin signed the modification agreement and the appellant signed as president of parkwood and as victor j orsinger attorney in fact as the appellant knew but did not disclose to mother aquin he had never placed in escrow the money required for the payment of interest mother aquin did not learn until december  that the appellant had mortgaged the marquette block at that time she asked the appellant if there were any mortgages placed on the property and i was told that there were two mortgages placed on the property there in the amount between  and  and this was a very great surprise to me she testified that the appellant explained that money had been set aside in a trust company in milwaukee and that there was no need to worry about the costs the payments would be made on it when they came due in fact the mortgages exceeded  and only a small amount had been escrowed for payment although a total of  in interest was paid to the sisters through march   they did not receive  on july   parkwood was placed into insolvency proceedings in march  and into bankruptcy in june  parkwood defaulted on the loans secured by mortgages on the marquette block and judgments were obtained by the mortgagee ii the appellant argued in the district court that he was entitled to a judgment of acquittal upon the ground that there was no evidence that the sisters entrusted their money to him for the purpose of applying the same for the use and benefit of the sisters within the meaning of the statute defining larceny after trust dccode  §  specifically the appellant argued that the proof was that he borrowed the  from the sisters giving them an interestbearing promissory note and thereby establishing a relationship of debtor and creditor rather than one of trust that as a borrower he had the right to use the money for his own purposes cf fulton v united states  appdc   he pointed to the fact that entries in the sisters books and a proof of claim submitted on their behalf in the reorganization proceedings referred to the note as evidence of an obligation due to the sisters the appellant repeats these arguments in this court the district court was not persuaded and neither are we whether a transaction creates a trust relationship or that of debtor and creditor depends upon all of the facts and circumstances including the intention of the parties the fact that interest is to be paid is of course evidence that a debt is created as distinguished from a trust obligation but it is not conclusive there may be evidence that justifies a jury in finding that notwithstanding the payment of interest the recipient of the money held it in trust commonwealth v snow  mass   ne   people v pierce  cal app d   pd   stecher v state  wis   nw   mcglynn v schultz  njsuper   ad   here mother aquin representing the sisters testified that in her discussions with the appellant he proposed that the sisters entrust him with  for the purpose of assembling the marquette block there was no discussion of a loan or any mention of a loan by mother aquin or the appellant on the contrary it was mother aquins clear understanding and intention that the money was to be entrusted to the appellant for the sole purpose of purchasing land the appellant asked for a  advance payment so that he could begin the assembly of the block and he acknowledged receipt of this money as part of the  required for the marquette area project on the same day he wrote to the superior general of the sisters stating that  will go to orsinger for purchase of land for the juniorate near marquette university the memorandum of agreement executed by the sisters and the appellant on june   provided that  would go to victor j orsinger attorney for the purposes described herein and that for recordkeeping and taxaccounting purposes the aboverecited  shall be paid to the account of victor j orsinger attorney and he shall then disburse it through parkwood incorporated as required it is plain that the purposes described were the purchase of land in the marquette block and that the disbursements required were disbursements for such purposes and not for the private purposes of the appellant consistently with this interpretation mother aquin when she sent the appellant the sisters check for  on july   specified that the money was to be used for the project in the marquette area again the appellant on cross examination admitted that on may   in discussing his application for a loan from the maryland national bank he told a representative of the bank mr darnielle that as counsel for the sisters he was about to receive  from them that this money was for the purchase of certain properties in milwaukee that he proposed to place  of the money in a certificate of deposit at the maryland national bank and that the balance of  would remain in a checking account to be gradually disbursed as the properties were assembled in milwaukee the appellant argues that the existence of a promissory note and his payment of interest negative the existence of a trust relationship between him and the sisters and establish that the relationship was that of debtor and creditor as we have said the existence of a promissory note and the payment of interest are not conclusive on this point the jury was required to weigh the significance of the interestbearing note in the light of all the surrounding facts and circumstances among such facts in addition to those we have already mentioned was the fact that although the memorandum of agreement of june   prepared by the appellant referred to borrowing by the sisters and to a temporary loan of  to the general council sisters of the divine savior it said nothing about a loan to the appellant or borrowing by him if the transaction with the sisters was a loan the appellant an experienced lawyer could have made this plain in the written agreement indeed as attorney for the sisters it was his duty to do so his failure to do so coupled with the fact that there was no mention of a loan to him in his discussions with the sisters was evidence that there was no loan the appellant contends that simple reasoning leads to the conclusion that the appellant received a commercial loan from the sisters that there is no other credible explanation for the appellants agreement to pay  interest a year on  and to confer other gratuitous benefits upon the sisters the jury might have believed from the evidence however that the purpose of the appellants munificence his offering of something for nothing was not to make him a borrower but rather to induce the sisters to part readily with funds which he might juggle for his own purposes furthermore the appellants statement to mr darnielle of the maryland national bank in may  before he received the sisters money that he proposed to place  of the money in a certificate of deposit suggested that he intended to pay them interest with their own money again with respect to the motivation of the appellants generosity the jury was entitled to consider the fact that by arranging the public borrowing of  by the sisters which included  for the general council in rome the appellant apparently hoped to relieve the pressure on himself to repay money that he owed to the general council the jury was not bound by the entries in the sisters books referring to the appellants note as an obligation due to the sisters the evidence disclosed that these entries resulted from a question to the appellant by sister fotina treasurer of the order who asked the appellant how the note should be set up on the books in response the appellant gave her a memorandum listing the note as a receivable sister fotina relied upon the appellants advice in recording the transaction in her books and this version of the matter carried over into the sisters claim in the reorganization proceedings in determining the true nature of the transaction between the sisters and the appellant the jury was also entitled to consider the evidence that when he received the sisters money the appellant and his corporations were in straitened if not desperate circumstances the appellant himself characterized his cash position at the end of may  as a distress situation he had attempted without success to obtain financing through commercial loans so that he might make good on defaults and stave off threatened and imminent foreclosures in the circumstances any loan to him would have been risky and virtually unsecured although he was acting as their attorney and financial advisor he made no disclosure of these facts to the sisters if the appellant was to receive the sisters money as a loan then as their lawyer he was bound to make full disclosure to them it is elementary that the relationship between an attorney and his client being one of the highest trust and confidence requires the attorney to act in the utmost good faith and candor to be completely fair and frank with the client and to take no advantage of the confidence reposed in him in the light of this legal and ethical compulsion upon him to reveal all material facts if a loan to him was involved in his discussions with the sisters the appellants silence was doubly significant and was persuasive evidence that no loan was contemplated or made moreover in considering the appellants conduct after he obtained the sisters money the jury might well have believed that his duplicity and falsifications concerning the escrow fund and the mortgages on the marquette block were inconsistent with an honest belief on his part that he was a borrower free to handle the funds as he pleased and not a trustee for a limited purpose in summary we think there was evidence from which the jury could reasonably find that the money received by the appellant was not the proceeds of a loan but was entrusted to him for a specific purpose and that his conversion of the funds was larceny after trust the issue was argued to the jury by able counsel and the appellant finds no fault with the courts instructions we see no reason to disturb the jurys finding iii other arguments advanced by the appellant require only brief discussion first he claims that he secured immunity from prosecution under  usc § vc because he was subpoenaed by the securities and exchange commission to testify and to produce corporate records of parkwood and its affiliated corporations he refused to testify claiming his privilege against selfincrimination but did produce the corporate records since his plea of selfincrimination was honored and he did not give testimony he acquired no immunity he had no right to refuse to produce the books and records of the corporations united states v white  us   s ct   l ed   immunity from prosecution under the provisions of  usc § v c accrues only when a witness invokes his privilege against selfincrimination and is thereafter compelled to testify or to produce his personal records united states v abrams  fd   d cir  cert den  us   s ct   l ed d  cf united states v monia  us   s ct   l ed   the appellant contends also that he was deprived of a fair and speedy trial because a period of some five years elapsed between the dates of the offenses charged against him and the date of the indictment the record shows however that the prosecution of the appellant resulted from an extended investigation into the complicated and tangled affairs of the appellant and his corporations there is no suggestion of any purposeful or otherwise improper delay in the conduct of the investigation nor is there any showing of prejudice to the appellant caused by the delay in these circumstances the appellants argument must be rejected tynan v united states  usappdc   fd  cert den  us   s ct   l ed d   we see no basis for reversal in the fact that the district court gave the standard allen charge fulwood v united states  usappdc   fd   cert den  us   s ct   l ed d   the judgment is affirmed   the full text of the memorandum of agreement was as follows made this th day of june  by and between sisters of the divine savior milwaukee wisconsin hereinafter called sisters and victor j orsinger  connecticut avenue washington  d c hereinafter called orsinger and parkwood incorporated  connecticut avenue washington  d c hereinafter called parkwood witnesseth that whereas the sisters acting through their provincial council have decided to borrow three million dollars  by separate instrument for those general purposes recited herein such borrowing being ecclesiastically approved as an unsecured general credit obligation and whereas orsinger as special legal counsel to the sisters for this purpose has assisted the sisters in arranging this borrowing and whereas parkwood is a real estate corporation all of whose common stock is owned by orsinger and whereas it is intended by this writing to have a convenient memorandum of the purposes and dispositions of the borrowed funds without affecting hereby the unrestricted power of the provincial superior and her council to modify change or abandon at any time the purposes and dispositions recited herein nor does this writing change or affect the sisters legal obligation on the separate loan indenture nor does this writing change or affect any obligations of others including orsinger to the sisters now therefore be it remembered that  the  borrowed by the sisters through keenan and clarey inc minneapolis minn upon a coupon note issue due september   which issue provides inter alia payments of interest only in semiannual installments at the rate of five percent  per annum shall be disbursed as follows a  to victor j orsinger attorney for the purposes described herein b  to the general council sisters of the divine savior rome as a temporary loan to be repaid out of  borrowings of the general council or from other sources c  to the sisters as a reserve fund which may be reinvested by the sisters pending commencement of new building projects in milwaukee wausau and portage  orsinger agrees to exert his best efforts and skills a to purchase in his own name or in corporations owned and controlled by him ground with or without buildings in one of those certain city blocks in milwaukee selected by the sisters for the purpose of assembling a suitable site for a juniorate residence b all such purchases contracts mortgages etc shall be at the complete risk and liability of orsinger or his said corporations and no liability direct or indirect shall attach to the sisters by virtue of this activity and none shall be inferred from the prospective beneficial interest which the sisters may receive as a fruit of this activity c for recordkeeping and taxaccounting purposes the aboverecited  shall be paid to the account of victor j orsinger attorney and he shall then disburse it through parkwood incorporated as required therefore parkwood incorporated shall issue its promissory note for  due within two years as security for the purposes recited here which note shall provide for the prompt payment in semiannual installments of interest at the rate of ten per cent  per annum that is one hundred fifty thousand dollars  each year while the said note is unpaid and outstanding so that the total interest charge on the entire three million dollars  loan shall be paid from the above interest payments made by parkwood and further that parkwood shall reserve such interest in advance by segregating and depositing from its funds the sum of three hundred thousand dollars  in a national bank so that the interest payments will be available when due d on or about july   the sisters and orsinger shall meet to discuss the progress of the purposes herein intended and at that time whether or not such a meeting and discussion are actually held the sisters may confirm alter amend modify or completely abandon all or any
