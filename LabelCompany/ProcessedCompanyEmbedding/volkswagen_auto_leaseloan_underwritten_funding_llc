procedures       both auto loan and auto lease applications are generally subject to the same credit policies and procedures at vw credit contracts that are purchased must comply with vw credits underwriting standards and other requirements as described below under existing agreements between vw credit and dealers vw credits underwriting standards emphasize the prospective lessees ability to pay and creditworthiness as well as the asset value of the motor vehicle to be leased vw credits underwriting servicing and collection activities are conducted principally at processing centers located in libertyville illinois and portland oregon       lease applications submitted to vw credit for a new motor vehicle must list sufficient information to process the application including the applicants     residential information       source and amount of monthly income       monthly mortgage or rent payment  table of contents     social security number and       other personal information       vw credits credit decision is influenced by among other things the applicants custom credit score as obtained from a statistically derived empirical credit scoring process and a credit bureau score vw credit uses a twodimensional credit score matrix based on the custom score and the credit bureau score for loan and lease originations the custom scorecards were developed for vw credit by fair isaac and company inc based on vw credits specific application origination and loan and lease performance information the credit scoring process takes into account information about the applicant including various debt ratios and other personal information vw credit makes its final credit decision based upon the degree of credit risk perceived and the amount of credit requested to improve overall underwriting efficiency a portion of vw credits applications are automatically approved or rejected based on an algorithm which takes into consideration the applicants credit scores time in credit bureau loan to value prior bankruptcies and other related information       vw credits underwriting standards are reviewed by its retail credit committee any change in vw credits underwriting standards requires prior approval from the retail credit committee determination of residual values       the value of the notes being offered under this prospectus is based on the aggregate securitization value of the included units as used in this prospectus securitization value means for each included unit a as of the cutoff date or any date other than the maturity date of the related lease the sum of  the present value discounted at the securitization rate of the aggregate monthly payments remaining on the lease including monthly payments due and not yet paid for which the servicer has never made an advance and  the present value discounted at the securitization rate of the base residual value of the related vehicle and b as of the maturity date of the related lease the base residual value of the related vehicle however the securitization value of a terminated unit as described below under the leases  characteristics of the units  calculation of targeted principal distributable amount is equal to zero base residual value means for each leased vehicle the lowest of i the stated residual value ii the msrp alg residual and iii the maximum residualized msrp alg residual which we also refer to as the mrm alg residual        the msrp alg residual and the mrm alg residual are residual value calculations produced by a thirdparty source automotive lease guide also referred to as alg  an independent publisher of residual value percentages recognized throughout the automotive finance industry for projecting vehicle market values at lease termination the mrm alg residual calculates a residual value estimate that is a percentage of the maximum residualized msrp which consists of the manufacturers suggested retail price commonly referred to as msrp  of the typically equipped vehicle and value adding options giving only partial credit or no credit for those options that add little or no value to the resale price of the vehicle       msrp alg residual means with respect to any lease a residual value estimate produced by alg based on the total msrp of the base vehicle and all vw credit authorized options without making a distinction between the value adding options and nonvalue adding options the calculation of base residual value has the effect of placing a cap on the total capitalized cost of a vehicle for purposes of calculating the residual value of such vehicle       each lease sets forth a residual value which we refer to in this prospectus as the stated residual value established at the time of lease origination as it may be subsequently revised in connection with an extension of a lease in accordance with customary servicing practices the stated residual value as provided in the lease agreement is the value of the vehicle at the end of the lease and is the amount used to calculate the base monthly lease payments under the lease assuming that the lease amortizes like a loan if we assume that the original capitalized cost of the lease is the initial principal amount of the loan that the lease rate is the interest rate that the lease term is the term of the loan and that all monthly payments are timely made the stated residual value is the amount to which the outstanding balance would decline at the scheduled expiration of the  table of contents lease term when a vehicle is sold after being returned by the lessee at the end of the related lease there will be a residual loss if the net sales proceeds of the vehicle are less than the stated residual value       in establishing the stated residual value of volkswagen leased vehicles vw credit uses an internally developed proprietary model the model uses among other things key factors such as msrp wholesale price brand image model image month of lease origination lease term product life cycle and any current or planned sales incentives in its calculation of residual values the model is reviewed regularly by vw credits residual value committee the stated residual values set by the model are compared to vw credits historical offlease vehicle sales performance various independent industry guides such as alg and the national auto research official used car market guide monthly black book  for reasonableness alg and black book are independent publications of residual value percentages which are widely used throughout the automotive finance industry for estimating vehicle market values at lease termination these values serve as a projection of a vehicles future resale value by expressing the future value as a percentage of a vehicles original manufacturers suggested retail price stated residual values for audi vehicles are established to project the value of the vehicle at maturity       the estimated future value of a leased vehicle is a major component of the leasing business specifically any excess of the stated residual value of a vehicle over its actual future market value represents a residual loss at lease termination vw credit believes that the difference between the stated residual values and the actual value at maturity may affect consumer behavior concerning purchasing or returning a vehicle to the lessor at lease termination furthermore vw credit believes that return rates may decline as the difference between stated residual value and actual value declines as it specifically pertains to this transaction the residual loss at lease termination in respect of a leased vehicle will be determined by the excess if any of the base residual value of the leased vehicle which is the lowest of the related stated residual value the msrp alg residual and the mrm alg residual of such vehicle over its actual sales proceeds       all of the leases and leased vehicles that have been allocated to the transaction subi have been originated under the residual value policies described above notwithstanding the foregoing no assurance can be given as to vw credits future experience with respect to the return rates of volkswagen and audi vehicles relating to leases originated under these policies in addition no assurance can be given that vw credits experience with respect to the return of offlease volkswagen and audi vehicles or related residual value losses or the experience of the issuer with respect to the leased vehicles will be similar to that set forth in the residual value loss experience table set forth under vw credit inc  residual value loss experience       vw credit believes that the historical residual value loss experience is partially attributable to new car pricing policies of all manufacturers many manufacturers have recently endeavored to keep new car pricing flat and in some cases less than the prices for models from prior years new car models frequently have more standard equipment that were included as optional equipment in models from prior years additionally vw credit believes that the increased popularity of leasing and increased levels of new car sales over the last five years has resulted in a higher supply of late model used vehicles these factors have exerted additional downward pressure on the value of used vehicles when compared to the price for new vehicles remarketing program       vw credit directs all inbound customer calls to the remarketing department  days prior to lease maturity within  days of maturity the remarketing consultants may proactively call lessees to determine their intent to purchase or return the related leased vehicles at  days and  days prior to maturity vw credit contacts each lease customer through direct mail providing each customer with information regarding the lessees lease obligations including vehicle inspection turnin requirements option to purchase financing availability and the required documentation if the lessee indicates an intention to purchase the leased vehicle the lessee is provided with all necessary documents to complete the purchase lessees that do not respond to any mailings are contacted using phone calls by vw credit to determine their intentions and to apprise them of their lease end obligations       a vehicle inspection including digital pictures of the vehicle normally occurs approximately  days prior to lease maturity and may occur at the lessees residence place of business or a dealership the lessee is  table of contents provided an estimate for excess wear and use and excess mileage charges and is encouraged to file insurance claims and make repairs prior to returning the vehicle inspection reports and digital pictures are processed electronically and transmitted for viewing by dealers online to facilitate vw credits online dealer purchase channel       from time to time vw credit has offered existing lessees special lease programs on selected models to help mitigate residual value losses these programs may offer the lessee waiver of lease payments upon early termination an extended service contract at a reduced cost or reduced annual percentage rate financing there can be no assurance that vw credit will offer any programs in the future lease vehicle maintenance       each vw credit lease contract provides that the lessee is responsible for all maintenance repair service and operating expenses of the leased vehicle in addition the lessee is responsible for all damage to the leased vehicle and for its loss seizure or theft at the scheduled maturity date of a vw credit lease contract if the lessee does not purchase the leased vehicle the vw credit lease contract requires the lessee to pay vw credit the estimated cost to repair any damages to the vehicle resulting from unreasonable or excessive wear and use unreasonable or excess wear and use generally includes but is not limited to the following  inoperative mechanical and electrical parts including power accessories  any and all dents dings scratches chips or rusted areas on any body or trim part  gouges or tears through bumper covers broken or dented grilles  mismatched paint or any mark left by special identification  seats seat belts headlining door panels or carpeting which is torn worn stained burned or damaged  cracks scratches pits or chips to windshields windows head light lenses sealed beams or taillight assemblies  any tire not part of a matching set of five tires of the same brand size and quality or four with an emergency doughnut any tire with less than  inch of tread or any tire with gouged cut torn or plugged sidewalls or  any missing parts accessories and adornments including bumpers ornamentation aerials hubcaps rear view mirrors radio and stereo components or spare tire vw credit may waive all or part of the excessive wear and mileage billed to the lessee methods of vehicle disposal       vw credits vehicle remarketing department handles the disposition of all motor vehicles for vw credit including repossessions early terminations and end of term leases each lease currently provides that upon maturity the lessee has the option to purchase the related motor vehicle for an amount equal to the stated purchase option price if the lessee does not exercise this option the vehicle is returned to a franchised dealer and the vehicle is offered for sale to the returning dealer through two branded internet sites httpwwwaudidirectcom and httpwwwvolkswagendirectcom at a price based on the manheim market report price for audi vehicles and the vw credit wholesale auction results for volkswagen vehicles adjusted for mileage and excessive damage if the dealer to which the vehicle is returned does not exercise its option to purchase the vehicle then the vehicle is offered for sale on the two internet sites in an auction bidding environment the manheim market report price of a vehicle is a price quoted in the manheim market report a publication that monitors and reports the pricing of all cars sold at manheim auctions a large wholesale automobile auction company vehicles that are not purchased by the lessee or a dealer are returned to vw credit for sale through auction vw credit uses a system of auto auctions throughout the united states vw credit has an internal target of  days from the time a vehicle is turned in until it is sold repossessions and early terminations are handled in accordance with various state requirements       remarketing decisions related to auction assignment and logistics are primarily electronic this allows vw credit to control inventory management flow of vehicles to the auction and placement of the vehicles to auction locations that it believes will yield the highest net recovery value       vw credit has regular sales at  major auction locations throughout the united states vw credits highest lease volume is in the northeastern region from time to time auction capacity and demand for preowned vehicles in the northern markets may be insufficient to absorb the volume therefore vw credit may  table of contents transport vehicles to different regions where it perceives a greater demand in order to maximize the vehicles recovery values       the certified preowned vehicle program was established by volkswagen of america to create customer and dealer demand for offlease used volkswagen and audi vehicles and to enhance the value of offlease vehicles to qualify for the certified preowned vehicle program a vehicle must pass an inspection conducted by the related dealer based on standards set by volkswagen of america for certified preowned vehicles volkswagen of america provides a limited warranty which covers the vehicle for a selected period of time and mileage each certified preowned vehicle is covered by a roadside assistance program which is similar to that offered on new vehicles the certified preowned vehicle program is actively marketed by volkswagen of america using from time to time both broadcast and print media       occasionally vw credit offers incentives to lease new vehicles to lessees whose lease contracts are nearing expiration these incentives may include waiver of one or more monthly payments otherwise payable under the related lease for leases allocated to the transaction subi vw credit will pay to the issuer the amount of any monthly payments so waived these incentives may increase the turnin rates for the related vehicles and increase the exposure of noteholders to residual risks insurance       each lease contract requires the lessee to obtain and maintain vehicle liability and physical damage insurance on the leased vehicle vw credits dealer agreements include a requirement that the dealer provide vw credit with written evidence that the lessee has physical damage and liability insurance which meets the requirements of the lease contract at the inception of the lease the amount of insurance required by the lease contracts is at least equal to the amount required by applicable state law subject to customary deductibles vw credit requires the policy to name the origination trust as additional insured with respect to liability and insured and loss payee with respect to physical damage vw credit currently monitors the ongoing status of insurance and attempts to cause the lessee to reinstate insurance in the event the lessee has allowed the policy to lapse nevertheless there can be no assurance that each leased vehicle will continue to be covered by liability and physical damage insurance for the entire term of the lease or that vw credit will continue to monitor insurance while the notes remain outstanding vw credit does not force place insurance       vw credit does not require lessees to carry credit disability credit life credit health or other similar insurance coverage which provides for payments to be made on the leases on behalf of lessees in the event of disability or death to the extent that the lessee obtains any of these insurance coverages payments received on that coverage may if permitted by applicable law be applied to payments on the related lease to the extent that the lessees beneficiary chooses to do so collection and repossession procedures       there are three methods for lessees to make monthly lease payments most lessees mail payments along with a statement to one of three lockboxes a small percentage of lessees use vw credits automated payment option or make payments by telephone       vw credit measures delinquency by the number of days elapsed from the date a payment is due under the lease contract vw credit considers a payment to be past due or delinquent when a lessee fails to make at least  of a scheduled payment by the related due date if a lease is between  and  days delinquent vw credit mails a notice to the lessee and initiates telephone contact requesting payment vw credit gains collection efficiency through the use of technology such as automated dialing predictive dialing and behavioral scoring of all lease accounts if the delinquent lease cannot be brought current or completely collected within  to  days vw credit generally assigns the vehicle to a repossession agent and attempts to repossess the related leased vehicle vw credit holds repossessed vehicles in inventory to comply with any applicable statutory requirements for reinstatement or redemption and then sells or otherwise disposes of the vehicles vw credits current policy is to generally charge off a lease contract on the earlier of  the date on which the proceeds of sale of the leased vehicle are applied to the lease contract and  the month in which the lease contract reaches its th day of delinquency if assigned to a repossession agent for  days any  table of contents deficiencies remaining after repossession and sale of the vehicle or after the full chargeoff of the lease generally are pursued by or on behalf of vw credit to the extent practicable and legally permitted see additional legal aspects of the leases and the leased vehicles  deficiency judgments extensions and pullaheads       on occasion vw credit may extend the term of a lease if  the lessee requests an extension  the lessee is not in default of any of its obligations under the lease and  the lessee agrees to continue to make monthly payments lessees at the end of a lease who intend to lease another volkswagen or audi automobile but cannot do so at lease maturity for reasons such as awaiting delivery of a new vehicle preference for the next model year or other timing circumstances may qualify for a lease term extension of up to a maximum of six months in addition in the future vw credit may adopt incentive programs that encourage term extensions in connection with the lease of another volkswagen or audi automobile if a term extension is granted for any included unit beyond the collection period preceding the final scheduled payment date for the class a notes a postmaturity term extension  vw credit as servicer will be required to deposit into the collection account an amount equal to the securitization value of the included unit at which time that

allow that lessee to enter into a new lease contract for a different volkswagen or audi vehicle as part of a pullahead or other marketing program however an early termination with respect to any lease allocated to the transaction subi will not be permitted unless all pullahead amounts due and payable by the lessee under that lease on or before the date of the lessees election to terminate the lease have been paid by or on behalf of the lessee and are deposited in the collection account within the time period required for the servicer to deposit collections into the collection account following this early termination the servicer will charge the lessee any applicable excess wear and use charges and excess mileage charges in accordance with its customary servicing practices with respect to leases that are terminated early by the related lessee in the absence of a pullahead or other marketing program       as used in this prospectus pullahead amount means with respect to

leases for new volkswagen and audi motor vehicles each of the leases was originated by a dealer in the ordinary course of that dealers business and assigned to the origination trust       each lease in this transaction is a closedend lease over the term of the lease the lessee is required to make substantially equal monthly payments intended to cover the cost of financing the related leased vehicle scheduled depreciation of the leased vehicle and certain sales use or lease taxes from each payment billed with respect to a leased vehicle the monthly payment amount that represents the financing cost and depreciation of the leased vehicle including any capitalized amounts such as service contract premiums will be available to the issuer to make payments in respect of the notes at the scheduled end of the lease term under the lease the lessee has two options          the lessee can purchase the leased vehicle for an amount the maturity date purchase option amount  equal to

each lease provides that the lessee or the lessor may terminate the lease before the scheduled end of the lease term an early termination  in the circumstances discussed below a lessee has the right to request an early termination provided that the lessee is not in default under the lease in addition in the future vw credit may adopt incentive plans that encourage lessees to terminate leases

reasonable manner            within ten days of the early termination by an independent thirdparty appraiser acceptable to the lessee and the lessor and paid for by the lessee of the wholesale value of the leased vehicle that could be received at sale            if the leased vehicle is damaged destroyed stolen abandoned or confiscated by any governmental authority the leased vehicle is declared a total loss by the lessees insurance carriers and the lessee has complied with the insurance requirements set forth in the lease at the time of the loss the amount of the applicable insurance deductible owed by the lessee and the proceeds of the settlement of the insurance claim unless the lessor agrees to a higher amount or            in some states if the lessor elects to retain ownership of the leased vehicle for release or other use the wholesale value of the leased vehicle as specified in the current edition of the nada official used car guide       each lease also allows the lessor to cause an early termination of the lease and repossess the related leased vehicle upon a lessee default events of default under a lease include but are not limited to  the failure by a lessee to make a payment when due  the failure of the lessee to provide truthful information on the credit application  the failure of the lessee to timely or properly perform any obligation under the lease or  the bankruptcy or other insolvency of the lessee       if the lessor terminates a lease early due to a lessee default the lessee will owe the early termination amount including any reasonable attorneys fees and court costs to the extent permitted by law       the lessor may also cause an early termination of a lease if the related leased vehicle is damaged destroyed stolen abandoned or confiscated by any governmental authority if the lessor causes an early termination of the lease and the lessee has complied with the insurance requirements paid the deductible and has satisfied all of the obligations under the lease the lessor will accept the insurance loss proceeds as satisfaction in full of the lessees early termination amount if the lessor causes an early termination and the lessee has not complied with the lease insurance requirements has not paid the deductible or has not satisfied all of its obligations under the lease the lessee will owe the lessor

securitization rate  table of contents representations warranties and covenants       the included units will be identified in a schedule appearing as a schedule to the transaction subi supplement in the subi sale agreement vw credit will make representations and warranties with respect to each lease and related leased vehicle including among other things that each lease met the eligibility criteria described above under  characteristics of the units  eligibility criteria and portfolio characteristics as of the cutoff date on the closing date the transferor will assign all of its rights under the subi sale agreement to the issuer       the subi sale agreement will also provide that if the transaction subi trustee vw credit the issuer the indenture trustee or the transferor discovers a breach of any representation or warranty referred to in the preceding paragraph that materially and adversely affects the issuers interest in the related lease or leased vehicle which breach is not cured in all material respects on or before the payment date related to the collection period in which the servicer discovers such incorrectness either pursuant to notice or otherwise the then applicable unit will be reallocated to the uti on the payment date related to that collection period in connection with this reallocation vw credit will be required to deposit into the collection account a repurchase payment equal to the securitization value of the applicable unit the repurchase payment        the repurchase payment must be made by vw credit as of the payment date immediately following the day on which the related cure period ended upon making that payment the related unit will no longer constitute an included unit maturity prepayment and yield considerations general       the rate of payment of principal of the notes will depend on the rate of payments on the included units including scheduled monthly payments on and prepayments and liquidations of the leases and losses on the included units which cannot be predicted with certainty       a prepayment of a lease in full including payment in respect of the stated residual value of the related leased vehicle may be in the form of     net proceeds resulting from early lease terminations       sales proceeds following a default under the lease or       repurchase payments made by vw credit       the rate of prepayment on the leases may be influenced by a variety of economic social and other factors including the availability of competing lease programs and the conditions in the used motor vehicle market in general prepayments of leases will shorten the weighted average life of the notes which is the average amount of time during which each dollar of the principal amount of a note is outstanding as the rate of payment of principal on the notes will depend primarily on the rate of payment  including prepayments  of the leases the final payment of principal of a class of notes could occur significantly earlier than the applicable final scheduled payment date if lease prepayments cause the principal of a class of notes to be paid earlier than anticipated the related noteholders will bear the risk of being able to reinvest principal payments at interest rates at least equal to the applicable interest rate       historical levels of lease delinquencies and defaults leased vehicle repossessions and losses and residual value losses are discussed under vw credit inc  delinquency repossession and loss data vw credit can give no assurances that the leases will experience the same rate of prepayment or default or any greater or lesser rate than vw credits historical rate or that the residual value experience of leased vehicles related to leases that are scheduled to reach their maturity dates will be the same as vw credits historical residual value loss experience for all of the retail leases in its portfolio including leases that vw credit has sold to third parties but continues to service  table of contents       the effective yield on and average life of the notes will depend upon among other things the amount of scheduled and unscheduled payments on or in respect of the leases and related leased vehicles and the rate at which those payments are paid to the holders of notes in the event of prepayments of the leases noteholders who receive those amounts may be unable to reinvest the related payments received on their notes at yields as high as the related interest rate the timing of changes in the rate of prepayments on the leases and payments in respect of the related leased vehicles may also significantly affect an investors actual yield to maturity and the average life of the notes a substantial increase in the rate of payments on or in respect of the leases and related leased vehicles including prepayments and liquidations of the leases may shorten the final maturity of and may significantly affect the yield on the notes see risk factors  the timing of principal payments is uncertain       the yield to an investor who purchases notes in the secondary market at a price other than par will vary from the anticipated yield if the rate of prepayment on the leases is actually different than the rate the investor anticipates at the time it purchases the notes       in sum the following factors will affect an investors expected yield          the price the investor paid for the related notes            the rate of prepayments including losses in respect of the leases and the related leased vehicles and            the investors assumed reinvestment rate       these factors do not operate independently but are interrelated for example if the rate of prepayments on the leases and the related leased vehicles is slower than anticipated the investors yield will be lower if interest rates exceed the investors expectations and higher if interest rates fall below the investors expectations conversely if the rate of prepayments on or in respect of the leases and the related leased vehicles is faster than anticipated the investors yield will be higher if interest rates surpass the investors expectations and lower if interest rates fall below the investors expectations       in addition any notes outstanding will be paid in full if and when the transferor elects to purchase the transaction subi from the issuer on any payment date when the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the notes is less than or equal to  of the initial principal amount of the notes any notes then outstanding at that time will be prepaid in whole at a redemption price equal to their unpaid principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest weighted average life of the notes       the following information is provided solely to illustrate the effect of prepayments of the leases and the related leased vehicles on the unpaid principal amounts of the notes and the weighted average life of the notes under the assumptions stated below and is not a prediction of the prepayment rates that might actually be experienced with respect to the leases       prepayments on motor vehicle leases may be measured by a prepayment standard or model the prepayment model used in this prospectus is expressed in terms of percentages of abs which means a prepayment model that assumes a constant percentage of the original number of leases in the pool prepay each month the base prepayment assumption which we refer to in this prospectus as the   prepayment assumption assumes that the original principal balance of the leases will prepay as follows          in month one prepayments will occur at  abs and increase by  abs each month until reaching  abs in the rd month of the life of the lease            in month  through  prepayments remain at             in month  prepayments decrease to  abs and remain at that level until the original outstanding principal balance of the contract has been paid in full  table of contents       neither any abs rate nor the  prepayment assumption purports to be a historical description of the prepayment experience or a prediction of the anticipated rate of prepayment of the leases we cannot assure you that the leases will prepay at the levels of the prepayment assumption or at any other rate       the tables below were prepared on the basis of certain assumptions including that     all monthly payments are timely received and no lease is ever delinquent       each fiscal month of vw credit is equivalent to a calendar month       no repurchase payment is required to be made by vw credit in respect of any included unit       there are no losses in respect of the leases       there are no termination payments due to the issuer or to the swap counterparty as a result of the termination of the interest rate swap transaction       payments on the notes are made on the th day of each month whether or not that day is a business day       the servicing fee is  per annum and the administration fee the administration fee  is  per collection period       all prepayments on the leases are prepayments in full and the residual values of the related leased vehicles are paid in full       the reserve account is funded with an amount equal to        the aggregate securitization value of the included units as of the cutoff date is  based on the securitization rate and       the closing date the closing date  is assumed to be september         no representation is made as to what the actual levels of losses and delinquencies on the leases will be because payments on the leases and the leased vehicles will differ from those used in preparing the following tables distributions of principal of the notes may be made earlier or later than as set forth in the tables investors are urged to make their investment decisions on a basis that includes their determination as to anticipated prepayment rates under a variety of the assumptions discussed herein       the following tables set forth the percentages of the unpaid principal amount of each class of the notes that would be outstanding after each of the dates shown based on a rate equal to     and  of the prepayment assumption as used in the table  prepayment assumption assumes no  table of contents prepayments on a lease  prepayment assumption assumes that

new millennium saw volkswagen moving into the luxury segment with the launch of the pricey phaeton sedan and touareg suv though welldesigned and executed the phaeton was a disappointment saleswise perhaps signaling unwillingness on the part of consumers to shell out premium dollars for a brand that lacks the cachet of established upscale names like bmw and mercedesbenz luckily volkswagen has seen success with other vehicles in its lineup which currently includes everything from familyoriented sedans to roomy suvs today the automaker enjoys a reputation for crafting vehicles that offer
