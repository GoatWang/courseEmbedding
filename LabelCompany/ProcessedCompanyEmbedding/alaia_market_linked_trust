management chief counsels office end further info end preamble start supplemental information supplementary information the following is a summary of the application the complete application may be obtained via the commissions web site by searching for the file number or an applicant using the company name box at httpwwwsecgov​search​searchhtm or by calling   applicants representations  alaia market linked trust is a uit that is registered under the act any future trust will be a registered uit bhsi a new york corporation is registered under the securities exchange act of  as a brokerdealer and is the depositor of alaia market linked trust each series will be created by a trust indenture between the depositor and a banking institution or trust company as trustee “trustee”  the depositor acquires a portfolio of securities which it deposits with the trustee in exchange for certificates representing units of fractional undivided interest in the series portfolio “units” the units are offered to the public through the depositor and dealers at a price which during the initial offering period is based upon the aggregate market value of the underlying securities or the aggregate offering side evaluation of the underlying securities if the underlying securities are not listed on a securities exchange plus a frontend sales charge a deferred sales charge or both the maximum sales charge may be reduced in compliance with rule d under the act in certain circumstances which are disclosed in the series prospectus  the depositor may but is not legally obligated to maintain a secondary market for units of an outstanding series other brokerdealers may or may not maintain a secondary market for units of a series if a secondary market is maintained investors will be able to purchase units on the secondary market at the current public offering price plus a frontend sales charge if such a market is not maintained at any time for any series holders of the units “unitholders” of that series may redeem their units through the trustee a deferred sales charge and waiver of deferred sales charge under certain circumstances  applicants request an order to the extent necessary to permit one or more series to impose a sales charge on a deferred basis “dsc” for each series the depositor would set a maximum sales charge per unit a portion of which may be collected “up front” ie at the time an investor purchases the units the dsc would be collected subsequently in installments “installment payments” as described in the application the depositor would not add any amount for interest or any similar or related charge to adjust for such deferral  when a unitholder redeems or sells units the depositor intends to deduct any unpaid dsc from the redemption or sale proceeds when calculating the amount due the depositor will assume that units on which the dsc has been paid in full are redeemed or sold first with respect to units on which the dsc has not been paid in full the depositor will assume that the units held for the longest time are redeemed or sold first applicants represent that the dsc collected at the time of redemption or sale together with the installment payments and any amount collected up front will not exceed the maximum sales charge per unit under certain circumstances the depositor may waive the collection of any unpaid dsc in connection with redemptions or sales of units these circumstances will be disclosed in the prospectus for the relevant series and implemented in accordance with rule d under the act  each series offering units subject to a dsc will state the maximum charge per unit in its prospectus in addition the prospectus for such series will include the table required by form na modified as appropriate to reflect the difference between uits and openend management investment companies and a schedule setting forth the number and date of each installment payment along with the duration of the collection period the prospectus also will disclose that portfolio securities may be sold to pay the dsc if distribution income is insufficient and that securities will be sold pro rata if practicable otherwise a specific security will be designated for sale b exchange option and rollover option  applicants request an order to the extent necessary to permit unitholders of a series to exchange their units for units of another series “exchange option” and unitholders of a series that is terminating to exchange their units for units of a new series of the same type “rollover option” the exchange option and rollover option would apply to all exchanges of units sold with a frontend sales charge a dsc or both  a unitholder who purchases units under the exchange option or rollover option would pay a lower sales charge than that which would be paid for the units by a new investor the reduced sales charge will be reasonably related to the expenses incurred in connection with the administration of the dsc program which may include an amount that will fairly and adequately compensate the depositor and participating underwriters and brokers for their services in providing the dsc program applicants legal analysis a dsc and waiver of dsc  section  of the act defines a “unit investment trust” as an investment company that issues only redeemable securities section a of the act defines a “redeemable security” as a security that upon its presentation to the issuer entitles the holder to receive approximately his or her proportionate share of the issuers current net assets or the cash equivalent of those assets rule c under the act requires that the price of a redeemable security issued by a registered investment company for purposes of sale redemption or repurchase be based on the securitys current net asset value “nav” because the collection of any unpaid dsc may cause a redeeming unitholder to receive an amount less than the nav of the redeemed units applicants request relief from section a and rule c  section d of the act and rule d under the act require a registered investment company and its principal underwriter and dealers to sell securities only at the current public offering price described in the investment companys prospectus with the exception of sales of redeemable securities at prices that reflect scheduled variations in the sales load section a of the act defines the term “sales load” as the difference between the sales price and the portion of the proceeds invested by the start printed page depositor or trustee applicants request relief from section a and section d to permit waivers deferrals or other scheduled variations of the sales load  under section c of the act the commission may exempt classes of transactions if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act applicants state that their proposal meets the standards of section c applicants state that the provisions of section d are intended to prevent a riskless trading in investment company securities due to backward pricing b disruption of orderly distribution by dealers selling shares at a discount and c discrimination among investors resulting from different prices charged to different investors applicants assert that the proposed dsc program will present none of these abuses applicants further state that all scheduled variations in the sales load will be disclosed in the prospectus of each series and applied uniformly to all investors and that applicants will comply with all the conditions set forth in rule d  section ac of the act in relevant part prohibits a trustee or custodian of a uit from collecting from the trust as an expense any payment to the trusts depositor or principal underwriter because the trustees payment of the dsc to the depositor may be deemed to be an expense under section ac applicants request relief under section c from section ac to the extent necessary to permit the trustee to collect installment payments and disburse them to the depositor applicants submit that the relief is appropriate because the dsc is more properly characterized as a sales load b exchange option and rollover option  sections a and c of the act prohibit any offer of exchange by a uit for the securities of another investment company unless the terms of the offer have been approved in advance by the commission applicants request an order under sections a and c for commission approval of the exchange option and the rollover option c net worth requirement  section a of the act requires that a registered investment company have  of net worth prior to making a public offering applicants state that each series will comply with this requirement because the depositor will deposit more than  of securities applicants assert however that the commission has interpreted section a as requiring that the initial capital investment in an investment company be made without any intention to dispose of the investment applicants state that under this interpretation a series would not satisfy section a because of the depositors intention to sell all the units of the series  rule a under the act exempts uits from section a if certain conditions are met one of which is that the uit invest only in “eligible trust securities” as defined in the rule applicants state that they may not rely on rule a because certain series collectively “structured series” will invest all or a portion of their assets in equity securities shares of registered investment companies or flexible exchange® options “flex options”  which do not satisfy the definition of eligible trust securities  applicants request an exemption under section c of the act to the extent necessary to exempt the structured series from the net worth requirement in section a applicants state that the series and the depositor will comply in all respects with the requirements of rule a except that the structured series will not restrict their portfolio investments to “eligible trust securities” d capital gains distribution  section b of the act and rule b under the act provide that except under limited circumstances no registered investment company may distribute longterm gains more than once every twelve months rule bc under certain circumstances exempts a uit investing in eligible trust securities as defined in rule a from the requirements of rule b because the structured series do not limit their investments to eligible trust securities however the structured series will not qualify for the exemption in paragraph c of rule b applicants therefore request an exemption under section c from section b and rule b to the extent necessary to permit capital gains earned in connection with the sale of portfolio securities to be distributed to unitholders along with the structured series regular distributions in all other respects applicants will comply with section b and rule b  applicants state that their proposal meets the standards of section c applicants assert that any sale of portfolio securities would be triggered by the need to meet trust expenses installment payments or by redemption requests events over which the depositor and the structured series do not have control applicants further state that because principal distributions must be clearly indicated in accompanying reports to unitholders as a return of principal and will be relatively small in comparison to normal dividend distributions there is little danger of confusion from failure to differentiate among distributions applicants conditions applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions a dsc relief and exchange and rollover options  whenever the exchange option or rollover option is to be terminated or its terms are to be amended materially any holder of a security subject to that privilege will be given prominent notice of the impending termination or amendment at least  days prior to the date of termination or the effective date of the amendment provided that a no such notice need be given if the only material effect of an amendment is to reduce or eliminate the sales charge payable at the time of an exchange to add one or more new series eligible for the exchange option or the rollover option or to delete a series which has terminated and b no notice need be given if under extraordinary circumstances either i there is a suspension of the redemption of units of the series under section e of the act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or ii a series temporarily delays or ceases the sale of its units because it is unable to invest amounts effectively in accordance with applicable investment objectives policies and restrictions  an investor who purchases units under the exchange option or rollover option will pay a lower sales charge than that which would be paid for the units by a new investor  the prospectus of each series offering exchanges or rollovers and any sales literature or advertising that mentions the existence of the exchange option or rollover option will disclose that the exchange option and the rollover option are subject to modification termination or suspension start printed page without notice except in certain limited cases  any dsc imposed on a series units will comply with the requirements of subparagraphs   and  of rule ca under the act  each series offering units subject to a dsc will include in its prospectus the disclosure required by form na relating to deferred sales charges modified as appropriate to reflect the differences between uits and openend management investment companies and a schedule setting forth the number and date of each installment payment b net worth requirement applicants will comply in all respects

the act defines a unit investment trust as an investment company that issues only redeemable securities section a of the act defines a redeemable security as a security that upon its presentation to the issuer entitles the holder to receive approximately his or her proportionate share of the issuers current net assets or the cash equivalent of those assets rule c under the act requires that the price of a redeemable security issued by a registered investment company for purposes of sale redemption or repurchase be based on the securitys current net asset value nav because the collection of any unpaid dsc may cause a redeeming unitholder to receive an amount less than the nav of the redeemed units applicants request relief from section a and rule c section d of the act and rule d under the act require a registered investment company and its principal underwriter and dealers to sell securities only at the current public offering price described in the investment companys prospectus with the exception of sales of redeemable securities at prices that reflect scheduled variations in the sales load section a of the act defines the term sales load as the difference between the sales price and the portion of the proceeds invested by the page  depositor or trustee applicants request relief from section a and section d to permit waivers deferrals or other scheduled variations of the sales load under section c of the act the commission may exempt classes of transactions if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act applicants state that their proposal meets the standards of section c applicants state that the provisions of section d are intended to prevent a riskless trading in investment company securities due to backward pricing b disruption of orderly distribution by dealers selling shares at a discount and c discrimination among investors resulting from different prices charged to different investors applicants assert that the proposed dsc program will present none of these abuses applicants further state that all scheduled variations in the sales load will be disclosed in the prospectus of each series and applied uniformly to all investors and that applicants will comply with all the conditions set forth in rule d section ac of the act in relevant part prohibits a trustee or custodian of a uit from collecting from the trust as an expense any payment to the trusts depositor or principal underwriter because the trustees payment of the dsc to the depositor may be deemed to be an expense under section ac applicants request relief under section c from section ac to the extent necessary to permit the trustee to collect installment payments and disburse them to the depositor applicants submit that the relief is appropriate because the dsc is more properly characterized as a sales load exchange option and rollover option sections a and c of the act prohibit any offer of exchange by a uit for the securities of another investment company unless the terms of the offer have been approved in advance by the commission applicants request an order under sections a and c for commission approval of the exchange option and the rollover option net worth requirement section a of the act requires that a registered investment company have  of net worth prior to making a public offering applicants state that each series will comply with this requirement because the depositor will deposit more than  of securities applicants assert however that the commission has interpreted section a as requiring that the initial capital investment in an investment company be made without any intention to dispose of the investment applicants state that under this interpretation a series would not satisfy section a because of the depositors intention to sell all the units of the series rule a under the act exempts uits from section a if certain conditions are met one of which is that the uit invest only in eligible trust securities as defined in the rule applicants state that they may not rely on rule a because certain series collectively structured series will invest all or a portion of their assets in equity securities shares of registered investment companies or flexible exchangesupreg options flex options  which do not satisfy the definition of eligible trust securities   applicants state that a structured series will invest in flex options with expiration dates that coincide with the structured series maturity date and any relief granted from the provisions of sections a and b of the act and rule b under the act included in the order will not extend to any series that intends to hold a derivative security other than flex options  applicants request an exemption under section c of the act to the extent necessary to exempt the structured series from the net worth requirement in section a applicants state that the series and the depositor will comply in all respects with the requirements of rule a except that the structured series will not restrict their portfolio investments to eligible trust securities capital gains distribution section b of the act and rule b under the act provide that except under limited circumstances no registered investment company may distribute longterm gains more than once every twelve months rule bc under certain circumstances exempts a uit investing in eligible trust securities as defined in rule a from the requirements of rule b because the structured series do not limit their investments to eligible trust securities however the structured series will not qualify for the exemption in paragraph c of rule b applicants therefore request an exemption under section c from section b and rule b to the extent necessary to permit capital gains earned in connection with the sale of portfolio securities to be distributed to unitholders along with the structured series regular distributions in all other respects applicants will comply with section b and rule b applicants state that their proposal meets the standards of section c applicants assert that any sale of portfolio securities would be triggered by the need to meet trust expenses installment payments or by redemption requests events over which the depositor and the structured series do not have control applicants further state that because principal distributions must be clearly indicated in accompanying reports to unitholders as a return of principal and will be relatively small in comparison to normal dividend distributions there is little danger of confusion from failure to differentiate among distributions applicants conditions applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions dsc relief and exchange and rollover options whenever the exchange option or rollover option is to be terminated or its terms are to be amended materially any holder of a security subject to that privilege will be given prominent notice of the impending termination or amendment at least  days prior to the date of termination or the effective date of the amendment provided that a no such notice need be given if the only material effect of an amendment is to reduce or eliminate the sales charge payable at the time of an exchange to add one or more new series eligible for the exchange option or the rollover option or to delete a series which has terminated and b no notice need be given if under extraordinary circumstances either i there is a suspension of the redemption of units of the series under section e of the act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or ii a series temporarily delays or ceases the sale of its units because it is unable to invest amounts effectively in accordance with applicable investment objectives policies and restrictions an investor who purchases units under the exchange option or rollover option will pay a lower sales charge than that which would be paid for the units by a new investor the prospectus of each series offering exchanges or rollovers and any sales literature or advertising that mentions the existence of the exchange option or rollover option will disclose that the exchange option and the rollover option are subject to modification termination or suspension page  without notice except in certain limited cases any dsc imposed on a series units will comply with the requirements of subparagraphs   and  of rule ca under the act each series offering units subject to a dsc will include in its prospectus the disclosure required by form na relating to deferred sales charges modified as appropriate to reflect the differences between uits and openend management investment companies and a schedule setting forth the number and date of each installment payment net worth requirement applicants will comply in all respects with the requirements of rule a under the act except that the structured series will not restrict their portfolio investments to eligible trust securities for the commission by

issue such as creating highlights in your hair or covering up some gray hair although hair coloring can be gender and agespecific most people can use any type of hair coloring some hair coloring products are extremely simple to use and just require you to brush the color in or even lather the color much like youd with shampoo when coloring your hair the time involved is directly related to how much youre changing the color if youre just changing your shade slightly the time involved is minimal however if youre going dark brown to light blonde for example there are several steps involved
