view monthly performance report view client flyer view client quarterly fund snapshot all investments carry risk different investments carry different levels of risk depending on the investment strategy and the underlying assets generally the higher the potential return of an investment the greater the risk the risks of investing in this fund include market risk changes in the prices of futures positions held by the fund may result in loss of principal or large movements in the unit price of the fund within short or long periods of time global and local economic financial political technological and environmental factors can drive changes in the prices of futures positions it is not possible to predict the occurrence or magnitude of these and other potentially relevant factors different factors may affect the price of individual futures positions particular asset classes such as shares bonds interest rates currencies and commodities or futures positions generally at different times leverage risk arises when the fund takes on positions that are greater in size than its assets the fund will take leveraged positions with the aim of increasing returns which can also lead to increased losses leverage arises in the fund through taking both long and short futures positions which are larger in size than the net asset value of the fund while this process forms a key part of the investment strategy it may mean that gains and losses may be significantly greater than those in a fund that is not leveraged the fund employs significant leverage and this may result in a loss of some or all of the funds capital strategy model and research risk wintons investment approach is based on research into past data and the application of that research to the development of mathematical models that attempt to forecast returns risk correlation and transaction costs many of these models are trend following models that attempt to identify and exploit market trends mathematical models are representations of reality but they may be incomplete andor flawed and there is an inherent risk that any forecasts derived from them may be inaccurate particularly if the research or models are based on or incorporate inaccurate assumptions or data assumptions or data may be inaccurate from the outset or may become inaccurate as a result of many factors such as changes in market structure increased government intervention in markets or growth in assets managed in accordance with similar investment strategies in particular such factors may make winton’s trend following models less effective because they may lessen the prospect of identified trends occurring or continuing in the future as a result of the foregoing the investment system may not generate profitable trading signals and the fund may suffer a loss for a full description of the risks of investing in the fund you should read the product disclosure statement before deciding to invest

opportunities fund systematic investing research center about winton   invest with us literature  applications   systematic investing   investment approach winton’s approach to investment management consists of treating the investment universe as a large body of data within which winton can search for patterns and structures that give rise to a small degree of predictability such small informational “edges” can be exploited by composing fairly complex portfolios of strategies that are applied through time in a consistent and sufficiently disciplined fashion to allow for a profitable outcome to ensue   systematic process finding such patterns involves organizing and analyzing data using mathematical and statistical methods similar to those employed by astrophysicists when researching cosmic phenomena or particle physicists in their quest for the higgs boson this explains why many of winton’s scientists have been trained in these fields the core of winton’s research effort is directed at identifying explanatory variables which could form the basis of profitable investment strategies wintons investment systems operate a diverse range of systemic approaches making use of different types of market relevant data   dedicated research team over one quarter of our employees are in research and technology roles focused on statistical and computational modelling of data winton recruits highly qualified scientists and engineers that are organized into an efficient and multidisciplinary research team   consistent riskadjusted returns our aim is to generate consistent riskadjusted returns for our clients over the long term to this end our sophisticated models capture a wide range of risk factors seeking to provide insulation from market shocks and

systematic investment process that is based on statistical research winton futures program follows a disciplined investment process that is based on statistical analysis of historical data the initial stage of the process involves collecting cleaning and organizing large amounts of data  the winton futures program uses a wide variety of data inputs including factors that are intrinsic to markets

research into the data in an attempt to quantify the probability of particular markets rising or falling conditional on a variety of quantifiable factors winton’s research is used to develop mathematical models that attempt to forecast market returns the variability or volatility associated with such returns often described as “risk” the correlation between different markets and transaction costs these forecasts are used in investment strategies that determine what positions should be held to maximize profit within a certain range of risk as a result of winton’s research it expects that investments made in accordance with this process will have an improved chance of being successful which is expected to lead to profits over the longterm key personnel david harding chief
