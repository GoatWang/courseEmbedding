the real ecommerce giantjoseph hargettinvestorplacejune  reblogsharetweetshareinvestorplace  stock market news stock advice  trading tipsalibaba group holding ltd nysebaba is rocketing higher thursday on an eyepopping announcement from an investor event this morning alibaba is forecasting its largest quarterly increase in revenues since its  ipo —  to  up to  billion for this year fiscal  — and that has baba stock up by double digits in premarket tradeview photossource shutterstockalibaba has been called the chinese amazoncom inc nasdaqamzn but especially in light of this morning’s news i think that sentiment is selling the potential of baba short — and i have a couple of ways to trade bullishly if you agreeyes amazon is currently much bigger than its chinese counterpart with a market valuation just shy of  billion compared to roughly  billion for baba stock what’s more amazon has been on a tear lately dominating the us ecommerce market and drawing in technical traders by the droves after topping the  markbut alibaba has something that amazon doesn’t have — access to chinese consumersstateside we’re often lulled into complacency that the us economy is the best and for now that belief is holding true but china’s economy has seen average  gross domestic product gdp growth of  for the past several years compared to us gdp growth that has barely topped  growth at the best of times since   best cheap stocks to buy now under  what’s more alibaba has a considerable edge when it comes to china’s ecommerce market  in the states ecommerce is forecast to grow between  to  in  based on census bureau data putting the us market at about  billion on the high side meanwhile china’s ecommerce market hit  trillion last year and is expected to top  trillion in you can see why amazon really wants into china but try as it might the company has made little to no headway baba meanwhile is not only smack in the middle of the chinese ecommerce revolution but it already has its hooks in the us market — those expanding there could take a bit more time given the current political climategiven the rate of growth in the chinese ecommerce market alibaba can afford to proceed at its leisure with analysts forecasting average revenue growth of  over the next three quarters for alibaba and amazon anticipated to average  sales growth for the same period it’s not a matter of if alibaba will be bigger than amazon but whenbaba stock chartmore click to enlarge so the question becomes “do i buy baba stock now”if you’ve got the right appetite for risk the answer is a resounding yes the problem however is that alibaba stock is trading near alltime highs and is just shy of overbought levels that said baba stock has been in this exact position since the beginning of april and yet the stock continues to defy selling pressure and trek higherluckily you can use alibaba options as insurance to mitigate the risks of a retreat while adding this redhot chinese ecommerce titan to your portfolio  trades for baba stockput sell selling put options can be used for more than just collecting premium on a sidling stock you can also use these options as a way to essentially name the price you want to pay to add the underlying stock to your portfolio with the risk of a correction in baba stock rising alongside the stock’s continued advance you can sell alibaba puts to acquire the shares if they hit your desired price target — and get paid to do soright now a pullback to or below  would represent a buying opportunity setting  as your target buy price you could sell a jul  put for  or  per contract and wait for the shares to pull backread moreif baba stock doesn’t trade below  by the time july options expire you keep the premium and roll your target out to the next contract month and try again the downside is that it’s possible that alibaba will never trade below  leaving you sans the shares but still banking the premium for selling the options should you buy tesla inc tsla stock  pros  cons call spread if you’d rather just bet on a continuation of the current baba stock rally the july  bull call spread has potentialat last check this spread was offered at  cents or  per pair of contracts breakeven lies at  while a maximum profit of  or  per pair of contracts is possible if baba stock closes at or above  when july options expireas a note these options prices

alltime highs today is this hypergrowth stock still a good deal anders bylund tmfzahrim jul   at am shares of alibaba group nysebaba are trading near alltime highs right now setting new records on nearly a daily basis the stock has gained a total of  so far in  or  over the last year is alibabas stock getting overheated at these levels or would it still make sense to buy the stock right now lets find out image source alibaba how does alibaba work the chinabased ecommerce giant has been in business since  but joined the american stock markets as recently as  its the amazoncom nasdaqamzn of china the ebay nasdaqebay of china and whole lot more measured by roughly  billion in gross merchandise volume this is already the largest retail business in the world bigger than amazon bigger than ebay bigger even than walmart nysewmt that being said alibabas business model is a closer match to ebay than to amazon or walmart the company doesnt directly make or sell products but acts as a middleman between buyers and sellers across china that model is expanding beyond the borders of the middle kingdom too the next time youre buying a fidget spinner or an offbrand usb charger chances are very good that alibaba had a hand in that transaction yes even if you bought it from amazon or ebay  those are our american gateways to the alibaba universe via independent sellers in china and america is the business still growing you bet it is in the recently reported fourth quarter of fiscal year  alibaba delivered  yearoveryear revenue growth an  increase in adjusted earnings per share and  higher free cash flows that sales growth is holding steady quarter by quarter but the profitability trends are accelerating in other words this gigantic business is still growing like a hungry startup alibaba is leaving american growth phenom amazon in the dust yes alibaba is still growing and dont forget that the vast majority of this companys sales are generated right at home in the chinese market the revenue contribution from international commerce stopped at just  in  up from  in  expect the international business to pick up steam over the next few years  alibabas management is currently laying the foundation for longterm growth in the international segment according to the fourthquarter report theres a whole lot of untapped growth outside of china and alibaba is only getting started image source getty images whats next this is not a cheap stock today alibaba shares are trading at  times adjusted earnings and  times free cash flows and these valuation ratios have been rising relentlessly in  if youre looking for a deepdiscount value stock alibaba isnt your bag furthermore the company doesnt pay a dividend so this is where we say goodbye to singleminded income investors for pretty much anybody else this is an exciting growth stock with acres of greenfield opportunity ahead of it both in china and around the world it might make sense to wait for a big shareprice drop before building an alibaba position in your portfolio but you just cant say for sure that the stock price will be this low again i mean if you gave up on amazon when it traded at record prices seven years ago waiting on the sidelines for a plunge that never came would have lost you an  return as an alibaba investor myself im betting that the stock is a good deal even at todays skyhigh prices sometimes you get what you pay for and it looks like alibaba will continue to crush the market for years to come anders bylund owns shares of alibaba and amazon the motley fool owns

object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
