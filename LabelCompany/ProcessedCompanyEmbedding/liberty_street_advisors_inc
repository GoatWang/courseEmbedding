fluctuations and operating expenses increasing vacancies rising construction costs and potential modifications to government regulations reits are subject to declines in the value of real estate as it relates to general and local economic conditions and decreases in property revenues continued disruptions in the financial markets and deteriorating economic conditions could adversely affect the value of the fund’s investments as a nondiversified fund the fund may focus its assets in the securities of fewer issuers which exposes the fund to greater market risk than if its assets were diversified among a greater number of issuers the fund’s investments will be concentrated in the real estate sector the focus of the fund’s portfolio on a specific sector may present more risks than if the portfolio were broadly diversified over numerous sectors foreign investment risk these risks include currency fluctuations economic or financial instability lack of timely or reliable financial information or unfavorable political or legal developments foreign companies are generally subject to different legal and accounting standards than us companies the fund invests in small and midcap real estate companies which may involve less trading and therefore a larger impact on a stock’s price than customarily associated with larger more established company stocks in order to qualify for the favorable tax treatment generally available to regulated investment companies the fund must satisfy certain diversification requirements the fund’s strategy of investing in a relatively small number of securities may cause it inadvertently to fail to satisfy the diversification requirements if the fund were to fail to qualify as a regulated investment company it would be taxed in the same manner as an ordinary corporation and distributions to its shareholders would not be deductible by the fund in computing its taxable income the fund may not be suitable for all investors we encourage

of the funds shares generally fixed income securities decrease in value if interest rates rise and increase in value if interest rates fall with longerterm securities being more sensitive than shorterterm securities these risks are greater during periods of rising inflation it is expected that the cefs in which the fund will invest will be leveraged as a result of borrowing or other investment techniques as a result the fund will be exposed indirectly to leverage and may expose the fund to higher volatility in the market value of such cef and the possibility that the funds longterm returns will be diminished in addition regulations implemented pursuant to the doddfrank act particularly the volcker rule may in the future hinder or restrict a cefs ability to maintain leverage which in turn may reduce the total return and tax exempt income generated by the underlying cefs in which the fund will invest and may cause a reduction in the value of the funds shares there is no guarantee that the funds income will be exempt from regular federal income taxes events occurring after the date of issuance of a municipal bond or after a cefs acquisition of a municipal bond may result in a determination that interest is subject to federal income tax federal or state changes in the tax treatment of municipal bonds may make municipal bonds less attractive as investments and cause them to decline in value the fund and the cefs held by the fund may use derivative instruments futures contracts options swap agreements andor sell securities short each of these instruments and strategies involve risks different from direct investments in the underlying assets risks include futures contracts may cause the value of the funds shares to be more volatile and expose the fund to leverage and tracking risks the fund may not fully benefit from or may lose money on option or shorting strategies swaps may be leveraged are subject to counterparty risk and may be difficult to value or liquidate the funds turnover rate may be high a high turnover rate may lead to higher transaction costs a greater number of taxable transactions and negatively affect the funds performance as a nondiversified fund the fund may focus its assets in the securities of fewer issuers which exposes the fund to greater market risk than if its assets were diversified among a greater number of issuers the fund is newly organized and has no operating history as a result prospective investors have no track record or history on which to base their investment decisions diversification does not assure a profit or protect against a loss the fund may not be suitable for all investors we encourage you to consult with appropriate tax and financial professionals before considering an investment
