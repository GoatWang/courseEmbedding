new highs across the board lead by the nasdaq technology sector and then followed closely by the dow jones industrial average our domestic markets have done very very well driving the market in part was consumer confidence consumer spending exceeded  for the first half of  the largest rise in eleven years the markets rise seems to have buoyed consumer confidence which rose for the seventh consecutive month in may the resilience of the economy has bolstered more optimistic expectations for the remainder of the year also inspiring consumer confidence was one of the lowest levels of inflation in a generation as measured by the consumer price index cpi inflation has been between   and  compared to approximately  in the beginning of the s and  to  in the beginning of the s still inflation worries have been seeping into the market the growing conviction that asian and latin american economies are recovering is raising commodity prices particularly oil the price of west texas intermediate oil surged from less than  in february to almost  in early may that alone almost guarantees a rise in the headline inflation rate this year which is the rate of inflation as measured by the entire cpi but its important to note that the federal reserve board looks primarily at the core inflation rate which is the cpi minus food and energy and the core inflation rate looks as if it will remain low at about  this year fiscal year  results for treasuries trust fixed income commentary for fiscal year ended may   the treasuries trust had a total return of  and its average annualized

economy have been stretched to the upper limits unemployment stands at a twenty nine year low of  and eleven states currently have jobless rates of under  while different surveys show vary  ing rates of wage increases they all indicate compensation rising significantly faster than prices the conference boards latest surveys of companies suggest that pay raises will average about  both for this

returned  the capital income fund returned  the multiple index trust returned  and the yorktown classic value trust returned  as always past performance is no guarantee of future results the us market rally started in the fall of  and was fueled by investor appetite for growth stocks particularly technology communications and internetrelated stocks on march  the dow jones industrial average closed above  for the first time and the broader averages also flirted with their alltime highs however market activity was narrow roughly onethird of the performance of the standard  poors  index came from just two stocks microsoft corp and america online inc the divergence between large and small cap stocks widened dramatically  as indicated by the russell  indexs decline of more than  for the twelve month period only value stocks broke free and reversed their trend to finally outperform the overheated technology sector by the end of may despite our concerns about the technology sectors lofty valuations the broad markets both domestic and overseas are supporting good economic news that is getting better the us economy is growing at a healthy  to   annual rate and unemployment remains at near historical lows with only a trace of inflation consumer spending which accounts for twothirds of gross domestic product growth is high and so far in  corporate profits have been much stronger than had been expected however we do see some vulnerability trade is a weak spot in the economy right now exports of us goods and services dropped in the first quarter while imports soared this reflects the fact that the us is one of the few countries financially fit enough to buy goods produced elsewhere in the world but for as long as less vibrant international economies are unable to buy us goods the profitability of us companies trying to export will be challenged  when you think about it vulnerability in regard to the international economy is nothing new globally the outlook is slightly more positive than it was a few months ago for example the european markets are slowing down which will most likely lead to the central bank lowering interest rates in order to boost domestic spending in many countries in europe there are no fixedrate mortgages only adjustablerate mortgages when interest rates go down mortgages are reduced and homeowners spend money elsewhere this has a huge impact on consumer spending and will help european equities in the long term additionally the situation in japan remains unchanged and problems in the emerging markets havent had the negative impact many people expected both the mexican and brazilian stock markets have actually risen in the past three months going forward in summary there are concerns that the current economy is unsustainable and we soon could see an abrupt end in many cases however people are looking for a slowdown because they are fearful growth will drive up inflation  these are particularly older investors who are accustomed to inflation accompanying growth but we currently just dont see the pressure toward inflation at all so theres no reason to want a slowdown the best approach now as in any market is to diversify and invest for the long term pricewaterhousecoopers llp the trusts independent auditors have completed their annual examination and audited financial statements accompany this

funds investment objective background and discussion  the funds current investment objective is to seek maximum total return from capital growth and income the trust is asking the funds shareholders to approve changing the funds investment objective to state the funds investment objective is to seek income consistent with the preservation of capital the most significant aspect of the change in investment objective is the elimination capital growth as an objective of the fund if the funds shareholders approve the change the funds objective will be to produce income and preserve capital capital growth will no longer be a part of the funds investment strategy the advisers management of the fund will not change in terms of its overall philosophy of seeking maximum diversification what will change will be the focus of the advisers investments the adviser will now focus on fixed income securities if the funds investment objective is changed the investment strategies and risks of the fund will change as well in the table below the funds investment strategies and risks are set forth as currently stated and as would become effective if the funds investment objective is changed investment objective     current   proposed maximum total return from capital growth and income   the funds investment objective is to seek income consistent with the preservation of capital   investment strategies current   proposed the short term bond fund invests in securities that in the advisers opinion offer the opportunity for maximum total return from capital growth and income   the adviser exercises a flexible strategy in the selection of investments and is not limited by investment style or asset class the fund normally invests in the common stock of us and foreign issuers and in other us and foreign securities including       securities convertible into common stock and securities issued through private placements       underlying funds       etfs that represent interests in a portfolio of common stocks or fixed income securities seeking to track the performance of a securities index or similar benchmark such as the sp  index the nyse composite index the nasdaq composite index or the russell  index but that also have a component of active management such that the investment manager of the security attempts to outperform the applicable index       real estate investment trusts and other issuers that invest deal or otherwise engage in transactions in real estate   under normal circumstances the short term bond fund invests at least  of its assets in fixed income securities that in the advisers opinion offer the opportunity for income consistent with preservation of capital the funds portfolio will have an average aggregate maturity of not more than three years   the adviser exercises a flexible strategy in the selection of various types of debt or fixed income investments and is not limited by investment style sector or asset class the fund seeks to provide diversification by allocating the funds investments among various areas of the fixed income markets   the fund primarily invests in the investment grade debt securities of various types such investments primarily include but not limited to       corporate debt of us and foreign issuers including emerging market that are denominated in us dollars       mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities including privately issued mortgagerelated securities and commercial mortgagebacked securities privately issued mortgagerelated securities are limited to not more than  of the funds total assets        debt securities domestic and foreign corporate notes and bonds and structured notes   the adviser invests directly in equity or debt securities when it believes attractive investment opportunities exist attractive investments are securities that have been identified by the adviser as trading below their current intrinsic value and that possess fundamental attributes that in the advisers opinion indicate significant long term growth and income potential although the adviser considers ratings in determining whether securities convertible into common stock or debt securities are appropriate investments for the fund such securities may include investments rated below investment grade commonly known as junk bonds   when investing in underlying funds the adviser considers among other things the underlying funds past performance and their investment objectives and policies the investment style reputation and quality of their investment advisers and the underlying funds size and cost structure the adviser selects etfs in which to invest based on a number of factors including an analysis of their past performance market sector and liquidity   through direct investments and indirect investments in underlying funds and etfs the short term bond fund may have significant exposure to foreign securities including emerging market securities smallcap securities and specific sectors of the market the adviser may sell a security or redeem shares of an underlying fund given a variety of circumstances such as when an investment no longer appears to the adviser to offer the potential to achieve the short term bond funds investment objective when an investments performance does not meet the advisers expectations when an investment opportunity arises that the adviser believes is more compelling to realize gains or limit losses or to raise cash to meet shareholder redemptions or to pay expenses   the fund may from time to time take temporary defensive positions that are inconsistent with the funds principal investment strategies in attempting to respond to adverse market economic political or other conditions when the fund takes a defensive position the funds assets may be held in cash andor invested in money market mutual funds money market instruments including repurchase agreements or other short term securities considered by the adviser to be of       securities issued or guaranteed by the us government its agencies or governmentsponsored enterprises       bonds of foreign government issuers including its agencies payable in us dollars       inflation linked investments       exchange traded funds with similar investment strategies and objectives       taxable municipal bonds andor taxexempt municipal bonds although the short term bond fund invests primarily in investmentgrade debt securities as designated by sp moodys or fitch it may invest a portion of its net assets in securities rated below investment grade normally we would expect the majority of these investments to be rated in the top tier of below investment grade ie bb designations by sp additionally the fund may invest a portion of its net assets in any one or a combination of the following types of fixed income securities but not limited to       preferred stock baby bonds       highyield debt securities commonly referred to as lowerrated or junk bonds       senior loans including bridge loans assignments and participations       nonrated securities for sp moodys or fitch       convertible securities including convertible bonds and preferred stocks the fund attempts to manage interest rate risk through its management of dollarweighted average modified duration of the securities it holds in its portfolio under normal conditions the funds portfolio will have an average aggregate maturity of not more than three years the fund also attempts to manage risk through credit analysis with a focus on company assets free cash flow capital stack earnings economic prospects and debt structure while not limited by these factors the goal of all investments is to provide a reasonable amount of income with the barbell of capital preservation and how they interact within the portfolio to this end the fund does not attempt to purchase securities with an attempt to quickly turnover those assets    a defensive nature when the fund is invested in this manner it may not achieve its investment objective   the adviser may sell a security or redeem shares of an underlying fund given a variety of circumstances such as when an investment no longer appears to the adviser to offer the potential to achieve the short term bond funds investment objective when an investments performance does not meet the advisers expectations when an investment opportunity arises that the adviser believes is more compelling to realize gains or limit losses or to raise cash to meet shareholder redemptions or to pay expenses   the fund may from time to time take temporary defensive positions that are inconsistent with the funds principal investment strategies in attempting to respond to adverse market economic political or other conditions when the fund takes a defensive position the funds assets may be held in up to  cash andor invested in money market mutual funds money market instruments including repurchase agreements or other short term securities considered by the adviser to be of a defensive nature when the fund is invested in this manner it may not achieve its investment objective   investment risks current   proposed general risks  there is a risk that you could lose all or

equity securities generally fluctuate more than those of other securities such as debt securities market risk the risk that prices of securities will decrease because of the interplay of market forces may affect a single issuer industry or sector of the economy or may affect the market as a whole   company risk  the fund may invest in securities that involve certain special circumstances that the adviser believes offer the opportunity for longterm capital appreciation these investments may involve greater risks of loss than investments in securities of wellestablished companies with a history of consistent operating patterns   investment company risk any investment in an openend or closedend investment company involves risk and although the fund invests in a number of underlying funds this

the investment advisers of the underlying funds are made independently of the fund and the funds adviser the investment adviser of one underlying fund may be purchasing securities of the same issuer whose securities are being sold by the investment adviser of another underlying fund the result of this would be an indirect expense to the fund without accomplishing any investment purpose   closedend fund risk shares of closedend funds frequently trade at a price per share that is less than the net asset value per share there can be no assurance that the market discount on shares of any closedend fund purchased by the fund will ever decrease or that when the fund seeks to sell shares of a closed end fund it can receive the net asset value of those shares   business development companies risk business development companies bdcs are a specialized form of closedend fund that invest generally in small developing companies and financially troubled businesses bdcs invest in private companies and thinly traded securities of public companies including debt instruments generally little public information exists for private and thinly traded companies and there is a risk

declining interest rates in general debt securities with longer term maturities tend to fall more in value when interest rates rise than debt securities with shorter terms a debt security is also subject to credit risk which is the possibility that the credit strength of an issuer will weaken andor an issuer of a debt security will fail to make timely payments of principal or interest and the security will go into default and therefore it may lose value if the issuer is unable to pay interest or repay principal when it is due   junk bonds or high yield high risk securities risk bonds rated below investment grade ie bb or lower by sp or ba or lower by moodys are speculative in nature involve greater risk of default by the issuing entity and may be subject to greater market fluctuations

capital growth securities will be eliminated and the funds risks related to income producing securities will remain    board considerations and recommendations at a special meeting of the board of trustees of the trust held on september   the board considered among other matters the advisers recommendation that the funds investment objective be changed officers of the adviser made a presentation to the board and noted that over the last year or so they had noticed a growing desire among potential investors for a fund that concentrated on income and sought to protect capital they reminded the board that in may of  the funds name had been changed from the api efficient frontier core income fund to the api short term bond fund the reason for the name change had been to conform the fund more closely to the funds true investment style changing the funds investment objective as proposed would allow the short term bond fund to be a true income producing fund and would eliminate the capital growth portion of the funds portfolio the adviser reported that in its discussions with potential investors the idea of modifying the short term bond fund had been very well received the board then deliberated among themselves and sought the assistance of legal counsel and the trusts chief compliance officer after full and careful consideration the board of trustees unanimously approved the proposed investment objective and recommends that the funds shareholders vote for the proposed change of investment objective     proposal   to transact any other business
