   part i item  business our company   we are an internallymanaged maryland real estate investment trust or reit focused on providing commercial real estate financing throughout the united states  as explained below we plan to continue to opportunistically divest our nonlending businesses and assets however presently we also own and manage a portfolio of commercial real estate properties and manage real estate assets for third parties we were formed in august  and commenced operations in january    business strategy   during  we began a strategic transition to concentrate primarily on our commercial real estate or cre lending business  this is a strategic transition to a more cost efficient lower leveraged and focused business model from being a multistrategy reit which also owned and managed cre assets throughout the united states and managed our interest in irt    our transition is ongoing as we plan to continue to divest nonlending related businesses and assets as we did with the sale of our investment in irt described below  we believe that as we fully implement our strategy we will be able to enhance shareholder value by delivering stable and repeatable riskadjusted returns we plan to do that with a significantly lower expense base that matches our lending focused strategy with an appropriate capital structure and lower levels of debt   in connection with executing rait’s strategy and transformation initiative we have identified several key priorities designed to differentiate rait improve rait’s margins and enhance shareholder value over time our transformational strategy is focused on the following priorities     • concentrating rait’s business on our core middlemarket cre lending business     • opportunistically divesting and maximizing the value of rait’s legacy owned real estate or reo portfolio and ultimately minimize our reo holdings     • opportunistically divesting and maximizing the value of rait’s commercial property management business including our urban retail property management business     • optimizing rait’s capital structure and decreasing our outstanding indebtedness     • reducing rait’s total expense base and     • reallocating rait’s capital and cash proceeds from divesting our noncore assets into growing our core middlemarket commercial real estate lending activities  developments   strategic accomplishments   key accomplishments in  towards implementing our strategic transition include the following events     • sale of our investment in irt and our multifamily property management business   o rait sold the external advisor of irt and rait’s multifamily property management business to irt for  million in aggregate gross proceeds   o rait sold its irt stock ownership position to irt generating  million in aggregate gross proceeds   o rait deconsolidated irt from its financial statements   o see “irt management internalization” below for additional disclosure about these transactions     • property sales   o rait sold  properties which generated aggregate gross proceeds of  million     o after repayment of debt rait received aggregate net proceeds of approximately  million   o see “reo portfolio” below for additional disclosure about our reo portfolio      • reductions in compensation  general and administrative or ga expenses   o rait’s compensation and ga expenses were  million for the year ended december    million of which was related to discontinued operations and urban retail and would have been  million for the year ended december    million of which was related to discontinued operations and urban retail  as a result of  strategic initiatives rait’s compensation and ga expenses declined to  million for the year ended december     o reduced our number of employees by approximately  employees from approximately  employees to  employees     • debt reductions   o rait’s indebtedness based on principal amount declined by  million or  during the year ended december    total recourse debt excluding rait’s secured warehouse facilities declined by  million or  during the year ended december         • changes in company leadership and board   o rait announced a new board leadership structure and executive management changes to oversee and execute rait’s strategy and its transition to a more streamlined lendingfocused cost efficient and lower leveraged business model   o on october   rait announced that michael j malter who joined rait’s board in november  was elected by the board to serve as its independent chairman     o effective december   scott davidson rait’s president and the former head of its lending business was named rait’s chief executive officer and concurrently was appointed to the board   o on february   rait announced that thomas d wren a former banking executive and federal banking regulator had joined the board as a new independent trustee with substantial financial regulatory capital markets and mortgage reit expertise the third new trustee to join rait’s nineperson board since november      o on february   rait announced that paul w kopsky jr an accomplished executive with extensive financial and operational leadership expertise across a diverse range of industries was named to succeed james j sebra as rait’s chief financial officer and treasurer    business developments and financial results   during  we began to implement our strategy to focus on our core cre lending business line  we also managed our own reo portfolio managed thirdparty properties and assets and prior to the irt management internalization described below owned the external advisor of irt a reit which owns a portfolio of multifamily properties and approximately  of the outstanding irt common stock  these business lines business developments and our investment portfolio resulting from these business lines are described below  during  we generated gaap net income loss allocable to common shares of  million or  per common sharediluted as compared to  million or  per common sharediluted during   during  our cash available for distribution or cad decreased to  million or  per common share from  million or  per common share for   cad is a nongaap financial measure  for management’s respective definitions and discussion of the usefulness of cad to investors analysts and management and a reconciliation of our reported net income loss to our cad see part ii item  “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsnongaap financial measures”   cre lending   the core of our business is a full service cre lending platform focused on first lien loans we have a disciplined origination model centered on managing credit risk  our staff of experienced professionals gives us inhouse origination underwriting and credit capabilities with long standing relationships nationwide  we offer customized lending solutions to meet borrower needs and internal credit goals  we have extensive experience with fastmoving complex transactions and have a reputation to deliver speed and certainty of closing the loans we undertake  we offer tailored middlemarket financing solutions and a full complement of lending products for stabilized and light transition cre  we have robust credit capabilities with a full service underwriting team with a disciplined process providing an independent credit review from our originators to enhance our ability to maintain consistent credit quality     we may also offer mezzanine loans and preferred equity interests in limited circumstances to support first lien loans  these represent a small part of our cre loan portfolio and we expect to continue to limit our origination of mezzanine loans and preferred equity interests  our mezzanine loans are subordinate in repayment priority to a senior mortgage loan or loans on a property and are typically secured by pledges of ownership interests in whole or in part in the entities that own the real property we may structure our mezzanine loans so that we receive a stated fixed or variable interest rate on the loan we generate a return on our preferred equity investments primarily through distributions to us at a fixed rate and in some instances the payment of distributions may be subject to  there being sufficient net cash flow from the underlying real estate we use this investment structure as an alternative to a mezzanine loan where the financial needs and tax situation of the borrower the terms of senior financing secured by the underlying real estate or other circumstances necessitate holding preferred equity  our cre loans are in most cases nonrecourse or limited recourse loans secured by commercial real estate assets or real estate entities this means that we look primarily to the assets securing the loan for repayment subject to certain standard exceptions where possible we seek to maintain direct lending relationships with borrowers as opposed to investing in loans controlled by thirdparty lenders  we expect our origination of conduit loans to generate fee income for us when we sell the conduit loans to cmbs securitizations we expect to retain the balance of the assets in this portfolio to generate interest income for us     we rely on diverse sources of funding for our cre lending business  we are a market leader in floating rate securitization programs and have access to multiple sources of funding including senior debt convertible securities preferred securities and common securities  our strategy involves using multiple sources of shortterm financing to originate assets including warehouse facilities repurchase agreements and bank conduit facilities  our ultimate goal is to finance these investments on a longterm nonrecourse matchfunded basis or to sell these assets into cmbs securitizations match funding enables us to match the interest rates and maturities of our assets with the interest rates and maturities of our financing thereby reducing interest rate risk and funding risks in financing our portfolio on a longterm basis   since  we have sold conduit loans to unaffiliated cmbs securitizations for fee income and have sold bridge loans to securitizations we have sponsored and consolidated and for which we act as servicer and special servicer  during  we sold approximately  million of conduit loans to unaffiliated cmbs securitizations which generated fee income of  million   on november   we closed our sixth nonrecourse floating rate cmbs securitization  the transaction involved the sale by a rait subsidiary of investment grade notes totaling approximately  million with a weighted average cost of libor plus  which provided an advance rate to the rait subsidiary of approximately   as of december   rait affiliates retained all of the below investment grade and unrated subordinated interests from the securitization totaling approximately  million  in january of  we contributed all  million of these interests to a venture in which we retained a  interest and received  million of proceeds as a result of the contribution  as of december   we financed a majority of our consolidated investments in cre loans through four of these floating rate cmbs securitizations and two other loan securitizations rait cre cdo i ltd or rait i and rait preferred funding ii ltd or rait ii  in the third quarter of  we exercised our rights to unwind one of our floating rate cmbs securitizations and repaid all the notes we sponsored rait i and rait ii in  and  respectively and refer to them as our legacy cdos we characterize the notes issued by these cmbs securitizations as nonrecourse debt to us because the noteholders generally must look to the loans collateralizing their notes for repayment we serve as the servicer special servicer and collateral manager for rait i and rait ii see part ii item  “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—securitization summary” for more information about our use of cmbs financing   we may use derivative financial instruments to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our financing strategies particularly where the loans we make with the proceeds of financing we obtain are not match funded with the financing reits generally are able to enter into transactions to hedge indebtedness used to acquire real estate assets provided that the total gross income from such hedges and other nonqualifying sources does not exceed  of the reit’s total gross income   we originated  million of loans during the year ended december   consisting of  million of floatingrate bridge loans and  million of

payment of property operating expenses   please see part ii item  “financial statements and supplementary data—note  summary of significant accounting policies—revenue recognition” for further

properties as expeditiously as possible  in january of  a property that was part of a portfolio collateralizing one of these loans was sold and the proceeds from the sale were used to repay the allocated unpaid principal balance for this property of  million with the excess proceeds being applied to the remainder of the loan  also in january of  a property collateralizing a  million nonaccrual loan was refinanced with another lender  as of december   we maintained a loan loss of reserve of  million representing approximately of our nonaccrual loans     we finance our consolidated

estate properties generating gains on these sales aggregating to  million  as part of our strategy to focus on cre lending described above we entered into a securities and asset purchase agreement or the irt internalization agreement with irt on september   pursuant to which irt completed a management internalization and separation from us as we sold our interest in irt  the irt internalization agreement required irt to repurchase all of our holdings of irt common stock  on october   irt paid us approximately  million of the proceeds from an underwritten offering of irt common stock or the irt october  offering to repurchase the  shares of irt’s common stock from our subsidiaries at a purchase price of  per share  this purchase price was equal to the price to the public in the irt october  offering less underwriting discounts or commissions  as a result of the irt stock repurchase we determined that we were no longer the primary beneficiary of irt and as a result rait deconsolidated irt as of october    prior to the irt internalization agreement we identified irt as one of our business segments  the irt management internalization contemplated by the irt internalization agreement was completed on december   and consisted of two parts     • an irt affiliate purchased independence realty advisors llc or the irt advisor which was our subsidiary and irt’s external advisor and     • an irt affiliate purchased identified assets and assumed identified liabilities relating to our multifamily property management business which we refer to as rait residential including property management contracts relating to apartment properties owned by ourselves irt and third parties   the purchase price paid by irt for the irt management internalization was  million     on september   irt completed its acquisition of trade street residential inc or tsre in the tsre acquisition irt paid approximately  million in cash and issued approximately  million shares of irt common stock as consideration immediately prior to the tsre acquisition the sole third party holder of common units issued by the operating partnership of tsre or tsr op contributed all of its tsr op units to irt’s operating partnership or irop in exchange for approximately  million common units or irop units issued by irop on defined terms and conditions irop units are exchangeable for the equivalent number of shares of irt common stock or the equivalent in cash at irt’s option  during the year ended december   irt recognized a  million gain from a bargain purchase on the tsre acquisition and incurred  million of financing extinguishment and employee separation expenses in connection with the tsre acquisition  also during the year ended december   irt incurred  million of acquisition and integration expenses most of which related to the tsre acquisition   asset management and loan servicing   we manage a portfolio of real estate related assets as of december   we had  billion of assets under management or aum aum are comprised primarily of our consolidated assets and assets of third parties to which we provide property management services we serve as collateral manager or servicer and special servicer to the securitizations we consolidate as described above as a result of the irt management internalization we sold our multifamily property management business and our subsidiary serving as irt’s external adviser to irt and deconsolidated irt’s assets which contributed to the reduction of our aum by  billion during   our subsidiary urban retail properties llc or urban retail provides property management services to office and retail properties we intend to divest urban retail during  as part of our strategy to focus on cre lending  when urban retail is divested we expect that approximately  million per year would be removed from both our revenues and our expenses our employee headcount would be reduced by nearly  and our aum would be reduced by approximately  billion  see part ii item  “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—assets under management” below   targeted capital structure strategy   we have set a number of capital structure targets and key financial targets in implementing our transformational strategy described above which we expect will reconfigure our balance sheet and affect our sources of working capital  a key element involves selling noncore cre assets and reallocating our capital into and growing our core cre lending activities  we plan to increase our reliance on matchfunded assetlevel debt to finance our investments  we plan to reduce our leverage as measured by dividing the sum of our total liabilities and preferred equity by our total gross assets over time and reduce our reliance on issuing corporate debt and preferred equity  we expect to repay our legacy cdos and reallocate capital to more efficient vehicles    certain reit and investment company act limits on our strategies   reit limits   we conduct our operations to qualify as a reit we also conduct the operations of our subsidiaries taberna realty finance trust or trft raitmelody  holdings trust or melody fl and any reits we may sponsor or otherwise consolidate in the future which we collectively refer to as our reit affiliates to each qualify as a reit please see part ii item  “financial statements and supplementary data—note  income taxes” for further discussion our exit of our taberna securitization segment in  did not involve selling trft which continues to hold assets and liabilities unrelated to the taberna segment for a discussion of the tax implications of our and our reit affiliates’ reit status to us and our shareholders see “material us federal income tax considerations” contained in exhibit  to this annual report on form k to qualify as a reit we and our reit affiliates must continually satisfy various tests regarding sources of income nature and diversification of assets amounts distributed to shareholders and the ownership of common shares in order to satisfy these tests we and our reit affiliates may be required to forgo investments that might otherwise be made accordingly compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our or our reit affiliates’ investment performance these requirements include the following   • for each of ourselves and our reit affiliates at least  of total assets and  of gross income must be derived from qualifying real estate assets whether or not such assets would otherwise represent our or our reit affiliates’ best investment alternative for example since our investments in the debt or equity of certain securitizations are not qualifying real estate assets to the extent that we have historically invested in such assets or may do so in the future we must hold substantial investments in qualifying real estate assets including mortgage loans and cmbs which may have lower yields than such investments also at least  of each of our and our reit affiliates’ gross income in each taxable year excluding gross income from prohibited transactions must be derived from some combination of income that qualifies under the  gross income test described above as well as other dividends interest and gain from the sale or disposition of shares or securities which need not have any relation to real property   • a reit’s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a  penalty tax in general prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property other than foreclosure property but including any mortgage loans held in inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business the prohibited transaction tax may apply to any sale of assets to a securitization and to any sale of securitization securities and therefore may limit our and our reit affiliates’ ability to sell assets to or equity in securitizations and other assets   • overall no more than  of the value of a reit’s assets may consist of securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries or trss during  we restructured certain of our trs entities by moving four former separate trss under a single trs holding company rait jv trs sub llc in order to streamline our business operations and decrease administrative processes after the sale of irt advisors and our multifamily property management business in the irt management internalizaiton transaction our trss that currently hold assets include rait jv trs sub llc the holding company for our interest in rait urban holdings llc the entities that issued our junior subordinated notes and the entity party to our cmbs facilities referred to below taberna equity funding ltd the holding company for equity issued by a securitization and rait sharpstown trs llc the holding company for a  ownership interest of a retail center located in houston texas  our and our reit affiliates’ ability to grow or expand the feegenerating businesses held in a trss as well as the business of future trss we or our reit affiliates may form will be limited by our and our reit affiliates’ need to meet this  test   • the reit provisions of the internal revenue code limit our and our reit affiliates’ ability to hedge mortgagebacked securities preferred securities and related borrowings except to the extent provided by the regulations promulgated by the us treasury department or the treasury regulations any income from a hedging transaction we or our reit affiliates enter into in the normal course of business primarily to manage risk of interest rate or price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made or ordinary obligations incurred or to be incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets which is clearly identified as specified in the treasury regulations before the close of the day on which it was acquired originated or entered into including gain from the sale or disposition of such a transaction will not constitute gross income for purposes of the  gross income test and will generally constitute nonqualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test to the extent that we or our reit affiliates enter into other types of hedging transactions the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests as a result we or our reit affiliates might have to limit use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through trss this could increase the cost of our or our reit affiliates’ hedging activities or expose it or us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we or it would otherwise want to bear   there are other risks arising out of our and our reit affiliates’ need to comply with reit requirements see item a—“risk factorstax risks” below    investment company act limits   we seek to conduct our operations so that we are not required to register as an investment company under section a of the investment company act a company is not deemed to be an “investment company” if   • it neither is nor holds itself out as being engaged primarily nor proposes to engage primarily in the business of investing reinvesting or trading in securities and   • it neither is engaged nor proposes to engage in the business of investing reinvesting owning holding or trading in securities and does not own or propose to acquire “investment securities” having a value exceeding  of the value of its total assets exclusive of government securities and cash items on an unconsolidated basis which we refer to as the  test “investment securities” excludes us government securities and securities of majorityowned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company under section c or section c of the investment company act relating to issuers whose securities are held by not more than  persons or whose securities are held only by qualified purchasers as defined   we rely on the  test because we are a holding company that conducts our businesses through whollyowned or majorityowned subsidiaries as a result the securities issued by our subsidiaries that are excepted from the definition of “investment company” under section c or section c of the investment company act together with any other investment securities we may own may not have a combined value in excess of  of the value of our total assets exclusive of government securities and cash items on an unconsolidated basis based on the relative value of our investment in trft on the one hand and our investment in rait partnership on the other hand we can comply with the  test only if rait partnership itself complies with the  test or an exemption other than those provided by sections c or c because the principal exemptions that rait partnership relies upon to allow it to meet the  test are those provided by sections cc or c relating to subsidiaries primarily engaged in specified real estate activities we are limited in the types of businesses in which we may engage through our subsidiaries   none of rait rait partnership or any of their subsidiaries has received a noaction letter from the securities and exchange commission or sec regarding whether it complies with the investment company act or how its investment or financing strategies fit within the exclusions from regulation under the investment company act that it is using to the extent that the sec provides more specific or different guidance regarding for example the treatment of assets as qualifying real estate assets or real estaterelated assets we may be required to adjust these investment and financing strategies accordingly see item a—“risk factors—other regulatory and legal risks of our business loss of our investment company act exemption would affect us adversely”   competition   we are subject to significant competition in all aspects of our business existing industry participants and potential new entrants compete with us for the available supply of investments suitable for origination or acquisition as well as for debt and equity capital we are seeing increasing amounts of competition from new entrants in the market to originate conduit loans and bridge loans which may reduce our return on making new conduit loans and bridge loans we compete with many third parties engaged in real estate finance and investment activities including other reits specialty finance companies savings and loan associations banks mortgage bankers insurance companies mutual funds institutional investors lenders governmental bodies and other entities with respect to our investments in real estate we face significant competition from other owners operators and developers of properties many of which own properties similar to ours in markets where we operate competition may increase and other companies and funds with investment objectives similar to ours may be organized in the future some of these competitors have or in the future may have substantially greater financial resources than we do and generally may be able to accept more risk they may also enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from among other things a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies in addition competition may lead us to pay a greater portion of the origination fees that we expect to collect in our future origination activities to thirdparty investment banks and brokers that introduce borrowers to us in order to continue to generate new business from these sources with respect to our urban retail property management businesses we face competition from other property managers with respect to properties owned by unaffiliated third parties primarily retail properties   employees   as of march   we had  employees and believe our relationships with our employees to be good none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement   available information   we file annual quarterly and current reports proxy

material from our website   item a risk factors   shareholders should carefully consider the following risk factors in conjunction with the other information contained in this report the risks discussed in this report could adversely affect our business operating results prospects and financial condition this could cause the value of our common shares and other securities to decline andor you to lose part or all of any investment in our securities the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face but do represent those risks and uncertainties that we believe are material to us additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that as of the date of this report we deem immaterial may also harm our business some statements in this report including statements in the following risk factors constitute forwardlooking statements please refer to “forwardlooking statements” above in this report   risks related to our business and operations   general risks   changes in general economic conditions may adversely affect our business   our business and operations depend on the commercial real estate industry generally which in turn depends upon broad economic conditions in the us and abroad a worsening of economic conditions would likely have a negative impact on the commercial real estate industry generally and on our business and operations specifically additionally disruptions in the global economy may also have a negative impact on the commercial real estate market domestically adverse conditions in the commercial real estate industry could harm our business and financial condition by among other factors reducing the value of our existing assets limiting our access to debt and equity capital limiting our ability to originate new commercial real estate debt or acquire or finance investments in real estate and otherwise negatively impacting our operations  see part ii item  “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations trends that may affect our business” for a description of some of the specific economic trends that may affect our business   loss of our management team or the ability to attract and retain key employees could harm our business   the real estate finance business is very laborintensive we depend on our management team to manage our investments and attract customers for financing by among other things developing relationships with issuers financial institutions and others the market for skilled personnel is highly competitive and has historically experienced a high rate of turnover due to the nature of our business we compete for qualified personnel not only with companies in our business but also in other sectors of the financial services industry competition for qualified personnel may lead to increased hiring and retention costs we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract or retain qualified personnel at reasonable costs or at all if we are unable to attract or retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel at manageable costs it could impair our ability to manage our investments and execute our investment strategies successfully thereby reducing our earnings   the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of our transformation plan and execution of our strategy  including our transition to a more focused costefficient and lower leveraged business concentrated on our core commercial real estate lending business  could adversely impact our business and financial results   we are pursuing a comprehensive strategy and transformation initiative to drive longterm shareholder value pursuant to this initiative we are transforming into a more focused costefficient and lower leveraged business concentrated on our core commercial real estate lending business in connection with executing this strategy and transformation initiative we have identified several key priorities designed to differentiate rait improve our cost structure and enhance shareholder value over time by delivering stable and repeatable riskadjusted returns our transformational strategy is focused on the following priorities i concentrate our business on our core middlemarket commercial real estate lending business ii opportunistically divest and maximize the value of our legacy reo portfolio and ultimately minimize our reo holdings iii opportunistically divest and maximize the value of our commercial property management business including the divesture of our urban retail property management business iv optimize our capital structure and reduce our outstanding indebtedness v reduce our total expense base and vi reallocate our capital and cash proceeds from divesting our noncore assets into growing our core middlemarket commercial real estate lending activities   as an organization we may not have the capacity or ability to successfully accomplish all of the priorities we have identified for our strategy and transformation initiative in the timeframe we desire or at all in addition the strategy may not yield the results we currently anticipate or results that will exceed those that might be obtained under our prior strategy particularly if we fail to  successfully execute on one or more of the priorities we have identified for our strategy even if we successfully implement one or more other priorities as a result we may not be able to implement and realize the anticipated benefits from our strategy   events and circumstances such as financial or unforeseen difficulties market disruptions delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing desired outcomes  if we fail to implement our strategy in accordance with our expectations or achieve some or all of the expected benefits of these activities it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition even if we successfully implement our strategy we still may not realize its anticipated benefits even if we implement our strategy in accordance with our expectations and the anticipated benefits are substantially realized there may be consequences or business impacts that were not expected   additionally our strategy will bring additional risks to the business such as an increased dependence on our core lending business which could result in the existing risks associated with that business being magnified   further as a result of our business transformation plan and the streamlining of our business contemplated thereby we may experience a loss of continuity loss of accumulated knowledge or loss of efficiency during transitional periods the execution of our transformation plan can require a significant amount of management and other employees’ time and focus which may divert attention from daytoday operating activities and growing our business   our transformation plan contemplates that we will sell certain businesses that are no longer central to our strategic objectives such as our urban retail property management business  our transformation plan also contemplates that we will opportunistically divest and maximize the value of our legacy reo portfolio and ultimately minimize our reo holdings any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition risks related to obtaining necessary government or regulatory approvals risks related to retained liabilities not subject to our control and risks related to the need to provide transition services to the disposed business which may result in the diversion of resources and focus   actions of activist shareholders against us could be disruptive and costly and the possibility that activist shareholders may wage proxy contests or seek representation on or control of our board could cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business and an activist campaign that results in a change in control of our board could trigger change in control provisions or payments under certain of our material contracts and agreements   shareholders may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations advance shareholder proposals or board nominations or otherwise attempt to effect changes assert influence or acquire some level of control over us  on february   highland select equity master fund lp an affiliate of highland capital management lp a delaware limited partnership or highland purported to notify the company that it intends to nominate five  candidates for election to our board at our  annual meeting of shareholders or the  annual meeting which if elected would represent more than a majority of the members of our board according to the schedule d filed with the sec by highland and its affiliates on february   highland and its affiliates beneficially own approximately  of our outstanding common stock on february   highland and its affiliates filed with the sec soliciting material under rule a of the exchange act confirming their intention to file a preliminary proxy statement and an accompanying proxy card with the sec to solicit votes for the election of its slate of five trustee nominees to our board at the  annual meeting   while our board and management team strive to maintain constructive ongoing communications with all of the company’s shareholders including highland and welcomes their views and opinions with the goal of enhancing value for all shareholders and the depth and breadth of our board an activist campaign such as the proxy contest threatened by highland and seeks to replace more than a majority of the members of our board and thereby seek control of the company could have an adverse effect on us because     • responding to such actions by activist shareholders can disrupt our operations are costly and timeconsuming and divert the attention of our board and senior management team from the pursuit of business strategies which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition     • perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of changes to the composition of our board may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors cause concern to our current or potential clients may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners     • these types of actions could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business     • if individuals are elected to our board with a specific agenda it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategy and create additional value for our shareholders and      • if a proxy contest by an activist investor that seeks to replace at least a majority of the members of the board such as the proxy contest that is currently being threatened by highland was successful a change in control of the board may be deemed to have occurred under certain of our material contracts and agreements and such a change in control may trigger certain fundamental change andor change in control provisions payments andor redemptions under certain of our outstanding indebtedness our employment agreements with our named executive officers our equity compensation plans and possibly other of our plans and agreements    our succession planning to address the substantial changes to our management resulting from the irt management internalization may be insufficient or take a longer period than we anticipate which would reduce the effectiveness of the management of our business and increase exposure to disruption if members of current management become unavailable unexpectedly   rait has a limited number of executive officers and rait has changed its chief executive officer or ceo and chief financial officer or cfo as a result of the irt management internalization  rait is identifying additional persons to serve in executive officer roles in order to enhance its succession planning but leadership talent within rait may not be sufficiently developed and recruitment outside rait may not occur within expected time frames to provide for orderly succession in the future which could reduce the effectiveness of the management of our business overall or particular business functions and increase exposure to disruption if members of current management become unexpectedly unavailable   we may not maximize our business performance by effectively prioritizing allocation of capital among our types of investments in cre loans or balancing these types of investments in a strategic context which may adversely affect our financial performance   in executing our strategic plan to focus on cre lending we regularly consider the allocation of capital to our various types of investments in cre loans the allocation of capital among such investments may vary due to market conditions the expected relative return on equity of each type of investment the judgment of our management team the demand in the marketplace for cre loans and the availability of specific investment opportunities we also consider the availability and cost of our likely sources of capital if we fail to appropriately allocate capital and resources across our types of investments in cre loans or fail to optimize our investment and capital raising opportunities our financial performance may be adversely affected   as a result of the irt management internalization we have made and expect to continue to make substantial changes to our management and incur significant expenses related thereto which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   as a result of the irt management internalization scott f schaeffer resigned as our ceo and scott l n davidson who was rait’s president became our ceo as well  in addition james j sebra our cfo is expected to resign from such position upon the later to occur of march   or the filing of rait’s form k for the fiscal year ended december   with the sec and will be replaced by paul w kopsky jr as described above our stock price may be adversely affected by market uncertainty concerning our management transition we may incur substantial severance and recruitment costs we are required to provide and entitled to receive services under a shared services agreement with irt and may be adversely affected if we do not provide or receive services at the levels required or to which we are entitled our general and administrative expenses after the irt management internalization could be higher than our current expectations any of these foregoing risks could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the irt management internalization   we intend for the irt management internalization to be part of our long term strategy of focusing on our core strategy of commercial real estate lending and reallocating capital to the higher yielding lending business and reducing leverage we may not be able to identify suitable investments for a period of time which may reduce our operating performance  following the irt management internalization we are reliant on irt for certain transitional services under the shared services agreement with irt for a period of time after the closing which occurred on december   if we are unable to internalize or find other providers for these services within a reasonable time period we may not achieve all of the expected benefits of the irt management internalization the failure to manage the irt management internalization effectively including failure to smoothly transition services or retain employees could result in the anticipated benefits of the irt management internalization not being realized in the timeframe currently anticipated or at all or may require incurring higher expenses than we currently anticipate        the irt management internalization was negotiated between a special committee of the board of trustees comprised solely of independent trustees or the special committee and a special committee of the irt board of directors comprised solely of independent directors or the irt special committee to address potential conflicts of interest among executive officers shared by rait and irt   the irt management internalization was negotiated by the special committee on behalf of rait with the irt special committee on behalf of irt in order for rait and irt to address potential conflicts of interest among executive officers shared by rait and irt including the following i mr schaeffer’s service as ceo of both rait and irt and as chairman of the rait board of trustees and as chairman of the irt board of directors and ii mr sebra’s service as cfo and treasurer of both rait and irt as a result the affiliated officers may have had different interests than we do with respect to the irt management internalization and the future conduct of the businesses of the companies while the special committee was responsible for negotiating on behalf of rait to address potential conflicts of interest related to the irt management internalization including those of the affiliated officers these potential conflicts would not exist in the case of a transaction negotiated with unaffiliated third parties   the representations warranties covenants and indemnities in the irt internalization agreement and related agreements are subject to limitations and qualifiers which may limit our ability to enforce any remedy under these agreements   the representations warranties covenants and indemnities in the irt internalization agreement the related shared services agreement and other agreements related to the irt management internalization are subject to limitations and qualifiers which may limit our ability to enforce any remedy under these agreements  these include without limitation limitations on liability and materiality qualifiers on certain representations and covenants   we may not be able to hire and retain qualified loan originators or grow and maintain our relationships with key loan brokers and if we are unable to do so our ability to implement our business and growth strategies could be limited   we depend on our loan originators to generate borrower clients by among other things developing relationships with commercial property owners real estate agents and brokers developers loan brokers and others which we believe leads to repeat and referral business accordingly we must be able to attract motivate and retain skilled loan originators the market for loan originators is highly competitive and may lead to increased costs to hire and retain them we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract or retain qualified loan originators if we cannot attract motivate or retain a sufficient number of skilled loan originators at a reasonable cost or at all our business could be materially and adversely affected we also depend on our network of loan brokers who generate a significant portion of our loan originations while we strive to cultivate longstanding relationships that generate repeat business for us brokers are free to transact business with other lenders and have done so in the past and will do so in the future our competitors also have relationships with some of our brokers and actively compete with us in bidding on loans shopped by these brokers we also cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain or develop new relationships with additional brokers   in addition to other analytical tools our management team utilizes financial models to evaluate loans and real estate assets the accuracy and effectiveness of which cannot be guaranteed   in all cases financial models are only estimates of future results which are based upon assumptions made at the time that the projections are developed there can be no assurance that management’s projected results will be obtained actual results may vary significantly from the projections general economic and industryspecific conditions which are not predictable can significantly impact the reliability of projections   our board of trustees may change our policies without shareholder consent   our board of trustees reviews our policies developed by management and in particular our investment policies our board of trustees may amend our policies or approve transactions that deviate from these policies without a vote of or notice to our shareholders policy changes could adversely affect the market price of our shares and our ability to make distributions our board of trustees cannot take any action to disqualify us as a reit or to otherwise revoke our election to be taxed as a reit without the approval of a majority of our outstanding voting shares   our organizational documents do not limit our ability to enter into new lines of business and we may enter into new businesses make future strategic investments or acquisitions or enter into joint ventures each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our business   our organizational documents do not limit us to our current business lines accordingly we may pursue growth through strategic investments acquisitions or joint ventures which may include entering into new lines of business in addition we expect opportunities will arise to acquire other companies including reits managers of investment products or originators of real estate  debt to the extent we make strategic investments or acquisitions enter into joint ventures or enter into a new line of business we will face numerous risks and uncertainties including risks associated with     • the required investment of capital and other resources     • the possibility that we have insufficient expertise to engage in such activities profitably or without incurring inappropriate amounts of risk     • combining or integrating operational and management systems and controls and     • compliance with applicable regulatory requirements including those required under the internal revenue code and the investment company act   entry into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar or from which we are currently exempt and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk if a new business generates insufficient revenue or if we are unable to efficiently manage our expanded operations our results of operations will be adversely affected in the case of joint ventures we are subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may be dependent upon and subject to liability losses or reputation damage relating to systems controls and personnel that are not under our control   we operate in a highly competitive market which may harm our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations   historically we have been subject to significant competition in all of our business lines we compete with many third parties engaged in finance and real estate investment activities including other reits specialty finance companies savings and loan associations banks mortgage bankers insurance companies mutual funds institutional investors investment banking firms and brokerdealers property managers investment advisers lenders governmental bodies and other entities some of these competitors have or in the future may have substantially greater financial resources than we do and generally may be able to accept more risk as such they have the ability to make larger loans and to reduce the risk of loss from any one loan by having a more diversified loan portfolio they may also enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from among other things a lower cost of and greater access to capital and enhanced operating efficiencies an increase in the general availability of funds to lenders or a decrease in the amount of borrowing activity may increase competition for making loans and may reduce obtainable yields or increase the credit risk inherent in the available loans   competition may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us it may also result in higher prices lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms and reducing the fee income we realize from the origination structuring and management of securitizations it may also make it more difficult to obtain appreciation interests and increase the price and thus reduce potential yields on discounted loans we acquire   we face significant competition in our investments in real estate from other owners operators and developers of properties many of which own properties similar to ours in markets where we operate such competition may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants and reduce the rents we are able to charge these competing properties may have vacancy rates higher than our properties which may result in their owners being willing to rent space at lower rental rates than we would or providing greater tenant improvement allowances or other leasing concessions this combination of circumstances could adversely affect our revenues and financial performance   we engage in transactions with related parties and our policies and procedures regarding these transactions may be insufficient to address any conflicts of interest that may arise   under our code of business conduct we have established procedures regarding the review approval and ratification of transactions which may give rise to a conflict of interest between us and any employee officer trustee their immediate family members other businesses under their control and other related persons in the ordinary course of our business operations we have ongoing relationships and have engaged in transactions with several related entities these procedures do not guarantee that all potential conflicts will be identified reviewed or sufficiently addressed     our transactions with and investments in some securitization vehicles may create perceived or actual conflicts of interest   we have engaged in transactions with and invested in certain of the securitization vehicles under which we also serve as collateral manager servicer andor special servicer and may do so in the future these transactions have included and may include in the future surrendering for cancellation notes we hold issued by these vehicles and exchanges of our or others’ securities with these  vehicles for assets collateralizing these vehicles in addition we have previously and may in the future purchase investments in these vehicles that are senior or junior to or have rights and interests different from or adverse to other investors or credit support providers in the debt or other securities of such securitization vehicles such situations may create perceived or actual conflicts of interest between us and such other investors or credit support providers for such investors our interests in such transactions and investments may conflict with the interests of such other investors or credit support providers at the time of origination or in the event of a default or restructuring of a securitization vehicle or underlying assets   furthermore if we are involved in structuring the securitization vehicles or such securitization vehicles are structured as our subsidiaries then our managers may have conflicts between us and other entities managed by them that purchase debt or other securities in such securitization vehicles with regard to setting subordination levels determining interest rates pricing the securities providing for divesting or deferring distributions that would otherwise be made to equity interests or otherwise setting the amounts and priorities of distributions to the holders of debt and equity interests in the securitization vehicles   although we seek to make decisions with respect to our securitization vehicles in a manner that we believe is fair and consistent with the operative legal documents governing these vehicles perceived or actual conflicts may create dissatisfaction among the other investors in such vehicles or litigation or regulatory enforcement actions appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and our reputation could be damaged if we fail to deal appropriately with one or more perceived or actual conflicts of interest regulatory scrutiny of or litigation in connection with such conflicts of interest could materially adversely affect our ability to manage or generate income or cash flow from our securitizations business cause harm to our reputation and adversely affect our ability to attract investors for future vehicles   quarterly results may fluctuate and may not be indicative of future quarterly performance   our quarterly operating results could fluctuate therefore you should not rely on past quarterly results to be indicative of our performance in future quarters factors that could cause quarterly operating results to fluctuate include among others variations in our investment origination volume variations in the timing of repayments of debt financing variations in the timing of property sales variations in the amount of time between our receipt of the proceeds of a securities offering and our investment of those proceeds in loans or other assets market conditions that result in increased cost of funds or material fluctuations in the fair value of our assets and liabilities the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets general economic conditions and other factors referred to elsewhere in this section     terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the real estate industry generally and our business financial condition and results of operations   we cannot predict the severity of the effect that potential future terrorist attacks could have on us any future terrorist attacks the anticipation of any such attacks the consequences of any military or other response by the united states and its allies and other armed conflicts could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united states and worldwide financial markets and economy we may suffer losses as a result of the adverse impact of any future attacks and these losses may adversely impact our performance a prolonged economic slowdown a recession or declining real estate values could impair the performance of our assets and harm our financial condition and results of operations increase our funding costs limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us the economic impact of such events could also adversely affect the credit quality of some of our loans and investments and the property underlying our securities losses resulting from these types of events may not be fully insurable   the events of september   created significant uncertainty regarding the ability of real estate owners of high profile assets to obtain insurance coverage protecting against terrorist attacks at commercially reasonable rates if at all with the enactment of the terrorism risk insurance act of  the “tria” and subsequent extensions including the enactment of the terrorism risk insurance program reauthorization act of  which extends tria through december   insurers must make terrorism insurance available under their property and casualty insurance policies but this legislation does not regulate the pricing of such insurance the absence of affordable insurance coverage may adversely affect the general real estate lending market lending volume and the market’s overall liquidity and may reduce the number of suitable opportunities available to us and the pace at which we are able to acquire assets if the properties underlying our interests are unable to obtain affordable insurance coverage the value of our interests could decline and in the event of an uninsured loss we could lose all or a portion of our assets   we are subject to risks of loss from weather conditions manmade or natural disasters and climate change   weather conditions and manmade or natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes floods droughts fires and other environmental conditions can damage properties that collateralize our loans or that we own additionally the value of such properties will potentially be subject to the risks associated with longterm effects of climate change future weather conditions manmade or natural disasters or effects of climate change could adversely impact the demand for and value of our assets and could also  directly impact the value of our assets through damage destruction or loss and could thereafter materially impact the availability or cost of insurance to protect against these events although we believe the properties collateralizing our loan assets and our remaining owned real estate are adequately covered by insurance we cannot predict at this time if we or our borrowers will be able to obtain appropriate coverage at a reasonable cost in the future or if we will be able to continue to pass along all of the costs of insurance to our tenants any weather conditions manmade or natural disasters or effect of climate change whether or not insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance the market price of our common shares and our ability to pay dividends in addition there is a risk that one or more of our property insurers may not be able to fulfill their obligations with respect to claims payments due to a deterioration in its financial condition   cybersecurity threats or other security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our employees borrowers lessees clients and other counterparties and could harm our business and our reputation   we store sensitive data including our proprietary business information and that of our borrowers lessees clients and other counterparties and confidential employee information in our data centers and on our networks despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures furthermore in the operation of our business we also use thirdparty vendors that store certain sensitive data including confidential information about our employees and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats any security breach of our own or a thirdparty vendor’s systems could cause us to be noncompliant with applicable laws or regulations subject us to legal claims or proceedings disrupt our operations damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services any of which could adversely affect our business   risks related to our financing strategy   we rely on outside sources of capital to maintain our liquidity and any restrictions on our ability to access these sources would materially adversely affect our financial performance   we require significant outside capital to fund and grow our businesses a primary source of liquidity for us has been the equity and debt capital markets including sales of loans to securitizations repurchase agreements issuances of common equity preferred equity and convertible senior notes our origination and sales of conduit loans currently depends on our ability to access short term financing through repurchase agreements followed by sales to unaffiliated thirdparty sponsored cmbs securitizations our origination of bridge loans currently depends on our ability to access short term financing through repurchase agreements followed by our ability to use these loans to collateralize securitizations we sponsor and have these securitizations issue debt to unaffiliated investors if these financing sources were no longer available for these types of assets our ability to originate these assets and our returns from these assets might be limited or gone in general our financial performance would be materially adversely affected if our access to liquidity were restricted whether by economic conditions or capital market developments affecting commercial real estate or our historical sources of financing or for any other reason if we fail to secure financing on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts our income may be reduced since our ability to originate loans acquire properties and make other investments would be limited or eliminated we depend on our portfolio of investments to generate cad and any significant restriction on our liquidity could impair our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders we cannot assure you that any or sufficient funding or capital will be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us for information about our available sources of funds refer to part ii item  “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources” and the notes to the consolidated financial statements located in part ii item  of this annual report on form k   our business is highly leveraged which could lead to greater losses than if we were not as leveraged   we do and in the future intend to use financial leverage in executing our business plan such borrowings may take the form of “financing facilities” such as bank credit facilities credit facilities from government agencies repurchase agreements and warehouse lines of credit which are secured revolving lines of credit that we utilize to warehouse portfolios or real estate instruments until we exit them through securitization or other means we do and in the future intend to enter into securitization and other longterm financing transactions to use the proceeds from such transactions to reduce the outstanding balances under these financing facilities however such agreements may include a recourse component further any financing facilities that we currently have or may use in the future to finance our assets may require us to provide additional collateral or pay down debt if the market value of our assets pledged or sold to the provider of the credit facility or the repurchase agreement counterparty decline in value in addition our borrowings are generally based on floating interest rates the fluctuation of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations our use of leverage in a market that moves adversely to our business interests could result in a substantial loss to us which would be greater than if we were not leveraged    there can be no assurance that we will be able to utilize financing arrangements in the future on favorable terms or at all   there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain maintain or renew our financing facilities on terms favorable to us or at all furthermore any financing facility that we enter into will be subject to conditions and restrictive covenants relating to our operations which may inhibit our ability to grow our business and increase revenues to the extent we breach a covenant or cannot satisfy a condition such facility may not be available to us or may be required to be repaid in full or in part which could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies further such borrowings may limit the length of time during which any given asset may be used as eligible collateral   additionally if we are unable to securitize our loans to replenish a warehouse line of credit we may be required to seek other forms of potentially less attractive financing or otherwise to liquidate our assets furthermore some of our warehouse lines of credit contain crossdefault provisions if a default occurs under one of these warehouse lines of credit and the lenders terminate one or more of these agreements we may need to enter into replacement agreements with different lenders there can be no assurance that we will be successful in entering into such replacement agreements on the same terms as the terminated warehouse line of credit   we or securitizations we sponsor may issue more unsecured corporate bonds in the future depending on the financing requirements of our business and market conditions our failure to maintain the credit ratings on the debt securities so issued could negatively affect our ability to access capital and could increase our interest expense the credit rating agencies may periodically review our or such securitizations capital structure and the quality and stability of the relevant cash flows deterioration in such capital structure or the quality and stability of such cash flows could result in a downgrade of the credit ratings on such debt securities any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to us and could limit our access to funding for our operations we depend upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive if our ability to access capital becomes constrained our interest costs could increase which could have material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows   our reliance on debt to finance investments may require us to make balloon payments upon maturity upon the exercise of any applicable put rights or otherwise and an increased risk of loss may reduce our return on investments reduce our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders and possibly result in the foreclosure of any assets subject to secured financing   we have historically incurred debt to finance our investments which could compound losses and reduce our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders our debt service payments could reduce the net income available for distributions to our shareholders and reduce our liquidity available to make distributions to our shareholders each calendar year that are required for reit qualification most of our assets are pledged as collateral for borrowings in addition the assets of the securitizations that we consolidate collateralize the debt obligations of the securitizations and are not available to satisfy our other creditors to the extent that we fail to meet debt service obligations we risk the loss of some or all of our respective assets to foreclosure or sale to satisfy these debt obligations currently our declaration of trust and bylaws do not impose any limitations on the extent to which we may leverage our respective assets   we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flows will be insufficient to meet required principal and interest payments and the risk that we will be unable to refinance our indebtedness when it becomes due or that the terms of such refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of our indebtedness included in our debt instruments are provisions providing for the lump sum payment of significant amounts of principal whether upon maturity upon the exercise of any applicable put rights or otherwise which we refer to as balloon payments most of our debt provides for balloon payments that are payable at maturity if collateral underlying any secured credit facility we are party to defaults or otherwise fails to meet specified conditions we may have to repay that facility to the extent it was secured by that collateral our ability to make these payments when due will depend upon several factors which may not be in our control these factors include our liquidity or our ability to convert assets owned by us into liquidity on or prior to such put or maturity dates and the amount by which we have been able to reduce indebtedness prior to such put or maturity date though exchanges refinancing extensions collateralization or other similar transactions any of which transactions may also have the effect of reducing liquidity or liquid assets our ability to accomplish these goals will be affected by various factors existing at the relevant time such as the state of the national and regional economies local real estate conditions available interest rate levels the lease terms for and equity in any related collateral our financial condition and the operating history of the collateral if we are unable to pay redeem restructure refinance extend or otherwise enter into transactions to satisfy any of our debt this could result in defaults under and acceleration of our debt and we may be required to sell assets in significant amounts and at times when market conditions are not favorable which could result in our incurring significant losses    holders of our outstanding convertible senior notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or part of their notes on specified dates and under specified conditions and any such repurchases will reduce our liquidity and may require us to generate additional liquidity which may be less favorable to us than the terms of the convertible senior notes repurchased and so adversely affect our financial performance   holders of our  convertible senior notes due  or the  notes have the right to require us to repurchase for cash all or part of their notes on each of april   april   and april   at a repurchase price equal to  of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the relevant repurchase date in addition holders of our  convertible senior notes due  or the  notes have the right to require us to repurchase for cash all or part of their notes on each of october   october   and october   at a repurchase price equal to  of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the relevant repurchase date in addition if we undergo a defined fundamental change holders of the  notes and the  notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of their notes at a repurchase price equal to  of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the fundamental change repurchase date any such repurchases will reduce our liquidity and may require us to generate additional liquidity which may be less favorable to us than the terms of the convertible senior notes repurchased and so adversely affect our financial performance   our issuance of series d preferred shares with redemption rights and warrants and share appreciation rights with put rights may increase our risk of loss if we need to satisfy these redemption rights and put rights   we have issued our series d preferred shares of beneficial interest which provide a holder with redemption rights in defined circumstances and warrants and share appreciation rights which have put rights in defined circumstances while these series d preferred shares and such warrants and share appreciation rights provide that any exercise of such redemption and put rights may be satisfied by rait issuing a note the exercise of these redemption and put rights may adversely affect our liquidity and reduce amounts available for distribution to our shareholders events which have occurred or may occur in the future may come within the circumstances giving rise to such redemption and put rights in addition rait must redeem the series d preferred shares with up to  million of net proceeds received from the loans and other investments made with the proceeds of the issuance of the series d preferred shares this redemption provision is effective beginning in october  in the case of net proceeds received by rait from the sale or payoff of investments other than cmbs loans and beginning in october  includes net proceeds received by rait from the sale or payoff of cmbs loans in each case at a redemption price of  per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends the net proceeds used in these redemptions may not be sufficient to redeem the series d preferred shares or may otherwise adversely affect our liquidity and reduce amounts available for distribution to our shareholders   the securities purchase agreement related to the series d preferred shares restricts our ability to make certain distributions to our shareholders   the securities purchase agreement pursuant to which the series d preferred shares were issued includes an agreement by rait not to declare any extraordinary dividend except as otherwise required for rait to continue to satisfy the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit an extraordinary dividend is defined as any dividend or other distribution a on common shares other than regular quarterly dividends on the common shares or b on the preferred shares other than in respect of dividends accrued in accordance with the terms expressly applicable to the preferred shares     we may seek to acquire redeem restructure refinance or otherwise enter into transactions to satisfy our debt which may include any combination of material payments of cash issuances of our debt andor equity securities sales or exchanges of our assets or other methods   from time to time our collateralized debt obligation or cdo notes payable convertible senior notes senior notes and our other indebtedness may trade at discounts to their respective face amounts in order to reduce future cash interest payments as well as future principal amounts due upon any applicable put dates at maturity or upon redemption or to otherwise benefit rait we may from time to time purchase such cdo notes payable convertible senior notes senior notes or other indebtedness for cash in exchange for our equity or debt securities or for any combination of cash and our equity or debt securities in each case in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions exchange offers and consent solicitations or otherwise we will evaluate any such transactions in light of thenexisting market conditions contractual restrictions and other factors taking into account our current liquidity and prospects for future access to capital the amounts involved in any such transactions individually or in the aggregate may be material and may materially reduce our liquidity or reduce or eliminate our ability to convert assets into liquidity any material issuances of our equity securities may have a material dilutive effect on our current shareholders    our financing arrangements contain covenants that restrict our operations and any default under these arrangements would inhibit our ability to grow our business increase revenue and pay distributions to our shareholders   our financing arrangements contain restrictions covenants and events of default failure to meet or satisfy any of these covenants could result in an event of default under these agreements these agreements may contain cross default provisions so that an event of default under one agreement will trigger an event of default under other agreements defaults generally give our lenders the right to declare all amounts outstanding under their particular credit agreement to be immediately due and payable and enforce their rights by foreclosing on or otherwise liquidating collateral pledged under these agreements these restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain financing or to engage in other business activities furthermore our default under any of our financing arrangements could materially reduce our liquidity and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders   a decline in the market value of the assets we finance pursuant to repurchase agreements or warehouse facilities may result in margin calls that may force us to sell assets under adverse market conditions   our current repurchase agreements allow and we expect any warehouse facilities and repurchase agreements we enter into in the future to allow our lender to make margin calls that would require us to make cash payments or deliver additional assets to our lender in the event that there is a decline in the market value of the assets that collateralize our repurchase agreements or debt under our warehouse facilities as a result a decline in the market value of assets collateralizing any such debt may result in our lenders initiating margin calls and requiring a pledge of additional collateral or cash posting additional collateral or cash to support our borrowings would reduce our liquidity and limit our ability to leverage our assets which could adversely affect our business as a result we could be forced to sell some of our assets in order to maintain liquidity forced sales typically result in lower sales prices than do market sales made in the normal course of business if our investments were liquidated at prices below the amortized cost basis of such investments we would incur losses which could result in a rapid deterioration of our financial condition   we are exposed to loss if lenders under our repurchase agreements warehouse facilities or other shortterm debt liquidate the portfolio assets collateralizing or otherwise providing credit support for such debt moreover assets financed by us pursuant to our repurchase agreements warehouse facilities or other shortterm debt may not be suitable for refinancing through or sales to future securitization transactions which may require us to seek more costly financing for these assets to liquidate assets or to repurchase these assets    we have entered into repurchase agreements and may in the future enter into other repurchase agreements warehouse facilities or other short term debt with similar terms our lenders have the right under our current repurchase agreements and may have the right under such other debt to liquidate assets acquired thereunder upon the occurrence of certain events such as an event of default we are exposed to loss if the proceeds received by the lender upon any such liquidation are insufficient to satisfy our obligation to the lender we are also subject to the risk that the assets subject to such repurchase agreements warehouse facilities or other debt with similar terms might not be suitable for refinancing through or sales to future securitization transactions if we were unable to refinance these assets through or sell these assets to future securitization transactions we might be required to seek more costly financing for these assets to liquidate assets or to repurchase assets under time constraints that may not produce the optimal return to us   our use of repurchase and warehouse facilities and other financing arrangements is subject to the preapproval of the lender which we may be unable to obtain   in order to borrow funds under a repurchase or warehouse agreement or other financing arrangement the lender has the right to review the potential assets for which we are seeking financing and approve such asset in its sole discretion accordingly we may be unable to obtain the consent of a lender to finance an investment and alternate sources of financing for such asset may not exist   our use of repurchase agreements to finance our securities andor loans may give our lenders greater rights in the event that either we or a lender files for bankruptcy including the right to repudiate our repurchase agreements which could limit or delay our claims   in the event of our insolvency or bankruptcy certain repurchase agreements may qualify for special treatment under the us bankruptcy code the effect of which among other things would be to allow the lender under the applicable repurchase agreement to avoid the automatic stay provisions of the us bankruptcy code and to foreclose on the collateral agreement without delay in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of a lender during the term of a repurchase agreement the lender may be permitted under applicable insolvency laws to repudiate the contract and our claim against the lender for damages may be treated simply as an unsecured claim in addition if the lender is a broker or dealer subject to the securities investor protection act of  or an insured depository institution subject to the federal deposit insurance act our ability to exercise our rights to recover our collateral under a repurchase agreement or to be compensated for any damages resulting from the lender’s insolvency may be further limited by those statutes these claims would be subject to significant delay and if and when received may be substantially less than the damages we  actually incur therefore our use of repurchase agreements to finance our portfolio assets exposes our pledged assets to risk in the event of a bankruptcy filing by either a lender or ourselves   if a counterparty to our repurchase transactions defaults on its obligation to resell the underlying security andor loans to us at the end of the transaction term or if the value of the underlying security andor loans has declined as of the end of that term or if we default on our obligations under the repurchase agreement we will lose money on our repurchase transactions   when we engage in repurchase transactions we generally sell securities andor loans to lenders ie repurchase agreement counterparties in return for cash from the lenders the lenders then are obligated to resell the same securities andor loans to us at the end of the term of the transaction in a repurchase agreement the cash we receive from a lender when we initially sell the securities andor loans to such lender is less than the value of the securities andor loans sold if the lender defaults on its obligation to resell the same securities andor loans to us under the terms of a repurchase agreement we will incur a loss on the transaction equal to the difference between the value of the securities andor loans sold and the cash we received from the lender assuming there was no change in the value of the securities andor loans we also would lose money on a repurchase transaction if the value of the underlying securities andor loans has declined as of the end of the transaction term as we would have to repurchase the securities andor loans for their initial value but would receive securities andor loans worth less than that amount further if we default on one of our obligations under a repurchase transaction the lender will be able to terminate the transaction and cease entering into any other repurchase transactions with us our repurchase agreements generally contain crossdefault provisions so that if a default occurs under any one agreement the lenders under our other agreements also could declare a default if a default occurs under any of our repurchase agreements and the lenders terminate one or more of their repurchase agreements we may need to enter into replacement repurchase agreements with different lenders there can be no assurance that we will be successful in entering into such replacement repurchase agreements on the same terms as the repurchase agreements that were terminated or at all any losses that we incur on our repurchase transactions could adversely affect our earnings   we may be subject to repurchases of loans or indemnification on loans and real estate that we have sold if certain representations or warranties in those sales are breached   if loans that we sell or securitize do not comply with representations and warranties that we make about the loans the borrowers or the underlying properties we may be required to repurchase such loans including from a trust vehicle used to facilitate a structured financing of the assets through a securitization or replace them with substitute loans additionally in the case of loans and real estate that we have sold we may be required to indemnify persons for losses or expenses incurred as a result of a breach of a representation or warranty repurchased loans typically will require a significant allocation of working capital to be carried on our books and our ability to borrow against such assets may be limited or unavailable any significant repurchases or indemnification payments could adversely affect our business   representations and warranties made by us in connection with loan sales to securitization vehicles may subject us to liability that could result in loan losses and could harm our operating results and therefore distributions we make to our shareholders   in connection with loan sales to securitization vehicles we are required to make representations and warranties regarding among other things the borrowers guarantors collateral originators and servicers of the loans sold to the depositor of such assets into securitization trusts in the event of a breach of such representations or warranties we may be required to repurchase the affected loans at their face value or otherwise make payments to the owner of the loan while we may have recourse to loan originators if not us borrowers guarantors andor other third parties whose representations warranties certifications reports andor other statements or work product we relied upon in making our representations and warranties there can be no guaranty that such parties will be able to fully or partially cover any liability we may have in such circumstances furthermore if we discover prior to the securitization of an asset that there is any fraud or misrepresentation with respect to the origination of such asset by a third party and are unable to force that third party to repurchase the loan then we may not be able to sell the loan to a securitization or we may have to sell it at a discount in any such case we may incur losses and our cash flows may be impaired   our participation in the market for nonrecourse longterm securitizations may expose us to risks that could result in losses   following the dislocation of credit markets that commenced in  the market for nonrecourse longterm securitizations has resumed and we have generally participated in that market by contributing loans to securitizations led by various large financial institutions and by leading securitizations on mortgage loans we originated and participation interests therein we may in the future take a larger role in leading securitizations of mortgage loans to date when we have acted as a mortgage loan seller into and as an issuer sponsor andor depositor of securitizations we have been obligated to assume substantially similar liabilities as were required of a mortgage loan seller prior to the credit market dislocation including with respect to representations and warranties required to be made for the benefit of investors in particular in connection with any particular securitization we i make certain representations and warranties regarding ourselves and the characteristics of and origination process for the mortgage loans that we contribute to the securitization ii undertake to cure or to repurchase or replace any mortgage loan that we contribute to the securitization that is  affected by a material breach of any such representation and warranty or a material loan document deficiency and iii assume either directly or through the indemnification of thirdparties potential securities law liabilities for disclosure to investors regarding ourselves and the mortgage loans that we contribute to the securitization when we lead securitizations as issuer we assume either directly or through indemnification agreements additional potential securities law liabilities and thirdparty liabilities beyond the liabilities we would assume when we act only as a mortgage loan seller into a securitization   as a result of the dislocation of the credit markets the securitization industry has become subject to additional and changing regulation for example pursuant to the doddfrank act various federal agencies have promulgated or are in the process of promulgating regulations and rules with respect to various issues that affect securitizations including i a rule requiring that sponsors in securitizations retain  of the credit risk associated with securities they issue ii requirements for additional disclosure iii requirements for additional review and reporting including revisions to regulation ab and iv restrictions designed to prohibit conflicts of interest the risk retention rule as it relates to cmbs became effective in december  and requires retention of at least  of the fair value of all securities issued in connection with a securitization for a certain period of time and can be satisfied by i retention of a horizontal tranche ie in one or more subordinate classes ii retention of a vertical security or interest in each class of securities issued in connection with the securitization or iii a combination of vertical and horizontal strips the risk with respect to cmbs must be retained by the sponsor certain mortgage loan originators or upon satisfaction of certain requirements up to two thirdparty purchasers of interests in the securitization other regulations have been and may ultimately be adopted the risk retention rules and other rules and regulations that have been adopted or may be adopted will alter the structure of securitizations in the future and could pose additional risks to or reduce or eliminate the economic benefits of our participation in future securitizations in addition such rules and regulations could reduce or eliminate the economic benefits of securitization or discourage traditional issuers underwriters subordinated security investors or other participants from participating in future securitizations and affect the availability of securitization platforms into which we can contribute mortgage loans which may require that we take on additional roles and risks in connection with effectuating securitizations of mortgage loans   prior to any securitization we generally finance mortgage loans with relatively shortterm facilities until a sufficient portfolio is accumulated we are subject to the risk that we will not be able to originate or acquire sufficient eligible assets to maximize the efficiency of a securitization we also bear the risk that we might not be able to obtain new shortterm facilities or would not be able to renew any shortterm facilities after they expire should we need more time to seek and acquire sufficient eligible assets for a securitization our inability to refinance any shortterm facilities would also increase our risk because borrowings thereunder would likely be recourse to us or one of our subsidiaries if we are unable to obtain and renew shortterm facilities or to consummate securitizations to finance our assets on a longterm basis we may be required to seek other forms of potentially less attractive financing or to liquidate assets at an inopportune time or price   if the interest rates on bonds issued in the market for nonrecourse longterm securitizations that we sell our conduit loans into rise at a disproportionate rate to the interest rates we are able to negotiate on our conduit loans which we refer to as cmbs spreads widening the profitability of our conduit loan business may be adversely affected   we have historically originated conduit loans primarily to sell them into the market for nonrecourse longterm securitizations if cmbs spreads widen we may not be able to sell conduit loans we have originated if the interest rates on such loans are too low to make them attractive assets for purchase by such securitizations or we may be forced to sell conduit loans at a loss in addition our ability to originate conduit loans may be adversely affected to the degree we are unable to negotiate higher interest rates on our conduit loans that would reduce cmbs spread widening any alternative means we develop to finance conduit loans may increase financing costs from historical levels cmbs spreads have recently been and may continue to be volatile  as a result our ability to originate conduit loans the prices securitizations pay for our conduit loans and the profitability of our conduit lending business has decreased and may continue to decrease which has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our performance   our access to the cmbs securitization market and the timing of our securitization activities and other factors may greatly affect our quarterly financial results   we expect to distribute the conduit loans we originate through securitizations and upon completion of a securitization we will recognize certain noninterest revenues which are included in fee and other income on our consolidated statements of income and cease to earn net interest income on the securitized loans our quarterly revenue operating results and profitability have varied substantially from quarter to quarter based on the frequency volume and timing of our securitizations our securitization activities will be affected by a number of factors including our loan origination volumes changes in loan values quality and performance during the period such loans are on our books and conditions in the securitization and credit markets generally and at the time we seek to launch and complete our securitizations as a result of these quarterly variations quartertoquarter comparisons of our operating results may not provide an accurate comparison of our current period results of operations if securities analysts or investors focus on such comparative quartertoquarter performance our stock price performance may be more volatile than if such persons compared a wider period of results of operations    if rait i and rait ii were to fail to meet their performance tests including overcollateralization requirements our cash flow would be materially reduced   the terms of rait i and rait ii generally provide that the principal amount of assets must exceed the principal balance of the related securities issued by them by a certain amount commonly referred to as “overcollateralization” these terms provide that if delinquencies andor losses exceed specified levels based on the analysis by the rating agencies or any financial guaranty insurer of the characteristics of the assets collateralizing the securities issued in the securitization the required level of overcollateralization may be increased or may be prevented from decreasing as would otherwise be permitted if losses or delinquencies did not exceed those levels in addition a failure by these securitizations to satisfy an overcollateralization test may result in accelerated distributions to the holders of the senior debt securities issued by them our equity holdings any debt interests and our subordinated management fees if any are subordinate in right of payment to the other classes of debt securities issued by the securitization entity other tests based on delinquency levels or other criteria may restrict our ability to receive cash distributions from assets collateralizing the securities issued by the securitization entity or our ability to effectively manage the assets held in the securitizations we cannot assure you that any performance test will be satisfied   we currently receive a substantial portion of our cash flow from rait i and rait ii through our retained interests in these securitizations and management fees paid to us for managing these securitizations if either or both of these securitizations were to fail to meet their respective overcollateralization or other tests our cash flow would be materially reduced   rait i and rait ii are required to hold auctions of their collateral assets at specified times and under specified conditions and our liquidity financial performance and our return on the equity we hold in rait i and rait ii may be adversely affected if the proceeds of any auction sales are lower than our valuation of such assets or if we acquire such assets in such auctions on more costly terms than the terms of rait i and rait ii   under the indentures for the notes or the cdo notes issued to unaffiliated investors by rait i and rait ii since the cdo notes were not redeemed in full prior to the distribution date occurring in november  in the case of rait i and if the cdo notes have not been redeemed in full prior to the distribution date occurring in june  in the case of rait ii then an auction of the collateral assets of rait i or rait ii as relevant will be conducted by the relevant trustee and if certain conditions set forth in the relevant indenture are satisfied such collateral assets will be sold at the auction and the relevant cdo notes will be redeemed in whole but not in part on such distribution date no redemption of the cdo notes may occur unless proceeds of the auction together with other defined available redemption funds are sufficient to pay the defined total senior redemption amount if such conditions are not satisfied and the auction is not successfully conducted on such distribution date the relevant trustee will conduct auctions on a periodic basis until the relevant cdo notes are redeemed in full our liquidity and financial performance may be adversely affected if the proceeds of any auction sales are lower than our valuation of such assets or if we acquire such assets in such auctions on more costly terms than the terms of rait i and rait ii in addition our returns on the preference shares and our other equity we hold in rait i and rait ii may be reduced if auctions are held when the total senior redemption amount does not include the payment of an internal rate of return on such preference shares we refer to the auctions contemplated by such indentures as the auction process   risks related to our asset management business   we receive collateral management fees pursuant to collateral management agreements for services we provide as the collateral manager of rait i and rait ii if a collateral management agreement is terminated or if the securities serving as collateral for a securitization are prepaid or go into default the collateral management fees will be reduced or eliminated   we receive collateral management fees pursuant to collateral management agreements for acting as the collateral manager of rait i and rait ii if all the notes issued by one of those securitizations are redeemed or if the collateral management agreement is otherwise terminated we will no longer receive collateral management fees from that securitization in general a collateral management agreement may be terminated both with and without cause at the direction of holders of a specified supermajority in principal amount of the notes issued by the securitization furthermore such fees are based on the total amount of collateral held by the securitizations if the assets serving as collateral for a securitization are prepaid or go into default we will receive lower collateral management fees than expected or the collateral management fees may be eliminated   in addition collateral management agreements typically provide that if certain overcollateralization tests are failed the collateral management agreement may be terminated by a vote of the security holders resulting in our loss of management fees from these securitizations   if any of our securitizations fail to meet overcollateralization tests relevant to the securitization’s most senior existing debt an event of default may occur upon an event of default our ability to manage the securitization may be terminated and our ability to attempt to cure any defaults in the securitization would be limited which would increase the likelihood of a reduction or elimination of cash flow and returns to us in those securitizations for an indefinite time    we expect repayments of loans collateralizing rait i and rait ii outside their contractual maturities to continue to increase in  through  which we expect will reduce our returns from these securitizations    we expect repayment of the loans collateralizing rait i and rait ii outside their contractual maturities to continue to increase in  through  we expect this will reduce our returns from these securitizations and we are evaluating alternative strategies seeking to replace these returns if we are unable to replace these returns our financial performance may be adversely affected we expect to undertake similar analysis for any securitization we sponsor as the notes issued by such securitization approach their respective weighted average lives   we receive servicing and special servicing fees pursuant to servicing agreements with the consolidated securitizations we sponsor collateralized primarily by bridge loans or the fl securitizations for services we provide as the servicer and special servicer and expect to enter into similar agreements in the future with respect to future similar securitizations  if these or any similar servicing agreements are terminated if the loans serving as collateral for a securitization are prepaid or go into default or if the notes issued by these securitizations are repaid or redeemed the servicing fees will be reduced or eliminated   we receive servicing fees pursuant to servicing agreements for acting as the servicer and special servicer of each of the fl securitizations if all the notes issued by any of the fl securitizations are repaid or redeemed or if a servicing agreement is otherwise terminated we will no longer receive servicing fees from the affected fl securitization in general these servicing agreements may be terminated upon the occurrence of a termination event which includes our failure to remit required payments make required advances material breaches of covenants or representations defined bankruptcy and insolvency events and a ratings downgrade citing servicing concerns as a material factor furthermore the fees payable by each securitization are based on the total amount of collateral held by the securitization if the assets serving as collateral for a securitization are prepaid or go into default we will receive lower servicing fees than expected or the servicing fees may be eliminated we may enter into additional similar servicing agreements in the future in connection with future securitizations   if we lose our rating as a commercial mortgage loan primary servicer and special servicer by standard  poor’s and by morningstar our fee income might be reduced   we are rated as a commercial mortgage loan primary servicer and special servicer by standard  poor’s and by morningstar if we were to lose either of these ratings we might need to incur additional expenses in order to regain our rating or obtain comparable credentials from other persons to continue to provide servicing services generating fee income under our arrangements with securitizations or enter into subservicing or other arrangements with third parties in order to continue to earn such fees such expenses or arrangements might reduce our fee income   risks relating to financial reporting requirements and fair value determinations   if we deconsolidate any of rait i rait ii or the fl securitizations it may have a material effect on our financial statements   our consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and the accounts of our subsidiaries and other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest if we were to determine that our interests in any of these entities no longer made us have a controlling financial interest our determination to consolidate such entities would change if we deconsolidate any of these entities for these or any other reasons the assets liabilities equity and income in our financial statements may be changed significantly   if we fail to maintain an effective system of integrated internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and may be required to incur substantial costs and divert management resources   we depend on our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements in order to run our business if we fail to do so our business could be negatively affected and our independent registered public accounting firm may be unable to attest to the accuracy of our financial statements a deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis a significant deficiency is defined as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of a registrant’s financial reporting a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis   although we continuously monitor the design implementation and operating effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures there can be no assurance that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses will  not occur in the future if we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures in the future it could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements that may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis which could cause stakeholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information our inability to remedy any additional deficiencies or material weaknesses that may be identified in the future could among other things cause us to fail to file timely our periodic reports with the sec which may limit our ability to access the capital markets prevent us from providing reliable and accurate financial information and forecasts or from avoiding or detecting fraud or require us to incur additional costs or divert management resources to achieve compliance   our financial statements may be materially impacted if our estimates including loan loss reserves prove to be inaccurate   financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or gaap require the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts different estimates judgments and assumptions reasonably could be used that would have a material effect on the financial statements and changes in these estimates judgments and assumptions are likely to occur from period to period in the future significant areas of accounting requiring the application of management’s judgment include but are not limited to i assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses ii determining the fair value of financial instruments iii assessing other than temporary impairments on securities and iv assessing impairments on real estate held for use or held for sale as these estimates judgments and assumptions are inherently uncertain especially in turbulent economic times our actual financial results may differ from these estimates   accounting standards for certain of our transactions are highly complex and involve significant judgment and assumptions changes in accounting interpretations or assumptions could impact our consolidated financial statements   accounting standards for transfers of financial assets securitization transactions consolidation of variable interest entities or vies convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash and other aspects of our anticipated operations are highly complex and involve significant judgment and assumptions these complexities could lead to a delay in preparation of financial information and the delivery of this information to our shareholders changes in accounting interpretations or assumptions could impact our consolidated financial statements result in a need to restate our financial results and affect our ability to timely prepare our consolidated financial statements our inability to timely prepare our consolidated financial statements in the future would likely adversely affect the trading prices of our common shares or other securities significantly   a portion of our assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value using unobservable inputs and as a result there may be uncertainty as to the value of these investments   we reflect certain derivative instruments and other assets and liabilities at fair value in our balance sheet with all changes in fair value recorded in earnings most of these investments are securities or other assets that are not publicly traded the fair value of securities and other investments that are not publicly traded may not be readily determinable for further discussion of the fair value of our financial instruments see part ii item  “financial statements and supplementary data—note  summary of significant accounting policies—fair value of financial investments” we value these investments quarterly at fair value because such valuations are inherently uncertain may fluctuate over short periods of time and are based on assumptions and estimates our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these investments existed if our determinations regarding the fair value of these investments are not realized we could record a loss upon their disposal   when we acquire properties through the foreclosure of commercial real estate loans we may realize losses if the fair value of the property internally determined upon such acquisition is less than the previous recorded investment of the foreclosed loan   we periodically acquire properties through the foreclosure of commercial real estate loans upon acquisition we value the property and its related assets and liabilities we determine the fair values based primarily upon discounted cash flow or capitalization rate models the use of which requires critical assumptions including discount rates capitalization rates vacancy rates and growth rates based in part on the properties’ operating history and thirdparty data we may realize losses if the fair value of the property internally determined upon acquisition is less than the previous carrying amount of the foreclosed loan    changes in interest rates and changes in interest rate spreads may reduce the value of our investments and reduce our interest income   changes in interest rates and changes in interest rate spreads affect the market value of our investment portfolio in general the market value of a loan will change in inverse relation to an interest rate change where a loan has a fixed interest rate or only limited interest rate adjustments accordingly in a period of rising interest rates the market value of such a loan will decrease moreover in a period of declining interest rates real estate loans with rates that are fixed or variable only to a limited extent may have less value than other incomeproducing securities due to possible prepayments interest rate changes will also affect the return we obtain on new loans in particular during a period of declining rates our reinvestment of loan repayments may be at lower rates than we obtained in prior investments or on the repaid loans also increases in interest rates on debt we incur may not be reflected in increased rates of return on the investments funded through such debt which would reduce our return on those investments accordingly interest rate changes may materially affect the total return on our investment portfolio which in turn will affect the amount available for distribution to shareholders to the extent the spread in interest rates between loans in our portfolio and our underlying sources of capital decreases the value of our loans and interest income may be adversely affected   the value of our investments depends on conditions beyond our control   our investments include loans secured directly or indirectly by real estate interests in entities whose principal or sole assets are real estate or direct ownership of real estate as a result the value of these investments depends primarily upon the value of the real estate underlying these investments which is affected by numerous factors beyond our control including general and local economic conditions neighborhood values competitive overbuilding weather casualty losses occupancy rates and other factors beyond our control the value of this underlying real estate may also be affected by factors such as the costs of compliance with use occupancy and similar regulations potential or actual liabilities under applicable environmental laws changes in interest rates and the availability of financing income from a property will be reduced if a significant number of tenants are unable to pay rent or if available space cannot be rented on favorable terms operating and other expenses of this underlying real estate particularly significant expenses such as mortgage payments insurance real estate taxes and maintenance costs generally do not decrease when income decreases and even if revenue increases operating and other expenses may increase faster than revenues   any investment may also be affected by a borrower’s failure to comply with the terms of our investment its bankruptcy insolvency or reorganization or its properties becoming subject to foreclosure proceedings all of which may require us to become involved in expensive and timeconsuming litigation some of our investments defer some portion of our return to loan maturity or the mandatory redemption date the borrower’s ability to satisfy these deferred obligations may depend upon its ability to obtain suitable refinancing or to otherwise raise a substantial amount of cash these risks may be subject to the same considerations we describe in this “risks relating to our commercial real estate or cre real estate lending business” section   risks related to our investments   we have a concentration of investments in the commercial real estate sector and may have concentrations from time to time in certain property types locations tenants and borrowers which may increase our exposure to the risks of certain economic downturns   we operate in the commercial real estate sector including the financing and ownership of multifamily and other properties such concentration in one economic sector may increase the volatility of our returns and may also expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our portfolio also included other sectors of the economy declining real estate values may reduce the level of new mortgage and other real estaterelated loan originations since borrowers often use appreciation in the value of their existing properties to support the purchase of or investment in additional properties borrowers may also be less able to pay principal and interest on our loans or refinance our loans if the value of real estate weakens further declining real estate values significantly increase the likelihood that we will incur losses on our loans in the event of default because the value of our collateral may be insufficient to cover our recorded investment in the loan any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies foreclosures or losses could adversely affect both our net interest income from loans in our portfolio as well as our ability to originateacquiresell loans which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition liquidity and business   in addition we are not required to observe specific diversification criteria relating to property types locations tenants or borrowers a limited degree of diversification increases risk because the aggregate return of our business may be adversely affected by the unfavorable performance of a single property type single tenant single market or even a single investment to the extent that our portfolio is concentrated in any one region or type of asset downturns relating generally to such region or type of asset may result in defaults on a number of our assets within a short time period additionally borrower concentration in which a particular borrower is or a group of related borrowers are associated with multiple real properties securing mortgage loans or securities held by us magnifies the risks presented by the possible poor performance of such borrowers    we may have material geographic concentrations related to our investments in commercial real estate loans and properties the reits and real estate operating companies in whose securities we invest in may also have material geographic concentrations related to their investments in real estate loans secured by real estate or other investments we also have material concentrations in the property types that comprise our commercial loan portfolio and in the industry sectors that comprise our unsecured securities portfolio we also may have material concentrations in the sponsors of properties that comprise our commercial loan portfolio where we have any kind of concentration risk in our investments an adverse development in that area of concentration could reduce the value of our investment and our return on that investment and if the concentration affects a material amount of our investments impair our ability to execute our investment strategies successfully reduce our earnings and reduce our ability to make distributions   our due diligence efforts before making an investment may not identify all the risks related to that investment   before originating a loan or investment for or making a loan to or investment in an entity we will assess the strength and skills of the entity’s management and other factors that we believe will determine the success of the loan or investment in making the assessment and otherwise conducting customary due diligence we expect to rely on available resources and in some cases an investigation by third parties this process is particularly important and subjective with respect to newly organized entities because there may be little or no information publicly available about the entities as a result there can be no assurance that the due diligence processes we conduct will uncover all relevant facts or that any investment will be successful   our investments are relatively illiquid which may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need arises and any sales may be at a loss to us   our commercial real estate loans and our investments in real estate are relatively illiquid investments and we may be unable to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic financial and investment conditions or dispose of these assets quickly or at all in the event we need additional liquidity a portion of these investments may be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or will otherwise be less liquid than publicly traded securities the illiquidity of these investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need arises and may impair the value of these investments any sales of investments we make may result in our recognizing a loss on the sale   our investments in securitizations are exposed to greater uncertainty and risk of loss than investments in higher grade securities in these securitizations   when we securitize assets such as commercial mortgage loans and mezzanine loans the various tranches of investment grade and noninvestment grade debt obligations and equity securities have differing priorities and rights to the cash flows of the underlying assets being securitized we structured our securitization transactions to enable us to place debt and equity securities with investors in the capital markets at various pricing levels based on the credit position created for each tranche of debt and equity securities the higher rated debt tranches have priority over the lower rated debt securities and the equity securities issued by the particular securitization entity with respect to payments of interest and principal using the cash flows from the collateral assets the relative cost of capital increases as each tranche of capital becomes further subordinated as does the associated risk of loss if cash flows from the assets are insufficient to repay fully interest and principal or pay dividends   since in many cases we own the noninvestment grade and unrated debt and equity classes of securitizations we are in a subordinated andor “first loss” position because the rights of the securities that we hold are subordinate in right of payment and in liquidation to the rights of higher rated debt securities issued by the securitization entities accordingly we have incurred and may in the future incur significant losses when investing in these securities in the event of default we may not be able to recover any or all of our respective investments in these securities in addition we may experience significant losses if the underlying portfolio has been overvalued or if the values subsequently decline and as a result less collateral is available to satisfy interest principal and dividend payments due on the related securities the prices of lower credit quality securities are generally less sensitive to interest rate changes than higher rated investments but are more sensitive to economic downturns or developments specific to a particular issuer current credit market conditions have caused a decline in the price of lower credit quality securities because the ability of obligors on the underlying assets to make principal interest and dividend payments may be impaired in addition existing credit support in a number of the securitizations in which we have invested have been and may in the future be insufficient to protect us against loss of our investments in these securities    risks relating to our commercial real estate or cre real estate lending business   the commercial mortgage loans in which we invest and the commercial mortgage loans underlying the cmbs in which we invest are subject to delinquency foreclosure and loss which could result in losses to us that may result in reduced earnings or losses and reduce our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders   we hold substantial portfolios of commercial mortgage loans and cmbs which are secured by apartment or other commercial property and are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure the ability of a borrower to repay a nonrecourse loan secured by an incomeproducing property typically depends primarily upon the successful operation of such property rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower if the net operating income of the property is reduced the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired net operating income of an incomeproducing property can be affected by among other things tenant mix success of tenant businesses property management decisions property location and condition competition from comparable types of properties changes in laws that increase operating expense or limit rents that may be charged any need to address environmental contamination at the property the occurrence of any uninsured casualty at the property changes in national regional or local economic conditions andor specific industry segments declines in regional or local real estate values declines in regional or local rental or occupancy rates increases in interest rates real estate tax rates and other operating expenses changes in governmental rules regulations and fiscal policies including environmental legislation acts of god terrorism social unrest and civil disturbances   in the event of any default under a commercial mortgage loan held directly by us we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the principal and accrued interest of the mortgage loan which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations in the event of the bankruptcy of a commercial mortgage loan borrower the mortgage loan to such borrower will be deemed to be secured only to the extent of the value of the underlying collateral at the time of bankruptcy as determined by the bankruptcy court and the lien securing the mortgage loan will be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtorinpossession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state law   foreclosure of a commercial mortgage loan can be an expensive and lengthy process which could have a substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on the foreclosed mortgage loan cmbs evidence interests in or are secured by a single commercial mortgage loan or a pool of commercial mortgage loans accordingly the mortgagebacked securities in which we invest are subject to all of the risks of the underlying mortgage loans   our reserves for loan losses may prove inadequate which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results   we maintain loan loss reserves to protect against probable incurred losses and conduct a review of the appropriateness of these reserves on a quarterly basis our loan loss reserves reflect management’s thencurrent estimation of the probability and severity of losses within our portfolio based on this quarterly review our determination of loan loss reserves relies on significant estimates regarding the fair value of loan collateral the estimation of these fair values is a complex and subjective process as such there can be no assurance that management’s judgment will prove to be correct and that reserves will be adequate over time to protect against future losses such losses could be caused by factors including but not limited to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or events adversely affecting specific assets borrowers industries in which our borrowers operate markets in which our borrowers or their properties are located or an inability to collect accrued interest receivable on loans which accrue interest at a higher rate than their stated pay rate if our reserves for loan losses prove inadequate we will suffer additional losses which may have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations   prepayment rates on mortgage loans cannot be predicted with certainty and prepayments may result in losses to the value of our assets   the frequency at which prepayments including voluntary prepayments by the borrowers and liquidations due to defaults and foreclosures occur on our investments can adversely impact our business prepayment rates cannot be predicted with certainty making it impossible to completely insulate us from prepayment or other such risks prepayments of our investments in loans may adversely impact our portfolio because investments may experience outright losses in an environment of faster actual or anticipated prepayments or may underperform relative to hedges that the management team may have constructed for such investments resulting in a loss to our overall portfolio additionally borrowers are more likely to prepay when the prevailing level of interest rates falls thereby exposing us to the risk that the prepayment proceeds may be reinvested only at a lower interest rate than that borne by the prepaid obligation      our subordinated real estate investments such as mezzanine loans and preferred equity interests in entities owning real estate involve increased risk of loss   we invest in mezzanine loans and other forms of subordinated financing such as investments consisting of preferred equity interests in entities owning real estate because of their subordinate position these subordinated investments carry a greater credit risk than senior lien financing including a substantially greater risk of nonpayment if a borrower defaults on our subordinated investment or on debt senior to us our subordinated investment will be satisfied only after the senior debt is paid off which may result in our being unable to recover the full amount or any of our investment a decline in the real estate market could reduce the value of the property so that the aggregate outstanding balances of senior liens may exceed the value of the underlying property   where debt senior to our investment exists the presence of intercreditor arrangements may limit our ability to amend our loan documents assign our loans accept prepayments exercise our remedies through “standstill” periods and control decisions made in bankruptcy proceedings relating to borrowers bankruptcy and borrower litigation can significantly increase the time needed for us to acquire the underlying collateral in the event of a default during which time the collateral may decline in value in addition there are significant costs and delays associated with the foreclosure process in the event of a default on a senior loan we may elect to make payments if we have the right to do so in order to prevent foreclosure on the senior loans when we originate or acquire a subordinated investment we typically do not have the right to service senior loans the servicers of the senior loans are responsible to the holders of those loans whose interests will likely not coincide with ours particularly in the event of a default accordingly the senior loans may not be serviced in a manner advantageous to us it is also possible that in some cases a “due on sale” clause included in a senior mortgage which accelerates the amount due under the senior mortgage in case of the sale of the property may apply to the sale of the property if we foreclose increasing our risk of loss   our investments in subordinate loans subordinate participation interests in loans and subordinate cmbs rank junior to other senior debt and we may be unable to recover our investment in these loans   we may originate or acquire subordinate loans including mezzanine loans subordinate participation interests in loans and subordinate cmbs in the event a borrower defaults on a loan and lacks sufficient assets to satisfy our loan we may suffer a loss of principal or interest in the event a borrower declares bankruptcy we may not have full recourse to the assets of the borrower or the assets of the borrower may not be sufficient to satisfy the loan in addition certain of our loans may be subordinate to other debt of the borrower if a borrower defaults on a loan to us or on debt senior to our loan or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy our loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt is paid in full where debt senior to our loan exists the presence of intercreditor arrangements may limit our ability to amend loan documents assign our loans accept prepayments exercise remedies and control decisions made in bankruptcy proceedings relating to borrowers   in general losses on a property securing a mortgage loan included in a securitization will be borne first by the equity holder of the property then by a cash reserve fund or letter of credit if any then by the holder of a mezzanine loan or bnote if any then by the “first loss” subordinated security holder generally the “bpiece” buyer and then by the holder of a higherrated security in the event of default and the exhaustion of any equity support reserve fund letter of credit mezzanine loans or bnotes and any classes of securities junior to those in which we may invest we may not be able to recover all of our investment in the securities we purchased in addition if the underlying mortgage portfolio has been overvalued by the originator or if the values subsequently decline and as a result less collateral is available to satisfy interest and principal payments due on the related mortgagebacked securities the securities in which we may invest may effectively become the “first loss” position behind the more senior securities which may result in significant losses to us the prices of lower credit quality securities are generally less sensitive to interest rate changes than more highly rated investments but more sensitive to adverse economic downturns or individual issuer developments a projection of an economic downturn for example could cause a decline in the price of lower credit quality securities because the ability of obligors of mortgage loans underlying the mortgagebacked securities to make principal and interest payments may be impaired in such event existing credit support in the securitization structure may be insufficient to protect us against loss of our principal in these securities   we may make equity and preferred equity investments which involve a greater risk of loss than traditional debt financing   we may invest in equity and preferred equity interests in entities owning real estate such investments are subordinate to debt financing and are not secured should the issuer default on our investment in most instances we would only be able to proceed against the entity that issued the equity in accordance with the terms of the security and not any property owned by the entity furthermore in the event of bankruptcy or foreclosure we would only be able to recoup our capital after any creditors to the entity are paid as a result we may not recover some or all of our capital which could result in losses    the vast majority of the mortgage loans that we originate or purchase and those underlying the cmbs in which we invest are nonrecourse loans and the assets securing the loans may not be sufficient to protect us from a partial or complete loss if the borrower defaults on the loan   except for customary nonrecourse carveouts for certain actions and environmental liability most commercial mortgage loans including those underlying the cmbs in which we invest are effectively nonrecourse obligations of the sponsor and borrower meaning that there is no recourse against the assets of the borrower or sponsor other than the underlying collateral in the event of any default under a mortgage loan held directly by us we will bear a risk of loss to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the principal and accrued interest of the mortgage loan which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations even if a mortgage loan is recourse to the borrower or if a nonrecourse carveout to the borrower applies in most cases the borrower’s assets are limited primarily to its interest in the related mortgaged property further although a mortgage loan may provide for limited recourse to a principal or affiliate of the related borrower there is no assurance of any recovery from such principal or affiliate will be made or that such principal’s or affiliate’s assets would be sufficient to pay any otherwise recoverable claim   certain balance sheet loans may be more illiquid and involve a greater risk of loss than longterm mortgage loans   we originate and acquire balance sheet loans generally having maturities of three years or less that provide interim financing to borrowers seeking shortterm capital for the acquisition or transition for example lease up andor rehabilitation of commercial real estate such a borrower under an interim loan often has identified a transitional asset that has been undermanaged andor is located in a recovering market if the market in which the asset is located fails to recover according to the borrower’s projections or if the borrower fails to improve the quality of the asset’s management andor the value of the asset the borrower may not receive a sufficient return on the asset to satisfy the interim loan and we bear the risk that we may not recover some or all of our initial expenditure in addition borrowers usually use the proceeds of a longterm mortgage loan to repay an interim loan we may therefore be dependent on a borrower’s ability to obtain permanent financing to repay our interim loan which could depend on market conditions and other factors   further interim loans may be relatively less liquid than loans against stabilized properties due to their short life the more limited availability of financing through securitizations than for conduit loans any unstabilized nature of the underlying real estate and the difficulty of recovery in the event of a borrower’s default this lack of liquidity may significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our interim loan portfolio and may adversely affect the value of the portfolio   such “liquidity risk” may be difficult or impossible to hedge against and may also make it difficult to effect a sale of such assets as we may need or desire as a result if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our interim loan portfolio quickly we may realize significantly less than the value at which such investments were previously recorded which may fail to maximize the value of the investments or result in a loss     we are subject to additional risks associated with loan participations because our ability to exercise our rights may be restricted by the terms of the participation   some of our loans are participation interests or colender arrangements in which we share the rights obligations and benefits of the loan with other lenders we may need the consent of these parties to exercise our rights under such loans including rights with respect to amendment of loan documentation enforcement proceedings in the event of default and the institution of and control over foreclosure proceedings similarly a majority of the participants may be able to take actions to which we object but to which we will be bound if our participation interest represents a minority interest we may be adversely affected by this lack of full control   we may originate or acquire bnotes a form of subordinated mortgage loan and we may be subject to additional risks relating to the negotiated structure and terms of the transaction which may result in losses to us   we may originate or acquire bnotes a bnote is a mortgage loan typically i secured by a first mortgage on a single commercial property or group of related properties and ii subordinated to an anote secured by the same first mortgage on the same collateral as a result if a borrower defaults there may not be sufficient funds remaining for bnote owners after payment to the anote owners   however since each transaction is privately negotiated bnotes can vary in their structural characteristics and risks for example the rights of holders of bnotes to control the process following a borrower default may be limited in certain investments and circumstances further bnotes typically are secured by a single property and so reflect the increased risks associated with a single property compared to a pool of properties bnotes also are less liquid than cmbs thus we may be unable to dispose of underperforming or nonperforming investments    we may not control the special servicing of the mortgage loans or other debt underlying the debt securities in which we invest and in such cases the special servicer may take actions that could adversely affect our interest   in circumstances where we do not maintain a first mortgage position overall control over the special servicing of the mortgage loans or other debt underlying the debt securities in which we invest may be held by a directing certificate holder which is typically appointed by the holders of the most subordinate class of such debt security then outstanding we ordinarily do not have the right to appoint the directing certificate holder in connection with the servicing of the specially serviced loans the related special servicer may at the direction of the directing certificate holder take actions that could adversely affect our interest   risks related to our investments in real estate   reduction in occupancy and rent levels on multifamily properties could adversely affect their value and cash flow   occupancy and rent levels at a multifamily property may be adversely affected by     • local regional or national economic conditions which may limit the amount of rent that can be charged for rental units or result in a reduction in timely rent payments   • construction of additional housing units in the same market   • local military base or industrialbusiness closings   • in the case of student housing facilities the financial wellbeing of andor developments at the college or university to which it relates competition from oncampus housing units the physical layout of the housing and a higher turnover rate than other types of multifamily tenants which in certain cases is compounded by the fact that student leases are available for periods of less than  months   • the tenant mix such as tenants being predominantly students military personnel corporate tenants or employees of a particular business   • national regional and local politics including current or future rent stabilization and rent control laws and agreements   • trends in the senior housing market   • the level of mortgage interest rates which may encourage tenants in multifamily properties to purchase housing and   • a lack of amenities unattractive physical attributes or bad reputation of the mortgaged property   a significant tenant ceasing to operate at a retail property could adversely affect its value and cash flow   the value of retail properties is significantly affected by the quality of the tenants as well as fundamental aspects of real estate such as location and market demographics the correlation between the success of tenant business and a retail property’s value may be more direct with respect to retail properties than other types of commercial property because a component of the total rent paid by certain retail tenants is often tied to a percentage of gross sales   there is no guarantee that any tenant will continue to occupy space in the related retail property the presence of significant tenants or anchor tenants is an important consideration at a retail property a retail “anchor tenant” or “shadowanchor tenant” plays a key role in attracting customers to a retail property and making a retail property a desirable location for other tenants whether or not it is located on the mortgaged property a significant tenant or anchor tenant ceasing to do business at a retail property could result in realized losses on the mortgage loans the loss of a significant tenant or anchor tenants may result from the tenant’s voluntary decision not to renew a lease or to terminate it in accordance with its terms the bankruptcy or economic decline of the tenant the tenant’s general cessation of business activities or other reasons including cotenancy provisions permitting a tenant to terminate a lease prior to its term   some tenants at retail properties may be entitled to terminate their leases or pay reduced rent if sales are below certain target levels or if an anchor tenant or one or more of the larger tenants cease operations at that property or fail to open if anchor stores in a mortgaged property were to close the borrower may be unable to replace those anchor tenants in a timely manner on similar terms and customer traffic may be reduced possibly affecting sales at the remaining retail tenants the lack of replacement anchors and a reduction in rental income from remaining tenants may adversely affect the borrower’s ability to pay current debt service or successfully refinance the mortgage loan at maturity these risks with respect to an anchored retail property may be increased when the property is a single tenant property   in addition various anchor parcels andor anchor improvements at a mortgaged property may be owned by the anchor tenant or an affiliate of the anchor tenant or by a third party rather than the related borrower and therefore not be part of the related mortgaged property and the related borrower may not receive rental income from such anchor tenant    current levels of property income may not be maintained due to varying tenant occupancy   rental payments from tenants of retail properties typically comprise the largest portion of the net operating income of those mortgaged properties tenants at our retail properties may be paying rent but are not yet in occupancy or have signed leases but have not yet started paying rent andor are not yet in occupancy tenants at our retail properties may be in a rent abatement period there can be no assurance that such tenants will be in a position to pay full rent when the abatement period expires risks applicable to anchor tenants such as bankruptcy failure to renew leases early terminations of leases and vacancies also apply to other tenants we cannot assure you that the rate of occupancy at the stores will remain at the current levels or that the net operating income contributed by our retail properties will remain at its current or past levels     competition may adversely affect the value and cash flow from retail properties retail properties face competition from sources outside their local real estate market for example all of the following compete with more traditional retail properties for consumer business     • factory outlet centers   • discount shopping centers and clubs   • video shopping networks   • video stores   • book stores   • catalogue retailers   • home shopping networks   • direct mail   • internet websites and   • telemarketers   continued growth of these alternative retail outlets which often have lower operating costs could adversely affect the rents collectible at our retail properties that operate as retail properties as well as the market value of our retail properties moreover additional competing retail properties have been and may in the future be built in the areas where the retail properties are located such competition could result in a reduction of income from our retail properties   in addition although renovations and expansion at our retail properties will generally enhance the value of those properties over time in the short term construction and renovation work at such properties may negatively impact net operating income as customers may be deterred from shopping at or near a construction site   economic decline in tenant businesses or changes in demographic conditions could adversely affect the value and cash flow from office properties    economic decline in the businesses operated by the tenants of office properties may increase the likelihood that the tenants may be unable to pay their rent which could result in realized losses on the mortgage loans a number of economic and demographic factors may adversely affect the value of office properties including     • the quality and diversity of an office building’s tenants or reliance on a single or dominant tenant   • the quality of property management   • provisions in tenant leases that may include early termination provisions   • an economic decline in the business operated by the tenants   • the physical attributes of the building in relation to competing buildings eg age condition design location access to transportation and ability to offer certain amenities including without limitation current business wiring requirements   • the desirability of the area as a business location   • the strength and nature of the local economy including labor costs and quality tax environment and quality of life for employees   • an adverse change in population patterns of telecommuting or sharing of office space and employment growth which creates demand for office space   • competition from other office properties in the same market could decrease occupancy or rental rates at office properties and   • decreased occupancy or rental revenues could adversely affect property cash flow   moreover the cost of refitting office space for a new tenant is often higher than the cost of refitting other types of property    these risks may be increased if rental revenue depends on a single tenant on a few tenants if the property is owner occupied or if there is a significant concentration of tenants in a particular business or industry in addition adverse developments in the local regional and national economies can affect the ability of a landlord to incur the cost of providing services at an office property and the ability of a landlord to provide services to an office property can have a significant effect on the success of the property further technological developments can affect the viability of office properties by rendering facilities obsolete or by reducing the size of the workforce necessary to perform office tasks thus reducing demand for office space   if one or more of the larger tenants at a particular office property were to close or remain vacant we cannot assure you that such tenants would be replaced in a timely manner or that such replacement tenants would be without incurring material additional costs to the related borrower thus adversely affecting property cash flow   risks particular to industrial properties could adversely affect the value and cash flow from industrial properties    industrial properties may be adversely affected by reduced demand for industrial space occasioned by a decline in a particular industry segment for example a decline in defense spending and a particular industrial property that suited the needs of its original tenant may be difficult to relet to another tenant or may become functionally obsolete relative to newer properties furthermore lease terms with respect to industrial properties are generally for shorter periods of time and may result in a substantial percentage of leases expiring in the same year at any particular industrial property in addition industrial properties are often more prone to environmental concerns due to the nature of items being stored or type of work conducted at the property further industrial properties may have tenants that are subject to risks unique to their business such as cold storage facilities because of seasonal use leases at such facilities are customarily for shorter terms making income potentially more volatile than for properties with longer term leases in addition such facilities require customized refrigeration design rendering them less readily convertible to alternative uses   site characteristics at industrial properties may impose restrictions that may limit the properties’ suitability for tenants and affect the value of the properties site characteristics which affect the value of an industrial property include     • clear ceiling heights   • column spacing   • number of bays loading docks and bay depths   • truck turning radius   • divisibility   • zoning restrictions and   • overall functionality and accessibility   an industrial property also requires availability of labor sources proximity to supply sources and customers and accessibility to rail lines major roadways and other distribution channels   properties used for industrial purposes may be more prone to environmental concerns than other property types increased environmental risks could adversely affect the value and cash flow from industrial properties   risks associated with tenants generally could adversely affect the cash flow from properties   cash flow from our properties will be affected by the expiration of leases and our ability to renew the leases or to relet the space on comparable terms we generally rely on periodic lease or rental payments or guest fees from tenants to pay for maintenance and other operating expenses of the building to fund capital improvements and to service the related obligation and any other debt or obligations it may have outstanding there can be no assurance that tenants will renew leases upon expiration or that if renewed the terms would be similar to or more favorable than the terms of the prior lease or that the tenants will continue operations throughout the term of their leases our properties may have significant portions of monthtomonth tenants or may have leases of short duration such leases do not provide the same stability as longerterm leases cash flow from properties would be adversely affected if tenants were unable to pay rent or if space was unable to be rented on favorable terms or at all changes in payment patterns by tenants may result from a variety of social legal and economic factors including without limitation the rate of inflation and unemployment levels and may be reflected in the rental rates offered for comparable space in addition upon reletting or renewing existing leases we will likely be required to pay leasing commissions and tenant improvement costs which may adversely affect cash flow from the relevant property   we cannot assure you that  leases that expire can be renewed  the space covered by leases that expire or are terminated can be relet in a timely manner at comparable rents or on comparable terms or  we will have the cash or be able to obtain the financing to fund any required tenant improvements further lease provisions among tenants may conflict in certain instances or leases may contain restrictions on the use of parcels near the related property for which there is no corresponding restrictive covenant  of record in each case creating termination or other risks income from and the market value of the relevant properties would be adversely affected if vacant space in such properties could not be leased for a significant period of time if tenants were unable to meet their lease obligations or if for any other reason rental payments could not be collected or if one or more tenants ceased operations at such property upon the occurrence of an event of default by a tenant delays and costs in enforcing the lessor’s rights could occur   if we are not able to relet the expiring or terminated space under as favorable conditions due to a decrease in the market rate for similar space then cash flow from the relevant property may be adversely affected similarly our inability to fully or favorably relet the premises may adversely impact our ability to finance or sell the related property in order to make any required balloon payment   uninsured and underinsured losses may affect the value of or our return from our real estate   our properties and the properties underlying our loans have comprehensive insurance in amounts we believe are sufficient to permit the replacement of the properties in the event of a total loss subject to applicable deductibles there are however certain types of losses such as earthquakes sinkholes floods hurricanes and terrorism that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable also inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors might make it impractical to use insurance proceeds to replace a damaged or destroyed property if any of these or similar events occurs it may reduce our return from an affected property and the value of our investment     real estate with environmental problems may create liabilities and exposure to losses   the existence of hazardous or toxic substances on a property will adversely affect its value and our ability to sell or borrow against the property contamination of real estate by hazardous substances or toxic wastes not only may give rise to a lien on that property to assure payment of the cost of remediation but also can result in liability to us as owner operator or lender for that cost many environmental laws can impose liability whether we know of or are responsible for the contamination in addition if we arrange for the disposal of hazardous or toxic substances at another site we may be liable for the costs of cleaning up and removing those substances from the site even if we neither own nor operate the disposal site environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially limit our use of our properties and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders in addition future or amended laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing environmental requirements may increase our exposure to environmental liability   if we are unable to improve the performance of commercial real estate properties we take control of in connection with restructurings workouts and foreclosures of investments our financial performance may be adversely affected   we have taken control of properties underlying our commercial real estate investments in connection with restructurings workouts and foreclosures of these investments if we are unable to improve the performance of these properties from their performance under their prior owners our cash flow may be adversely affected if the properties’ cash flow is insufficient to support payments due on any related debt and we may not be able to sell these properties at a price that will allow us to recover our investment   we may need to make significant capital improvements to our properties in order to remain competitive   our investments in real estate may face competition from newer more updated properties in order to remain competitive we may need to make significant capital improvements to these properties in addition if we need to release a property we may need to make significant tenant improvements any financing of such improvements may reduce our ability to operate the property profitably and if financing is not available we may use our available cash resources which would reduce our cash flow liquidity and ability to make distributions to shareholders   lease expirations lease defaults and lease terminations may adversely affect our revenue   lease expirations lease defaults and lease terminations may result in reduced revenue from our real estate if the lease payments received from replacement tenants are less than the lease payments received from the expiring defaulting or terminating tenants in addition lease defaults by one or more significant tenants lease terminations by tenants following events causing significant damage to the property or takings by eminent domain or the failure of tenants under expiring leases to elect to renew their leases could cause us to experience long periods with reduced or no revenue from a property and to incur substantial capital expenditures in order to obtain replacement tenants see item — “properties” for a tenyear lease expiration schedule for our nonresidential properties as of december      risks relating to our use of derivatives and hedging instruments   complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively   the reit provisions of the code may limit our ability to hedge our assets and operations under these provisions any income that we generate from transactions intended to hedge our interest rate risk will be excluded from gross income for purposes of the reit  and  gross income tests if the instrument hedges interest rate risk on liabilities used to carry or acquire real estate assets and such instrument is properly identified under applicable treasury regulations income from hedging transactions that do not meet these requirements will generally constitute nonqualifying income for purposes of both the reit  and  gross income tests as a result of these rules we may have to limit our use of hedging techniques that might otherwise be advantageous or implement those hedges through a trs this could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our trss would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear in addition losses in our trss will generally not provide any tax benefit except for being carried forward against future taxable income in the trss   hedging may adversely affect our earnings which could reduce our cash available for distribution to our shareholders   subject to maintaining our qualification as a reit we may pursue various hedging strategies to seek to reduce our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates our hedging activity will vary in scope based on the level and volatility of interest rates the type of assets held compliance with reit rules and other changing market conditions interest rate hedging may fail to protect or could adversely affect us because among other things     • interest rate hedging can be expensive particularly during periods of rising and volatile interest rates   • available interest rate hedges may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought   • due to a credit loss or other factors the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related liability   • applicable law may require mandatory clearing of certain interest rate hedges we may wish to use which may raise costs   • the credit quality of the hedging counterparty owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign its side of the hedging transaction   • the hedging counterparty owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay   • we may fail to recalculate readjust and execute hedges in an efficient manner and   • legal tax and regulatory changes could occur and may adversely affect our ability to pursue our hedging strategies andor increase the costs of implementing such strategies   any hedging activity in which we engage may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows therefore while we may enter into such transactions seeking to reduce risks unanticipated changes in interest rates or credit spreads may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions in addition the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions or liabilities being hedged may vary materially moreover for a variety of reasons we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio positions or liabilities being hedged any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and furthermore may expose us to risk of loss   in addition some hedging instruments involve additional risk because they are not traded on regulated exchanges guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house or regulated by any us or foreign governmental authorities consequently we cannot assure you that a liquid secondary market will exist for hedging instruments purchased or sold and we may be required to maintain a position until exercise or expiration which could result in significant losses in addition regulatory requirements with respect to derivatives including eligibility of counterparties reporting recordkeeping exchange of margin financial responsibility or segregation of customer funds and positions are still under development and could impact our hedging transactions and how we and our counterparty must manage such transactions   we are subject to counterparty risk associated with our hedging activities   we are subject to credit risk with respect to the counterparties to derivative contracts whether a clearing corporation in the case of exchangetraded instruments or another third party in the case of otc instruments if a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations under a derivative contract due to financial difficulties we may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery under the derivative contract in a dissolution assignment for the benefit of creditors liquidation windingup bankruptcy or other analogous proceeding in the event of the insolvency of a counterparty to a derivative transaction the derivative transaction would typically be terminated at its fair market value if we are owed this fair market value in the termination of the derivative transaction and its claim is unsecured we will be treated as a general creditor of such counterparty and will not have  any claim with respect to the underlying security we may obtain only a limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances in addition the business failure of a counterparty with whom we enter into a hedging transaction will most likely result in its default which may result in the loss of potential future value and the loss of our hedge and force us to cover our commitments if any at the then current market price   we may enter into hedging transactions that could expose us to contingent liabilities in the future   subject to maintaining our qualification as a reit part of our investment strategy may involve entering into hedging transactions that could require us to fund cash payments in certain circumstances such as the early termination of the hedging instrument caused by an event of default or other early termination event or the decision by a counterparty to request margin securities it is contractually owed under the terms of the hedging instrument the amount due with respect to an early termination would generally be equal to the unrealized loss of such open transaction positions with the respective counterparty and could also include other fees and charges these economic losses will be reflected in our results of operations and our ability to fund these obligations will depend on the liquidity of our assets and access to capital at the time and the need to fund these obligations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition   we may fail to qualify for or choose not to elect hedge accounting treatment which could adversely affect our operating results   we intend to record derivative and hedging transactions in accordance with topic  of the financial accounting standards board’s accounting standard codification or topic  under these standards we may fail to qualify for or choose not to elect hedge accounting treatment for a number of reasons including if we use instruments that do not meet the topic  definition of a derivative such as short sales we fail to satisfy topic  hedge documentation and hedge effectiveness assessment requirements or our instruments are not highly effective if we fail to qualify for or choose not to elect hedge accounting treatment our operating results may suffer because losses on the derivatives that we enter into may not be offset by a change in the fair value of the related hedged transaction or item   rules under the doddfrank act wall street reform and consumer protection act of  or doddfrank act may require that we post cash collateral to secure our hedging transactions and any posting of such collateral could reduce our liquidity or limit our ability to hedge   the doddfrank act covers certain hedging instruments we may use in our risk management activities the doddfrank act and related sec and us commodity futures trading commission or cftc regulations that have been adopted to date include significant provisions regarding the regulation of derivatives including mandatory clearing and margin requirements mandatory central clearing requires that we post cash collateral to secure our hedging transactions any posting of such collateral could reduce our liquidity or limit our ability to hedge   if we enter into certain hedging transactions or otherwise invest in certain derivative instruments failure to obtain and maintain an exemption from being regulated as a commodity pool operator could subject us to additional regulation and compliance requirements which could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition   rules under the doddfrank act establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for derivative contracts commonly referred to as “swaps” under this regulatory framework mortgage real estate investment trusts or reits that trade in commodity interest positions including swaps are considered “commodity pools” and the operators of such reits would be considered “commodity pool operators” or cpos absent relief a cpo must register with the cftc and become a member of the national futures association or nfa which requires compliance with nfa’s rules and renders such cpo subject to regulation by the cftc including with respect to disclosure reporting recordkeeping and business conduct we may from time to time directly or indirectly invest in instruments that meet the definition of “swap” under the new doddfrank act rules which may subject us to oversight by the cftc   in the event that we invest in commodity interests absent relief we would be required to register as a cpo we believe rait and its affiliates that could be considered cpos have taken and will continue to take all appropriate steps needed to maintain such relief in addition rait and its affiliates may in the future claim a different exemption from registration as a cpo with the cftc therefore unlike a registered cpo we will not be required to provide prospective investors with a cftc compliant disclosure document nor will we be required to provide investors with periodic account statements or certified annual reports that satisfy the requirements of cftc rules applicable to registered cpos in connection with any offerings of shares   as an alternative to an exemption from registration rait or its affiliates may register as a cpo with the cftc and avail itself of certain disclosure reporting and recordkeeping relief under cftc rule     the cftc has substantial enforcement power with respect to violations of the laws over which it has jurisdiction including antifraud and antimanipulation provisions among other things the cftc may suspend or revoke the registration of a person who fails to comply prohibit such a person from trading or doing business with registered entities impose civil money penalties require restitution and seek fines or imprisonment for criminal violations additionally a private right of action exists against those who violate the laws over which the cftc has jurisdiction or who willfully aid abet counsel induce or procure a violation of those laws in the event we fail to receive interpretive relief from the cftc on this matter are unable to claim an exemption from registration and fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of these new rules we may be unable to use certain types of hedging instruments or we may be subject to significant fines penalties and other civil or governmental actions or proceedings any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition   during  interest rate swap agreements relating to rait i and rait ii terminated in accordance with their terms which could expose us to increased interest rate risk   during  interest rate swap agreements relating to rait i and rait ii terminated in accordance with their terms this could expose us to the risk that interest rait i and rait ii pay on their respective cdo notes will be higher than the interest paid on the assets collateralizing the cdo notes     tax risks   we and our reit affiliates may fail to qualify as a reit and such failure to qualify would have significant adverse consequences on the value of our common shares in addition if we fail or any reit affiliate fails to qualify as a reit our respective dividends will not be deductible and the entity will be subject to corporatelevel tax on its net taxable income which would reduce the cash available to make distributions   we believe that we have been organized and operated in a manner that will allow us to qualify as a reit we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the irs that we and our reit affiliates qualify as a reit and any statements in our filings or the filings of our reit affiliates with the sec are not binding on the irs or any court qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may also affect our abilities and those of our reit affiliates to qualify as a reit in order to qualify as a reit we and our reit affiliates must each satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our respective assets and sources of our respective gross income also we must each make distributions to our respective shareholders aggregating annually at least  of our respective net taxable incomes excluding net capital gains in addition our respective ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or limited influence including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership or reit for us federal income tax purposes as an example to the extent we invest in preferred equity securities of other reit issuers our qualification as a reit will depend upon the continued qualification of such issuers as reits under the internal revenue code accordingly unlike other reits we and our reit affiliates may be subject to additional risk regarding our respective ability to qualify and maintain our respective qualification as a reit the reduction in our rate of originating new assets operations and liquidity may adversely impact our and our reit affiliates’ ability to meet reit requirements and we and our reit affiliates may be less able to make changes to our respective investment portfolios to adjust our respective reit qualifying assets and income depending on our respective ability to deploy capital and maintain assets under management   there can be no assurance that we and our reit affiliates will be successful in operating in a manner that will allow us to each qualify as a reit because we receive significant distributions from trft and may in the future receive significant distributions from other of our reit affiliates the failure of one or more of such reit affiliates to maintain its reit status could cause us to lose our reit status in addition legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors our respective ability to qualify as a reit or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments   if we or any of our reit affiliates fail to qualify as a reit or lose our respective qualification as a reit at any time we or such reit affiliate would face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution to our respective shareholders for each of the years involved because     • we or such reit affiliate would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to our respective shareholders in computing taxable income and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates   • we or such reit affiliate also could be subject to the us federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes and   • unless statutory relief provisions apply we or such reit affiliate could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year of disqualification    in addition if we or such reit affiliate fail to qualify as a reit such entity will not be required to make distributions to its shareholders and all distributions to shareholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits     complying with reit requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities   to qualify as a reit we and our reit affiliates must each continually satisfy various tests regarding sources of income nature and diversification of assets amounts distributed to shareholders and the ownership of common shares in order to satisfy these tests we and our reit affiliates may be required to forgo investments that might otherwise be made accordingly compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our and our reit affiliates’ investment performance   in particular at least  of our and our reit affiliates total assets at the end of each calendar quarter must each consist of real estate assets government securities and cash or cash items for this purpose “real estate assets” generally include interests in real property such as land buildings leasehold interests in real property stock of other entities that qualify as reits interests in mortgage loans secured by real property investments in stock or debt instruments during the oneyear period following the receipt of new capital and regular or residual interests in a real estate mortgage investment conduit or remic in addition the amount of securities of a single issuer that we and each of our reit affiliates hold must generally not exceed either  of the value of our gross assets or  of the vote or value of the issuer’s outstanding securities   certain of the assets that we or our reit affiliates hold or intend to hold will not be qualified real estate assets for the purposes of the reit asset tests in addition although preferred equity securities of reits should generally be treated as qualified real estate assets this will require that i they are treated as equity for us tax purposes and ii their issuers maintain their qualification as reits cmbs should generally qualify as real estate assets however to the extent that we or our reit affiliates own nonremic collateralized mortgage obligations or other debt instruments secured by mortgage loans rather than by real property or secured by nonreal estate assets or debt securities issued by corporations that are not secured by mortgages on real property those securities will likely not be qualifying real estate assets for purposes of the reit asset tests   we and our reit affiliates generally will be treated as the owner of any assets that collateralize a securitization transaction to the extent that we or such affiliates retain all of the equity of the securitization entity and do not make an election to treat such securitization entity as a trs as described in further detail below   as noted above in order to comply with the reit asset tests and  gross income test at least  of each of our respective total assets and  of gross income must be derived from qualifying real estate assets whether or not such assets would otherwise represent our respective best investment alternative   a reit’s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a  penalty tax in general prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property other than foreclosure property but including any mortgage loans held in inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business the prohibited transaction tax may apply to any sale of assets to a securitization and to any sale of securitization securities and therefore may limit our respective ability to sell assets to or equity in securitizations and other assets   it may be possible to reduce the impact of the prohibited transaction tax and the holding of assets not qualifying as real estate assets for purposes of the reit asset tests by conducting certain activities holding nonqualifying reit assets or engaging in securitization transactions through our trss subject to certain limitations as described below to the extent that we and our reit affiliates engage in such activities through trss the income associated with such activities may be subject to full us federal corporate income tax   we have federal and state tax obligations which could reduce our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders   even if we qualify as reits for us federal income tax purposes we will be required to pay us federal state and local taxes on income and property in addition our domestic trss are fully taxable corporations that will be subject to taxes on their income and they may be limited in their ability to deduct interest payments made to us we also will be subject to a  penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among us and trss are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties or if we receive payments for inventory or property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business we may be taxable at the highest corporate income tax rate on a portion of the income arising from a taxable mortgage pool that is allocable to shares held by “disqualified organizations” in addition under certain circumstances we could be subject to a penalty tax for failure to meet certain reit requirements but nonetheless maintains its qualification as a reit for example we may be required to pay a penalty tax with respect to income earned in connection with securitization equity in the event such income is determined not to be qualifying income for purposes of the reit  gross income test but we are otherwise able to remain qualified as a reit to the extent that we or the trss are required to pay us federal state or local taxes we will have less to distribute to shareholders    failure to make required distributions would subject us to tax which would reduce the ability to pay distributions to our shareholders   in order to qualify as a reit we and our reit affiliates must each distribute to our respective shareholders each calendar year at least  of our respective reit taxable income determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain to the extent that we and our reit affiliates each satisfy the  distribution requirement but distribute less than  of net taxable income we or such affiliate will be subject to us federal corporate income tax in addition we or our reit affiliates will incur a  nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which our respective distributions in any calendar year are less than the sum of     •  of ordinary income for that year   •  of capital gain net income for that year and   •  undistributed taxable income from prior years   we and our reit affiliates each intend to distribute our respective net income to our respective shareholders in a manner intended to satisfy the  distribution requirement and to avoid both corporate income tax and the  nondeductible excise tax there is no requirement that any trs of ours or our reit affiliates distribute their aftertax net income to us or our reit affiliates and such trss may to the extent consistent with maintaining our or our reit affiliates’ qualification as a reit determine not to make any current distributions to us or our reit affiliates   our or our reit affiliates’ respective taxable income may substantially exceed our or their respective net income as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or gaap because for example expected capital losses will be deducted in determining our respective gaap net income but may not be deductible in computing our or their respective taxable income gaap net income may also be reduced to the extent we or our reit affiliates have to “markdown” the value of our respective assets to reflect their current value prior to the sale of such assets those markdowns do not comparably reduce taxable income in addition we or our reit affiliates may invest in assets including the equity of securitization entities that generate taxable income in excess of economic income or in advance of the corresponding cash flow from the assets this taxable income may arise for us in the following ways     • repurchase of our debt at a discount including our convertible senior notes or cdo notes payable will generally result in our recognizing reit taxable income in the form of cancellation of indebtedness income generally equal to the amount of the discount   • origination of loans with appreciation interests may be deemed to have original issue discount for federal income tax purposes original issue discount is generally equal to the difference between an obligation’s issue price and its stated redemption price at maturity this “discount” must be recognized as income over the life of the loan even though the corresponding cash will not be received until maturity   • our or our reit affiliates’ loan terms may provide for both an interest “pay” rate and “accrual” rate when this occurs we recognize interest based on the sum of the pay rate and the accrual rate but only receive cash at the pay rate until maturity of the loan at which time all accrued interest is due and payable   • our or our reit affiliates’ loans or unconsolidated real estate may contain provisions whereby the benefit of any principal amortization of the underlying senior debt inures to us or our reit affiliates we or our reit affiliates recognize this benefit as income as the amortization occurs with no related cash receipts until repayment of our loan   • sales or other dispositions of investments in real estate as well as significant modifications to loan terms may result in timing differences between income recognition and cash receipts   although some types of taxable income are excluded to the extent they exceed  of our net income in determining the  distribution requirement we will incur corporate income tax and the  nondeductible excise tax with respect to any taxable income items if we do not distribute those items on an annual basis as a result of the foregoing we may generate less cash flow than taxable income in a particular year in that event we may be required to use cash reserves incur debt or liquidate noncash assets at rates or times that we or it regard as unfavorable in order to satisfy the distribution requirement and to avoid us federal corporate income tax and the  deductible excise tax in that year   if we were to make a taxable distribution of shares of our stock shareholders may be required to sell such shares or sell other assets owned by them in order to pay any tax imposed on such distribution   we may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in shares of our common stock if we were to make such a taxable distribution of shares of our stock shareholders would be required to include the full amount of such distribution as income as a result a shareholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of cash received accordingly shareholders  receiving a distribution of our shares may be required to sell shares received in such distribution or may be required to sell other stock or assets owned by them at a time that may be disadvantageous in order to satisfy any tax imposed on such distribution if a shareholder sells the shares it receives as a dividend in order to pay such tax the sale proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend moreover in the case of a taxable distribution of shares of our stock with respect to which any withholding tax is imposed on a nonus shareholder we may have to withhold or dispose of part of the shares in such distribution and use such withheld shares or the proceeds of such disposition to satisfy the withholding tax imposed while the irs in certain private letter rulings has ruled that a distribution of cash or shares at the election of a reit’s shareholders may qualify as a taxable stock dividend if certain requirements are met it is unclear whether and to what extent we will be able to pay taxable dividends in cash and shares of common stock in any future period in addition if a significant number of our shareholders determine to sell shares of our class a common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends it may put downward pressure on the trading price of our class a common stock   distributions payable by reits do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends   the maximum tax rate applicable to income from ‘‘qualified dividends’’ payable to domestic shareholders that are individuals trusts and estates is currently  distributions of ordinary income payable by reits however generally are not eligible for these reduced rates the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay qualified dividends which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits including our common stock   qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code   qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification our qualification as a reit depends on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis in addition our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes   the tax on prohibited transactions will limit our ability to engage in transactions including certain methods of structuring collateral mortgage obligations ‘‘cmos’’ which would be treated as prohibited transactions for federal income tax purposes   net income that we derive from a prohibited transaction is subject to a  tax the term ‘‘prohibited transaction’’ generally includes a sale or other disposition of property including agency securities but other than foreclosure property as discussed below that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business by us or by a borrower that has issued a shared appreciation mortgage or similar debt instrument to us we could be subject to this tax if we were to dispose of or structure cmos in a manner that was treated as a prohibited transaction for federal income tax purposes the  tax does not apply to gains from the sale of property that is held through a trs or other taxable corporation as is the case with our securitization business although such income will be subject to tax in the hands of the corporation at regular corporate rates   we intend to conduct our operations at the reit level so that no asset that we own or are treated as owning will be treated as or as having been held for sale to customers and that a sale of any such asset will not be treated as having been in the ordinary course of our business as a result we may choose not to engage in certain transactions at the reit level and may limit the structures we utilize for our cmo transactions even though the sales or structures might otherwise be beneficial to us in addition whether property is held ‘‘primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business’’ depends on the particular facts and circumstances we intend to structure our activities to avoid prohibited transaction characterization but no assurance can be given that any property that we sell will not be treated as property held for sale to customers or that we can comply with certain safeharbor provisions of the code that would prevent such treatment   our taxable income is calculated differently than net income based on gaap   our taxable income may substantially differ from our net income based on gaap for example interest income on our mortgage related securities does not necessarily accrue under an identical schedule for us federal income tax purposes as for accounting purposes please see part ii item  “financial statements and supplementary data—note  income taxes” for further information    rapid changes in the values of our target assets may make it more difficult for us to maintain our qualification as a reit or our exemption from the investment company act   if the fair market value or income potential of our assets declines as a result of increased interest rates prepayment rates general market conditions government actions or other factors we may need to increase our real estate assets and income or liquidate our nonreitqualifying assets to maintain our reit qualification or our exemption from the investment company act if the decline in real estate asset values or income occurs quickly this may be especially difficult to accomplish we may have to make decisions that we otherwise would not make absent the reit and investment company act considerations   the company’s qualification as a reit and exemption from us federal income tax with respect to certain assets may be dependent on the accuracy of legal opinions or advice rendered or given or statements by the issuers of assets that the company acquires and the inaccuracy of any such opinions advice or statements may adversely affect the company’s reit qualification and result in significant corporatelevel tax   when purchasing securities the company may rely on opinions or advice of counsel for the issuer of such securities or statements made in related offering documents for purposes of determining whether such securities represent debt or equity securities for us federal income tax purposes and also to what extent those securities constitute reit real estate assets for purposes of the reit asset tests and produce income which qualifies for purposes of the reit income tests in addition when purchasing the equity tranche of a securitization the company may rely on opinions or advice of counsel regarding the qualification of the securitization for exemption from us corporate income tax and the qualification of interests in such securitization as debt for us federal income tax purposes the inaccuracy of any such opinions advice or statements may adversely affect the company’s reit qualification and result in significant corporatelevel tax   new legislation or administrative or judicial action in each instance potentially with retroactive effect could make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit or could reduce the market price of our common shares   the present federal income tax treatment of reits may be modified possibly with retroactive effect by legislative judicial or administrative action at any time which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are continually under review by congress the irs and the us department of the treasury  according to publicly released statements a top legislative priority of the new congress and administration may be to enact significant reform of the internal revenue code including significant changes to taxation of business entities and the deductibility of interest expense and capital investment  there is a substantial lack of clarity around the likelihood timing and details of any such tax reform and the impact of any potential tax reform on us or an investment in our securities and we cannot at this time determine whether any such changes will adversely affect our taxation or the taxation of our shareholders revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could affect or cause us to change our investments and commitments and affect the tax considerations of an investment in us or could reduce the market price of our common shares   if our securitizations are subject to us federal income tax at the entity level it would greatly reduce the amounts those entities would have available to distribute to us and pay their creditors   we own foreign securitizations there is a specific exemption from us federal income tax for nonus corporations that restrict their activities in the united states to trading stock and securities or any activity closely related thereto for their own account whether such trading or such other activity is conducted by the corporation or its employees through a resident broker commission agent custodian or other agent we intend that the consolidated securitization subsidiaries and any other nonus securitizations that are trss will rely on that exemption or otherwise operate in a manner so that they will not be subject to us federal income tax on their net income at the entity level if the irs were to succeed in challenging the tax treatment of our securitizations it could greatly reduce the amount that those securitizations would have available to distribute to their shareholders and to pay to their creditors any reduced distributions would reduce amounts available for distribution to our shareholders   our and our reit affiliates’ ownership of and relationship with trss will be limited and a failure to comply with the limits would jeopardize our and its reit qualification and may result in the application of a  excise tax   a reit may own up to  of the stock of one or more trss a trs may hold assets and earn income that would not be qualifying assets or income if held or earned directly by a reit both the subsidiary and the reit must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a trs a corporation of which a trs directly or indirectly owns more than  of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a trs overall no more than   for taxable years beginning after december   of the value of a reit’s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more trss in addition the trs rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a trs to its parent reit to assure that the trs is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation the rules also impose a  excise tax on certain transactions between a trs and its parent reit that are not conducted on an arm’slength basis    any domestic trss that we or our reit affiliates own or that we or our reit affiliates acquire in the future will pay us federal state and local income tax on their taxable income and their aftertax net income will be available for distribution but will not be required to be distributed   the value of the securities that we or our reit affiliates hold in trss may not be subject to precise valuation accordingly there can be no assurance that we or our reit affiliates will be able to comply with the  limitation discussed above or avoid application of the  excise tax discussed above     compliance with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively   the reit provisions of the internal revenue code limit our ability to hedge mortgagebacked securities preferred securities and related borrowings except to the extent provided by the regulations promulgated by the us treasury department or the treasury regulations any income from a hedging transaction we enter into in the normal course of business primarily to manage risk of interest rate or price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made or ordinary obligations incurred or to be incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets which is clearly identified as specified in the treasury regulations before the close of the day on which it was acquired originated or entered into including gain from the sale or disposition of such a transaction will not constitute gross income for purposes of the  gross income test and will generally constitute nonqualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests as a result we might have to limit use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through trss this could increase the cost of our hedging activities or expose it or us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we or it would otherwise want to bear   fees that we or our reit affiliates receive will not be reit qualifying income   we and our reit affiliates must satisfy two gross income tests annually to maintain qualification as a reit first at least  of a reit’s gross income for each taxable year must consist of defined types of income that derive directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or temporary investment income qualifying income for purposes of that  gross income test generally includes     • rents from real property   • interest on debt secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property and   • dividends or other distributions on and gain from the sale of shares in other reits   second in general at least  of a reit’s gross income for each taxable year must consist of income that is qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test dividends other types of interest gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities income from certain interest rate hedging contracts or any combination of the foregoing gross income from any origination fees we or our reit affiliates obtain or from our sale of property that are held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business is excluded from both income tests   any origination fees we or our reit affiliates receive will not be qualifying income for purposes of the  or  gross income tests applicable to reits under the internal revenue code we typically receive and our reit affiliates may receive initial payments or “points” from borrowers as commitment fees or additional interest so long as the payment is for the use of money rather than for other services provided by us or our reit affiliates we believe that this income should not be classified as nonqualifying origination fees however the internal revenue service may seek to reclassify this income as origination fees instead of commitment fees or interest if we cannot satisfy the internal revenue code’s income tests as a result of a successful challenge of our classification of this income we may not qualify as a reit any fees for services such as advisory fees or brokerdealer fees received by us or our reit affiliates will not qualify for either income test any such fees earned by a trs of ours or of one of our reit affiliates would not be subject to tax and any distributions from trss would be qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test but not for the  gross income test   a portion of the dividends we distribute may be deemed a return of capital for federal income tax purposes   the amount of dividends we distribute to our common and preferred shareholders in a given quarter may not correspond to our taxable income for such quarter consequently a portion of the dividends we distribute may be deemed a return of capital for federal income tax purposes and will not be taxable but will reduce shareholders’ basis in the underlying common or preferred shares    our ability to use trss and consequently our ability to establish feegenerating businesses and invest in securitizations will be limited by the election made by us to be taxed as a reit which may adversely affect returns to our shareholders   overall no more than   for taxable years beginning after december   of the value of a reit’s assets may consist of securities of one or more trss we and trft currently own and we trft and any other reit affiliates may own in the future interests in additional trss however our ability to expand the feegenerating businesses of our and trft’s current trss and future trss we or our reit affiliates may form will be limited by our and our reit affiliates need to meet this  test which may adversely affect distributions we pay to our shareholders   if trft fails to qualify as a reit then we also would very likely fail to qualify as a reit and if any other significant reit affiliate fails to qualify as a reit it would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit   trft is a reit subject to all of the risks discussed above with respect to rait if trft fails to qualify as a reit then we also would very likely fail to qualify as a reit because the income we receive from and assets we hold through trft make up a significant portion of our total income and assets and materially affect our ability to meet reit qualification tests the same would be true with respect to other reit affiliates if the income derived from such reit affiliate becomes a significant part of our income   other regulatory and legal risks of our business   our reputation business and operations could be adversely affected by regulatory compliance failures   potential regulatory action poses a significant risk to our reputation and thereby to our business our business is subject to extensive regulation in the united states we operate our business so as to comply with the internal revenue code’s reit rules and regulations and so as to remain exempt from registration as an investment company under the investment company act in addition we are subject to regulation under the exchange act and various other statutes a number of our investing activities such as our lending business are subject to regulation by various us state regulators each of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has regulatory powers dealing with many aspects of our business including the authority to grant and in specific circumstances to cancel permissions to carry on particular businesses a failure to comply with the obligations imposed by any of the regulations binding on us or to maintain any of the licenses required to be maintained by us could result in investigations sanctions monetary penalties and reputational damage     loss of our investment company act exemption would affect us adversely   we seek to conduct our operations so that we are not required to register as an investment company under section a of the investment company act a company is not deemed to be an “investment company” if     • it neither is nor holds itself out as being engaged primarily nor proposes to engage primarily in the business of investing reinvesting or trading in securities and   • it neither is engaged nor proposes to engage in the business of investing reinvesting owning holding or trading in securities and does not own or propose to acquire “investment securities” having a value exceeding  of the value of its total assets exclusive of government securities and cash items on an unconsolidated basis which we refer to as the  test “investment securities” excludes us government securities and securities of majorityowned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company under section c or section c of the investment company act relating to issuers whose securities are held by not more than  persons or whose securities are held only by qualified purchasers as defined   we rely on the  test because we are a holding company that conducts our businesses through whollyowned or majorityowned subsidiaries as a result the securities issued by our subsidiaries that are excepted from the definition of “investment company” under section c or section c of the investment company act together with any other investment securities we may own may not have a combined value in excess of  of the value of our total assets exclusive of government securities and cash items on an unconsolidated basis based on the relative value of our investment in trft on the one hand and our investment in rait partnership on the other hand we can comply with the  test only if rait partnership itself complies with the  test or an exemption other than those provided by sections c or c because the principal exemptions that rait partnership relies upon to allow it to meet the  test are those provided by sections cc or c relating to subsidiaries primarily engaged in specified real estate activities we are limited in the types of businesses in which we may engage through our subsidiaries   because rait partnership and the two whollyowned subsidiaries through which we hold  of the partnership interests in rait partnership—rait general inc and rait limited inc—will not be relying on section c or c for their respective investment company act exemptions our investments in these securities will not constitute “investment securities” for purposes of the  test if rait partnership is otherwise exempt from the investment company act    rait partnership our subsidiary that holds directly and through whollyowned or majorityowned subsidiaries a substantial portion of our assets intends to conduct its operations so that it is not required to register as an investment company in reliance on the exemption from investment company act regulation provided under section cc rait partnership may also from time to time rely on the exemption from investment company act regulation provided under section c   any entity relying on section cc for its investment company act exemption must have at least  of its portfolio invested in qualifying assets which in general must consist of mortgage loans mortgage backed securities that represent the entire ownership in a pool of mortgage loans and other liens on and interests in real estate and another  of its portfolio invested in other real estaterelated assets based on noaction letters issued by the staff of the sec we classify our investments in mortgage loans as qualifying assets as long as the loans are “fully secured” by an interest in real estate that is if the loantovalue ratio of the loan is equal to or less than  then we consider the loan to be a qualifying asset we do not consider loans with loantovalue ratios in excess of  to be qualifying assets that come within the  basket but only real estaterelated assets that come within the  basket based on a noaction letter issued by the staff of the sec we treat most of our mezzanine loans as qualifying assets because we usually obtain a first lien position on the entire ownership interest of a special purpose entity or spe that owns only real property or that owns the entire ownership interest in a second spe that owns only real property and otherwise comes within the conditions of the noaction letter and we treat any remaining mezzanine loans as real estaterelated assets that come within the  basket the treatment of other investments as qualifying assets and real estaterelated assets including equity investments in subsidiaries is based on the characteristics of the underlying asset in the case of a directly held investment or the characteristics of the assets of the subsidiary in the case of equity investments in subsidiaries   any entity relying on section c for its investment company act exemption must be primarily engaged directly or through majorityowned subsidiaries in one or more specified businesses including a business described in section cc or in one or more of such businesses from which not less than  of its gross income during its last fiscal year was derived together with an additional business or businesses other than investing reinvesting owning holding or trading in securities   trft like rait is a holding company that conducts its operations through subsidiaries accordingly we intend to monitor trft’s holdings such that it will satisfy the  test similar to securities issued to us the securities issued to trft by its subsidiaries that are excepted from the definition of “investment company” by section c or c of the investment company act together with any other investment securities trft may own may not have a combined value in excess of  of the value of its total assets on an unconsolidated basis this requirement limits the types of businesses in which trft may engage through these subsidiaries   we make the determination of whether an entity is a majorityowned subsidiary of rait rait partnership or trft the investment company act defines a majorityowned subsidiary of a person as a company  or more of the outstanding voting securities of which are owned by such person or by another company which is a majorityowned subsidiary of such person the investment company act further defines voting securities as any security presently entitling its owner or holder to vote for the election of trustees of a company we treat companies including future securitization subsidiaries in which we own at least a majority of the outstanding voting securities as majorityowned subsidiaries for purposes of the  test neither rait rait partnership nor trft has requested the sec to approve our treatment of any company as a majorityowned subsidiary and the sec has not done so if the sec were to disagree with our treatment of one or more companies including securitizations as majorityowned subsidiaries we would need to adjust our respective investment strategies and invest our respective assets in order to continue to pass the  test any such adjustment in its investment strategy could have a material adverse effect on trft and us   a majority of trft’s subsidiaries are limited by the provisions of the investment company act and the rules and regulations promulgated under the act with respect to the assets in which they can invest to avoid being regulated as an investment company in particular trft’s subsidiaries that are securitizations generally rely on rule a an exemption from the investment company act provided for certain structured financing vehicles that pool incomeproducing assets and issue securities backed by those assets such structured financings may not engage in portfolio management practices resembling those employed by mutual funds accordingly each trft securitization subsidiary that relies on rule a is subject to an indenture which contains specific guidelines and restrictions limiting the discretion of the securitization the indenture prohibits the securitization from acquiring and disposing of assets primarily for the purpose of recognizing gains or decreasing losses resulting from market value changes certain sales and purchases of assets such as dispositions of collateral that has gone into default or is at risk of imminent default may be made so long as they do not violate the guidelines contained in each indenture and are not based primarily on changes in market value the proceeds of permitted dispositions may be reinvested in collateral that is consistent with the credit profile of the securitization under specific and predetermined guidelines in addition absent obtaining further guidance from the sec substitutions of assets may not be made solely for the purpose of enhancing the investment returns of the holders of the equity securities issued by the securitization as a result of these restrictions trft’s securitization subsidiaries may suffer losses on their assets and trft may suffer losses on its investments in its securitization subsidiaries    if the combined value of the investment securities issued to trft by its subsidiaries that are excepted by section c or c of the investment company act together with any other investment securities trft may own exceeds  of trft’s total assets on an unconsolidated basis trft may be required either to substantially change the manner in which it conducts its operations or to rely on section c or c to avoid having to register as an investment company as a result of the relative values of rait partnership and trft it is likely that trft would rely on the section c or c exemptions which would increase the assets we hold included in the  basket for purposes of the  test which would increase the effects that variations in the value of rait partnership’s assets would have on its ability to comply with the  test and accordingly our ability to remain exempt from registration as an investment company   none of rait rait partnership or trft has received a noaction letter from the sec regarding whether it complies with the investment company act or how its investment or financing strategies fit within the exclusions from regulation under the investment company act that it is using to the extent that the sec provides more specific or different guidance regarding for example the treatment of assets as qualifying real estate assets or real estaterelated assets we may be required to adjust these investment and financing strategies accordingly any additional guidance from the sec could provide additional flexibility to us and trft or it could further inhibit the ability of trft and our combined company to pursue our respective investment and financing strategies which could have a material adverse effect on us see item — “business—certain reit and investment company act limits on our strategiesinvestment company act limits”   our ownership limitation may restrict business combination opportunities   to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code no more than  in value of our outstanding capital shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year to preserve our reit qualification our declaration of trust generally prohibits any person from owning more than  or with respect to our original promoter resource america inc  of our outstanding common shares and provides that     • a transfer that violates the limitation is void   • a transferee gets no rights to the shares that violate the limitation   • shares acquired that violate the limitation transfer automatically to a trust whose trustee has all voting and other rights   • shares in the trust will be sold and the record holder will receive the net proceeds of the sale   the ownership limitation may discourage a takeover or other transaction that our shareholders believe to be desirable   preferred shares may prevent change in control   our declaration of trust authorizes our board of trustees to issue preferred shares to establish the preferences and rights of any preferred shares issued to classify any unissued preferred shares and reclassify any previously classified but unissued preferred shares without shareholder approval the issuance of preferred shares could delay or prevent a change in control apart from the ownership limitation even if a majority of our shareholders want control to change   maryland antitakeover statutes may restrict business combination opportunities   as a maryland reit we are subject to various provisions of maryland law which impose restrictions and require that specified procedures be followed with respect to the acquisition of “control shares” representing at least ten percent of our aggregate voting power and certain takeover offers and business combinations including but not limited to combinations with persons who own onetenth or more of our outstanding shares while we have elected to “opt out” of the control share acquisition statute our board of trustees has the right to rescind the election at any time without notice to our shareholders     if our subsidiaries that are not registered as investment advisers under the investment advisers act that provide collateral management servicing or advisory services to securitizations or other investment vehicles were required to so register it could hinder our operating performance and negatively impact our business and subject us to additional regulatory burdens and costs that we are not currently subject   where our subsidiary provides collateral management servicing or advisory services solely to one or more entities that do not invest in “securities” or regarding assets that are not “securities portfolios” that provide sufficient “regulatory assets under management” as such terms are defined in the investment advisers act such subsidiary will not engage in activities that would require it to register as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act we have determined that none of rait partnership or rait’s affiliates providing servicing to the fl securitizations need to register as an investment adviser for rait partnership’s collateral management services to rait i and rait ii or rait’s affiliates providing servicing to the fl securitizations respectively we have not requested the sec to approve our determination that these subsidiaries do not need to register as investment advisers under the investment advisers act and the sec has not done so if the sec or any applicable state regulatory authority were to  disagree with our determination we would need to register those companies as investment advisers and comply with all applicable requirements which might require those subsidiaries to adjust the manner in which they provide services which could hinder their respective operating performance and negatively impact their respective business and subject them to additional regulatory burdens and costs that they are not currently subject to   our settlement in  with the sec of its investigation concerning our subsidiary taberna capital management llc or tcm restricts our ability to serve as an investment advisor until september  which may require us to forgo opportunities   we may be subject to “lender liability” litigation   in recent years a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories collectively termed “lender liability” generally lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty whether implied or contractual of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders we cannot assure you that such claims will not arise or that we will not be subject to significant liability if a claim of this type were to arise   risks relating to our securities   we have not established a minimum dividend payment level and we cannot assure you of our ability to pay dividends in the future or the amount of any dividends   our board of trustees will determine the amount and timing of distributions in making this determination our trustees will consider all relevant factors including reit minimum distribution requirements the amount of cash available for distribution restrictions under maryland law capital expenditures and reserve requirements and general operational requirements we cannot assure you that we will be able to make distributions in the future or in amounts similar to our past distributions we may need to fund distributions through borrowings returning capital or selling assets which may be available only at commercially unattractive terms if at all any of the foregoing could adversely affect the market price of our common shares   the price of our common shares and other securities historically has been volatile this volatility may affect the price at which anyone holding our common shares or other securities could sell them and the sale of substantial amounts of our common shares or such other securities could adversely affect the price of our common shares or such other securities   the market price for our common shares has varied between a high of  on february   and a low of  on november   in the twelve month period ending on march   this volatility may affect the price at which you could sell the common shares other securities we have issued have also had volatile market prices the market prices of our securities are likely to continue to be volatile and the trading volume subject to significant fluctuations in response to market and other factors including the other risk factors discussed in this report variations in our quarterly operating results from our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors downward revisions in securities analysts’ estimates and announcement by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments this volatility and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our common shares to fluctuate substantially which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their common shares may induce shareholder activism and may otherwise negatively affect the price or liquidity of our common shares   future sales of our common shares in the public market could lower the market price for our common shares and adversely impact the trading price of the notes   in the future we may sell additional common shares to raise capital in addition a substantial number of our common shares are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of the issued and issuable warrants or the warrants

of our outstanding senior convertible notes we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect if any that they may have on the market price for our common shares the issuance and sale of

o f financial condition and results of operations   overview   we are an internallymanaged maryland real estate investment trust or reit focused on providing commercial real estate financing throughout the united states  as explained below we plan to continue to opportunistically divest our nonlending businesses and assets however presently we also own and manage a portfolio of commercial real estate properties and manage real estate assets for third parties we were formed in august  and commenced operations in january    see “part i item  business” above or the business description which is incorporated herein by reference for further description of our company business strategy  developments targeted capital structure strategy and other matters   see also part ii item  “financial statements and supplementary data—note  subsequent events”   as described in the business description we are implementing a strategy to transition rait to a streamlined business model that is focused on our core cre lending business we began executing this strategy in  and will continue this pursuit throughout    as described in the business description our transformational strategy is focused on     • concentrating rait’s business on our core middlemarket cre lending business   • opportunistically divesting while maximizing the value of our legacy reo portfolio and ultimately minimizing our reo holdings   • opportunistically divesting and maximizing the value of our commercial property management operations including our urban retail property management business   • optimizing our capital structure and reducing our outstanding indebtedness   • reducing our total expense base  and   • most importantly reallocating capital into and growing our core middle market cre lending activities   our transition is ongoing and once completed will result in a simpler more cost efficient and lower leveraged business model that is focused on the core cre business  we believe that we will be able to enhance shareholder value by delivering stable and repeatable riskadjusted returns  we expect to accomplish that with a significantly lower expense base that matches our lending focused strategy with an appropriate capital structure and lower levels of debt     we believe we made significant progress executing our strategy to return to our focus on cre lending including the following steps       • the irt management internalization resulted in irt paying rait  million to acquire irt’s external advisor and our multifamily property management business and  million for our entire irt common stock position  rait incurred  million of internalization and transition expenses and the divestiture and deconsolidation of irt and our multifamily property management business lowered our compensation and ga expense run rate by approximately  million  these transactions led to the operations of irt and our multifamily property management business being presented as discontinued operations in our financial results       • we expect to divest urban retail our commercial property focused property management business  once urban is divested we expect our revenues and our expenses to each decline by approximately  million       • we ended  with a reo property portfolio with an aggregate book value of  million  we have been opportunistically selling down our reo property portfolio  we sold  properties for  million in aggregate gross proceeds during  through january   after costs and repaying related indebtedness we received net proceeds of approximately  million  as of december   we identified  properties for disposition aggregating  million of book value  one of these properties was sold in january  for  million  we expect to sell or dispose of the remainder of the  million of properties during        • the cumulative effect of these initiatives has led to a  reduction in our base compensation and ga expense run rate from  million in  to approximately  million in   we are targeting more expense reductions as the transformation continues into        • our strategy also contemplates reducing our overall leverage during  rait’s indebtedness declined by  million or  from  billion to  billion and total recourse debt excluding rait’s secured credit facilities declined by  million or   rait’s corporate leverage excluding deconsolidated subsidiaries declined from  to  at the end of   we anticipate recycling between approximately  million to  million through this capital reallocation in     which we believe has the potential of generating approximately  million to  million in new loan originations and we have been building a loan origination pipeline to match our capital generation  see the business description and “liquidity and capital resources” below for further discussion of our longer term target capital structure goals including leverage     • in support of our return to our core cre lending strategy we implemented management and board changes to better align with our strategic direction     o rait announced a new board leadership structure and executive management changes to oversee and execute rait’s strategy and its transition to a more streamlined lendingfocused cost efficient and lower leveraged business model   o on october   rait announced that michael j malter who joined rait’s board in november  was elected by the board to serve as its independent chairman     o effective december   scott davidson rait’s president and former head of its lending business was named rait’s chief executive officer and concurrently was appointed to the board   o on february   rait announced that thomas d wren a former banking executive and federal banking regulator had joined the board as a new independent trustee with substantial financial regulatory capital markets and mortgage reit expertise the third new trustee to join rait’s nineperson board since november      o on february   rait announced that paul w kopsky jr an accomplished executive with extensive financial and operational leadership expertise across a diverse range of industries was named to succeed james j sebra as rait’s chief financial officer and treasurer     during  we generated gaap net income loss allocable to common shares of  million or  per common sharediluted as compared to  million or  per common sharediluted during  during  our cash available for distribution or cad decreased to  million or  per common share from  million or  per common share for   cad is a nongaap financial measure  for management’s definitions and discussion of the usefulness of cad to investors and management and a reconciliation of our reported net income loss to our cad see “nongaap financial measures” below for  our cre lending business originated  million of loans and completed its  th floating rate loan securitization in november  which we refer to as rait fl  rait fl was a  million floating rate loan securitization and issued  million of investment grade bonds with a weighted average interest cost of libor plus   see “securitization summary” below for further discussion of fl   trends that may affect our business   the following trends may affect our business   trends relating to capital markets   we are generally seeing more volatility in the capital markets relevant to our common and preferred shares and our recourse indebtedness which may affect our ability to raise capital through public offerings of our securities in these categories in the next year   trends relating to cre debt market maturities   we believe a sizable amount of cre debt held by cmbs issuers banks life insurance companies and other financing sources will mature each year for the next several years  we believe these maturities will drive refinancing and create opportunities for us to originate cre loans   trends relating to originating and financing conduit loans and bridge loans  our loan origination volume was lower during  as compared to historical levels due to volatility in interest rates and bond spreads along with the use of capital to retire our corporate unsecured debt  we are expecting increased amounts of loan repayments in  as compared to historical periods as borrowers seek to take advantage of the strong real estate market fundamentals and either sell or refinance their properties  as a result given higher levels of competition we expect loan origination volumes to increase in  and future periods as capital is recycled from reo property sales and as loans repayments and as borrowers seek to refinance their loans  however competition to originate loans is increasing as market participants seek to capitalize on the sizeable level of commercial real estate loans that are maturing in  and        trends relating to investments in real estate  we have been opportunistically selling down our reo property portfolio  as of december   we identified  properties for disposition aggregating  million of book value  one of these properties was sold in january  for  million  we expect to sell or dispose of the remainder of the  million during  from a performance perspective we expect the occupancy and rental rates of our office and retail properties to improve or remain stable during  as a result of stable leasing activity during  in our office and retail portfolios and stable or improved economic conditions within the relevant markets of our office and retail properties      interest rate environment  while interest rates in  continued to remain at historically low levels volatility increased as the federal reserve began to tighten monetary policies in the second half of   we believe market participants expect that the future interest rate environment will be higher than  as the federal reserve pursues its unemployment and inflationary goals in the event interest rates rise significantly we may be impacted see our discussion below under item a—“quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk management” for a summary of the possible effects on our income and expenses we use floating rate facilities and longterm floating rate securitization bonds to finance our investments to the extent the fixed interest rate on our commercial loans do not appropriately match the floating interest rate on the securitization bonds the loans collateralize we may utilize interest rate derivative contracts to convert our floating rate liabilities into fixedrate liabilities effectively match funding our assets with our liabilities   prepayment rates  prepayment rates generally increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise but changes in prepayment rates are difficult to predict prepayment rates on our assets also may be affected by other factors including without limitation conditions in the housing real estate and financial markets general economic conditions and the relative interest rates on adjustablerate and fixedrate loans see “securitization summary” below for a discussion of the impact of prepayments on the returns we receive from our retained interests in our consolidated securitizations as a result of the current low interest rate environment there may be an increase in prepayment rates in our commercial loan portfolio which could decrease our net investment income and a corresponding increase in prepayment rates of our debt securities which may result in our recognizing noncash expenses due to fair value adjustments our cre loan portfolio continues to experience elevated levels of loan payoffs as borrowers are taking advantage of the strong real estate markets to either sell or refinance their properties  as a result our net interest margin has declined from  through  as loans repay and leverage declines  loan repayments were  million during    transitional impact of strategy   we expect that our implementation of the transformative strategy to focus rait on cre lending described above will cause  to be a transitional year for rait  as described above rait is implementing a strategy which will continue rait’s transition away from real estate ownership  this has resulted and we expect it to continue to result in a large volume of asset sales and a sizeable deleveraging to rait’s balance sheet  since most of the debt securing our reo properties collateralizes securitizations loan repayments and asset sales result in a deleveraging because of the sequential pay structures of the securitization  we expect our net interest margin and property net operating income to decline in  as compared to   while we are expecting to see a reduction in costs we do not expect the savings to offset the reduction in earnings from asset sales and loan repayments   assets under management   assets under management or aum is an operating measure representing the total assets that we own or are managing for third parties while not all aum generates fee income it is an important operating measure to gauge our asset growth volume of originations size and scale of our operations and our performance aum includes our total investment portfolio and assets managed for third parties   the table below summarizes our aum as of december   and december   dollars in thousands       aum as of december       aum as of

portfolio was comprised of  million and  million respectively of assets collateralizing rait i and rait ii  million and  billion respectively of investments in real estate of rait and  million and  million respectively of commercial mortgage loans mezzanine loans and preferred equity interests that were not securitized as of december   and  our commercial real estate portfolio was also comprised of  million and  million respectively of assets collateralizing our floating rate securitizations    the irt management internalization which occurred in december of  decreased our aum by approximately  billion as irt became the manager of its real estate assets our multifamily real estate assets and thirdparty real estate assets which is included within the commercial real estate portfolio in the table above    urban retail provides management andor leasing services to  properties with  square feet in  states as of december   as noted above we intend to divest urban retail during  as part of our strategy to focus on cre lending when urban retail is divested we expect that our aum would be reduced by approximately  billion    securitization summary   overview we have used securitizations to match fund the interest rates and maturities of our assets with the interest rates and maturities of the related financing this strategy has helped us reduce interest rate and funding risks on our portfolios for the longterm a securitization is a structure in which multiple classes of debt and equity are issued by a special purpose entity to finance a portfolio of assets cash flow from the portfolio of assets is used to repay the securitization liabilities sequentially in order of seniority the most senior classes of debt typically have credit ratings of “aaa” through “bbb–” and therefore can be issued at yields that are lower than the average yield of the loans collateralizing the securitization the debt tranches are typically rated based on portfolio quality diversification and structural subordination the equity securities issued by the securitization are the “first loss” piece of the capital structure but they are entitled to all residual amounts available for payment after the obligations to the debt holders have been satisfied historically the stated maturity of the debt issued by a securitization we have sponsored and consolidated has been between  and  years however we expect the weighted average life of such debt to be shorter than the stated maturity due to the financial condition of the borrowers on the underlying loans and the characteristics of such loans including the existence and frequency of exercise of any permitted prepayment the prevailing level of interest rates the actual default rate and the actual level of any recoveries on any defaulted loans debt issued by these securitizations is nonrecourse to rait and payable solely from the payments by the borrowers on the loans collateralizing these securitizations these assets are in most cases “nonrecourse” or limited recourse loans secured by commercial real estate assets or real estate entities this means that we look primarily to the assets securing the loan for repayment subject to certain standard exceptions   as of december   we have sponsored six securitizations with varying amounts of retained or residual interests held by us which we consolidate in our financial statements as follows rait i rait ii rait fl trust or rait fl rait fl trust or rait fl and rait fl trust or rait fl and rait fl or raitfl  as discussed below we exercised our rights and unwound two other securitizations we had sponsored rait fl trust or rait fl in  and rait fl trust or rait fl in the third quarter of  we refer to rait fl rait fl rait fl rait fl rait fl and rait fl as the fl securitizations the assets and liabilities of these securitizations are presented at amortized cost in our consolidated financial statements we originated substantially all of the loans collateralizing rait i rait ii and the fl securitizations we serve as the collateral manager servicer and special servicer on rait i and rait ii and as servicer and special servicer for each of the fl securitizations   over time our returns on and cash flows from our retained interests in our securitizations generally decrease as the senior classes of debt bearing relatively lower interest rates are paid down by collateral pool payments and other proceeds leaving more junior classes of debt bearing relatively higher interest rates on the smaller collateral pool  as a result we continue to evaluate strategies to manage the returns on our capital allocated to our retained interests in each of our securitizations consistent with our rights and obligations under our securitizations and relevant market conditions which may include without limitation unwinding a securitization and rolling the remaining collateral over to a new securitization and may involve where applicable selling our properties securing loans included in the collateral pool and repaying such loans  with respect to our floating rate cmbs securitizations described below we have implemented a process of unwinding the fl securitizations when because of loan repayments the securitizations become inefficient   securitization performance rait i and rait ii contain interest coverage triggers or ic triggers and over collateralization triggers or oc triggers that must be met in order for us to receive our subordinated management fees and our lowerrated debt or residual equity returns if the ic triggers or oc triggers are not met in a given period then the cash flows are redirected from lower rated tranches and used to repay the principal amounts to the senior tranches of cdo notes payable these conditions and the redirection of cash flow continue until the triggers are met by curing the underlying payment defaults paying down the cdo notes payable or other actions permitted under the relevant securitization indenture as of the most recent payment information all applicable ic triggers and oc triggers continue to be met for rait i and rait ii and we continue to receive all of our management fees interest and residual returns from these securitizations the fl securitizations do not have ic triggers and oc triggers   repayment of the loans collateralizing rait i and rait ii outside their contractual maturities increased during  and we expect it to continue to increase in  through  in addition we have  properties held for disposition with an aggregate net book value of  million as of december    the related indebtedness of these properties is expected to be repaid with the proceeds of any sales which primarily includes paying down the most senior notes outstanding issued by rait i and rait ii as applicable  we continue to evaluate our real estate portfolio with regards to identifying other possible properties to sell as part of our previously disclosed capital recycling and debt reduction plan  because we own properties that are financed in part by loans collateralizing rait i and rait ii sales of our properties could result in a significant reduction of our securitization notes payable  these repayments have reduced our returns from these securitizations and we expect future repayments to continue to reduce these returns  we continue to evaluate alternative strategies seeking to replace these returns     if the cdo notes issued by rait i and rait ii have not been redeemed in full prior to the distribution date occurring in may  in the case of rait i and june  in the case of rait ii then an auction of the collateral assets of rait i or rait ii as  relevant will be conducted by the relevant trustee periodically thereafter and if certain conditions set forth in the relevant indenture are satisfied such collateral assets will be sold at the auction and the relevant cdo notes will be redeemed in whole but not in part on such distribution date  the first two auctions for rait i were held in november  and february  but no sale occurred as no bids were received   a summary of the investments in our consolidated securitizations as of the most recent payment information is as follows   our legacy securitizations   we sponsored two securitizations in  and      • rait i —we closed rait i in  rait i is

purchase price of  per share this purchase price was equal to the price to the public in the irt october  offering less underwriting discounts or commissions  the irt repurchased shares represented all of the shares of irt common stock we owned   we used approximately  million of the proceeds we received from selling our irt common stock to repay seven mezzanine loans participation interests in these mezzanine loans were held as collateral for our consolidated securitization rait ii and certain other legacy securitizations that we no longer consolidate  as a result of the irt stock repurchase rait determined that it no longer is the primary beneficiary of irt and as a result rait deconsolidated irt as of october    prior to this deconsolidation we identified irt as one of our business segments   the irt management internalization contemplated by the irt internalization agreement was completed on december   and consisted of two parts     • an irt affiliate purchased independence realty advisors llc or the irt advisor which was our subsidiary and irt’s external advisor and     • an irt affiliate purchased identified assets and the assumed identified liabilities relating to our multifamily property management business which we refer to as rait residential including property management contracts relating to apartment properties owned by ourselves irt and third parties     the purchase price paid by irt for the irt management internalization was  million   taberna exit   we disclosed in september  that we were undertaking to exit our taberna securitization segment which included tcm’s business serving as collateral manager of three securitizations which we refer to as t t and t and our holdings of securities issued by those securitizations in december  we assigned or delegated all of tcm’s remaining collateral management agreements to a third party in  we sold all of our holdings of the related securities the december  transactions resulted in our deconsolidation of t and t the two of these three securitizations we had previously consolidated in september  tcm entered into a settlement with the sec to resolve a nonpublic investigation by the sec staff into certain transactions by tcm included in the taberna securitization segment our exit of the taberna securitization segment did not include trft or any of trft’s subsidiaries that were not involved in the taberna securitization segment    reit taxable income to qualify as a reit we are required to make annual dividend payments to our shareholders in an amount at least equal to  of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains in addition to avoid certain us federal excise taxes we are required to make dividend payments to our shareholders in an amount at least equal to  of our reit taxable income for each year because we expect to pay dividends based on the foregoing requirements and not based on our earnings computed in accordance with gaap we expect that our dividends may at times be more or less than our reported earnings as computed in accordance with gaap our board of trustees monitors rait’s reit taxable income and all available net operating losses not utilized in prior years in may  our board reinstated our regular quarterly dividends on our common shares our board of trustees reserves the right to change its dividend policy at any time or from time to time in its sole discretion but expects to continue to declare dividends in at least the amount necessary to maintain rait’s reit status total taxable income and reit taxable income are nongaap financial measurements and do not purport to be an alternative to reported net income determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of liquidity our total taxable income represents the aggregate amount of taxable income generated by us and by our domestic and foreign trss reit taxable income is calculated under us federal tax laws in a manner that in certain respects differs from the calculation of net income pursuant to gaap reit taxable income excludes the undistributed taxable income of our domestic trss which is not included in reit taxable income until distributed to us subject to trs value limitations there is no requirement that our domestic trss distribute their earnings to us reit taxable income however generally includes the taxable income of our foreign trss because we will generally be required to recognize and report our taxable income on a current basis since we are structured as a reit and the internal revenue code requires that we distribute substantially all of our net taxable income in the form of dividends to our shareholders we believe that presenting the information management uses to calculate reit net taxable income is useful to investors in understanding the amount of the minimum dividends that we must make to our shareholders so as to comply with the rules set forth in the internal revenue code because not all companies use identical calculations

reduction in securitizationrelated indebtedness due to repayments of the underlying loans property income  property income decreased  million to  million for the year ended december   from  million

change depreciation and amortization expense  depreciation and amortization expense increased  million to  million for the year ended december   from  million for the year ended december   the

 present for a full year of operation in  partially offset by a decrease of  million of depreciation and amortization expense related to  properties that were disposed of or deconsolidated after

on three of our multifamily properties upon their sale as they were sold for less than their outstanding indebtedness and the outstanding indebtedness has been satisfied this was offset by a loss on the extinguishment of debt of  million related to repurchases and redemptions of our indebtedness primarily driven by the writeoff of the unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the indebtedness asset impairment during the year ended december   we recognized impairment of  million on five office properties one retail property and five multifamily properties that are expected to be sold  we also expensed tenant improvements and straightline rent receivables aggregating  million associated with tenants that vacated our properties early  we also recognized a loss on our retail

due to changes in the reference stock price and volatility income tax benefit provision  for the year ended december   the income tax provision was driven by taxable income generated from the irt

provision was driven by the profitable performance of our taxable operations   income loss from discontinued operations  during the year ended december   income loss from discontinued operations

nonaccrual loans decreased to  of our loan portfolio the increase in our impaired loans as of december   was principally related to a firstmortgage loan which was collateralized by seven properties with an unpaid principal balance of  million  while we believe we have properly reserved for the probable losses in our portfolio we continually monitor our portfolio for evidence of loss and recognize additional provisions for loan losses as circumstances or conditions change   depreciation and amortization expense  depreciation and amortization expense increased  million to  million for

included a  million loss on sale of an asset held by t and t which resulted from the illiquid nature of the investment a  million charge off for certain assets that were previously disposed of and a

deconsolidation of vies  on december   our subsidiary assigned or delegated its rights and responsibilities as collateral manager for the consolidated t and t securitizations as of that date we no

income tax benefit provision  income tax benefit provision for the year ended december   decreased net income by  million due to the profitable performance of our taxable operations  during  we utilized net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our current tax expense however this was offset by the recognition of a deferred tax expense associated with the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  income tax benefit provision for the year ended december   increased net income by  million due to the reversal of a valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets recorded for net operating loss carryforwards income loss from discontinued operations  during the year ended december   income loss from discontinued operations reflected recurring activity from our discontinued

income at irt     nongaap financial measures   cash available for distribution   cash available for distribution or cad is a nongaap financial measure we believe that cad provides investors analysts and management with a meaningful indicator of operating performance management also uses cad among other measures to  evaluate profitability and our board of trustees considers cad in determining our quarterly cash distributions the compensation committee of our board used cad as a performance metric in establishing performancebased compensation awards for  and  for some of our executive officers we also believe that cad is useful because it adjusts for a variety of noncash items such as depreciation and amortization equitybased compensation realized gain loss on assets provision for loan losses and noncash interest income and expense items furthermore cad removes the effect of two securitizations which we refer to as t and t which we consolidated until we exited the taberna business in december    we calculate cad by subtracting from or adding to net income loss attributable to common shareholders the following items depreciation and amortization items including depreciation and amortization straightline rental income or expense amortization of in place leases amortization of deferred financing costs amortization of discount on financings and equitybased compensation changes in the fair value of our financial instruments including such changes reflected in t and t net interest income from t and t realized gains losses on assets provision for loan losses asset impairments acquisition gains or losses and transaction costs certain fee income eliminated in consolidation that is attributable to third parties and onetime events pursuant to changes in gaap and certain other nonrecurring items   in the quarter ended march   we changed our method of calculating cad to exclude the impact of real property sales from cad  we made this change in response to investor feedback to focus cad on our core business activities  in addition we provide guidance regarding our expected cad in future periods and this change removes variability resulting from the ultimate timing of future property sales  we have amended our comparable prior period disclosures to conform with the current period presentation for this change   cad should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss or cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of operating performance for example cad does not adjust for the accrual of income and expenses that may not be received or paid in cash during the associated periods please refer to our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap in part ii item  “financial statements and supplementary data” in addition our methodology for calculating cad may differ from the methodologies used by other comparable companies including other reits when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with these companies   set forth below is a reconciliation of cad to net income loss allocable to common shares for the years ended december    and  dollars in thousands except share information  the reconciliation of cad to net income loss for the years ended december   and  has been conformed to reflect the presentation of irt

commitments to repay borrowings fund and maintain investments pay dividends and other general business needs   see “part i item  business” above or the business description which is incorporated herein by reference for further description of our targeted capital structure strategy which is part of our transformative strategy to return to our core strategy of focusing primarily on being a cre lender  during  we made significant progress towards this targeted capital structure in a number of areas  we made progress in deleveraging as proceeds from asset sales have been used to reduce our overall indebtedness  in  and january  we repaid approximately  million and  million respectively of our unsecured debt obligations and approximately  million and  million respectively of our secured debt obligations  in addition during  the payoff of our legacy cdos has accelerated and leverage excluding irt has been reduced  see “securitization summary” above for further discussion of our strategy with respect to our legacy cdos  we have also implemented expense reduction strategies through structural changes resulting from the irt management internalization the contemplated divestiture of urban retail and divestiture of our cre portfolio which we expect will lead to lower asset management costs and reduce our ratio of compensation and ga expenses to our equity over time and thereby enhance our liquidity    we believe our available cash and restricted cash balances other financing arrangements and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements for the next  months and the foreseeable future   our primary cash requirements are as follows   • to make investments and fund the associated costs   • to repay our indebtedness including repurchasing redeeming or retiring our debt before it becomes due   • to pay our expenses including compensation to our employees   • to pay us federal state and local taxes of our trss and   • to distribute a minimum of  of our reit taxable income and to make investments in a manner that enables us to maintain our qualification as a reit   we intend to meet these liquidity requirements primarily through the following   • the use of our cash and cash equivalent balances of  million as of december     • cash generated from operating activities including net investment income from our investment portfolio and fee income generated by our commercial real estate platform   • proceeds from the sales of assets  including the property sales described in “overview” above    • proceeds from future borrowings including our cmbs facilities and loan participations   • proceeds from alternative sources of financing such as joint ventures or sales of our retained interests in securitizations we sponsor and   • proceeds from future offerings of our securities including through our drspp and atm programs discussed below     cash flows   as of december   and  we maintained cash and cash equivalents of  million and  million respectively our cash and cash equivalents inclusive of cash and cash equivalents related to discontinued operations were generated from the following activities dollars in thousands       for the years ended december                     cash flows from operating activities                   cash flows from investing activities

december   as compared to the same period in  increased  million primarily due to the timing of payments for various accounts payable accrued expenses and other liabilities and a decrease in accrued interest receivable that related to the payoff of loans whose accrual of interest accrual terms differed from their current payment terms  cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  increase primarily due to sales of conduit loans outpacing the originations of conduit loans during  as compared to  where originations of conduit loans outpaced sales of conduit loans     the cash inflow for investing activities for the year ended december   was substantially due to the disposal of discontinued operations for  million proceeds from property dispositions of  million as well as loan repayments of  million outpacing new investments in loans of  million  the cash outflow for investing activities for the year ended december   is substantially due to new investments in loans of  million exceeding loan repayments of  million as well as acquisitions of real estate properties and capital expenditures on real estate assets of  million these cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from the disposition of real estate assets of  million  the cash outflow for investing activities for the  year ended december   is substantially due to new investments in loans of  million which exceeded loan repayments of  million we also had cash outflows of  million due to the acquisition of real estate properties and capital expenditures in our owned real estate assets these cash outflows were partially offset by payoffs we received for our investment in securities totaling  million for the year ended december     the cash outflow from our financing activities during the year ended december   was primarily due to repayments and repurchases of indebtedness net of issuances of  million and distributions to shareholders and noncontrolling interests of  million exceeding proceeds from the issuance of indebtedness of  million  the cash inflow from our financing activities during the year ended december   is primarily due to proceeds from credit facilities and term loans of  million primarily obtained through irt’s acquisition of tsre and proceeds from our cdo notes and floating rate securitizations of  exceeding repayments on our credit facilities loans on real estate and cdo notes of  million and distributions to preferred and common shareholders of  million  the cash inflow from our financing activities during the year ended december   is primarily due to the issuance of our preferred shares and common shares for  million the issuance of noncontrolling interests of  million and proceeds from the issuance of indebtedness net of repayments of  million exceeding distributions to preferred and common shareholders and noncontrolling interests of  million     as a reit we evaluate our dividend coverage based on our cash flow from operating activities excluding acquisition and integration expenses the origination and sale of conduit loans and changes in assets and liabilities during the year ended december   we paid distributions to our preferred shareholders common shareholders and noncontrolling interests of  million and generated cash flows from operating activities before acquisition expenses origination and sale of conduit loans and changes in assets and liabilities of  million the  million of excess distributions was funded through cash flows from the disposition of real estate assets which is included in cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows and totaled  million during the year ended december   capitalization a discussion of our capitalization is incorporated by reference to note  indebtedness note  series d preferred shares and note  shareholders’ equity of notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii item  “financial statements and supplementary data” critical accounting estimates and policies we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of how we report our financial condition and results of operations because their application places the most significant demands on the judgment of our management our financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods the items that include significant estimates are fair value of financial instruments and allowance for loan losses actual results could differ from those estimates revenue recognition for interest income  we recognize interest income from investments in commercial mortgage loans mezzanine loans and preferred equity interests on a yield to maturity basis some of our commercial mortgage loans and mezzanine loans provide for the accrual of interest at specified rates which differ from current payment terms interest income is recognized on such loans at the accrual rate subject to management’s determination that accrued interest and outstanding principal are ultimately collectible management will cease accruing interest on these loans when it determines that the interest income is not collectible based on the ultimate value of the underlying collateral using discounted cash flow models and market based assumptions recognition of rental income  we generate rental income from tenant rent and other tenantrelated activities at our consolidated real estate properties for multifamily real estate properties rental income is recorded when due from residents and recognized monthly as it is earned and realizable under lease terms which are generally for periods of one year or less for retail and office real estate properties rental income is recognized on a straightline basis from the later of the date of the commencement of the lease or the date of acquisition of the property subject to existing leases which averages minimum rents over the terms of the leases leases also typically provide for tenant reimbursement of a portion of common area maintenance and other operating expenses to the extent that a tenant’s pro rata share of expenses exceeds a base year level set in the lease recognition of fee and other income  we generate fee and other income through our various subsidiaries by a funding conduit loans for sale into unaffiliated cmbs securitizations b providing or arranging to provide financing to our borrowers c providing ongoing asset management services to investment portfolios under cancelable management agreements and d providing property management services to third parties we recognize revenue for these activities when the fees are fixed or determinable are evidenced by an arrangement collection is reasonably assured and the services under the arrangement have been  provided while we may receive asset management fees when they are earned we eliminate earned asset management fee income from securitizations while such securitizations are consolidated allowance for loan losses impaired loans and nonaccrual status  we maintain an allowance for loan losses on our investments in commercial mortgage loans and mezzanine loans management’s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based upon expected and inherent risks in the portfolio the estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic conditions management reviews loans for impairment and establishes specific reserves when a loss is probable under the provisions of fasb asc topic  “receivables” a loan is impaired when it is probable that we may not collect all principal and interest payments according to the contractual terms as part of the detailed loan review we consider many factors about the specific loan including payment history asset performance borrower’s financial capability and other characteristics management evaluates loans for nonaccrual status each reporting period a loan is placed on nonaccrual status when the loan payment deficiencies exceed  days payments received for nonaccrual or impaired loans are applied to principal until the loan is removed from nonaccrual status or no longer impaired past due interest is recognized on nonaccrual loans when they are removed from nonaccrual status and are making current interest payments the allowance for loan losses is increased by charges to operations and decreased by chargeoffs net of recoveries we charge off a loan when we determine that all commercially reasonable means of recovering the loan balance have been exhausted  this may occur at a variety of times including when we receive cash or other assets in a preforeclosure sale or take control of the underlying collateral in full satisfaction of the loan upon foreclosure  we consider circumstances such as these to indicate that the loan collection process has ceased and that a loan is uncollectible investments in real estate  investments in real estate are shown net of accumulated depreciation we capitalize those costs that have been evaluated to improve the real property and depreciate those costs on a straightline basis over the useful life of the asset we depreciate real property using the following useful lives buildings and improvements— to  years furniture fixtures and equipment— to  years and tenant improvements—shorter of the lease term or the life of the asset costs for ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred acquisitions of real estate assets and any related intangible assets are recorded initially at fair value under fasb asc topic  “business combinations” fair value is determined by management based on market conditions and inputs at the time the asset is acquired the fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets consisting of land building and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of the value of abovemarket and belowmarket leases for acquired inplace leases and the value of tenant relationships based in each case on their fair values transaction costs and fees incurred related to acquisitions are expensed as incurred upon the acquisition of properties we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building and improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases inplace leases and tenant relationships and assumed debt at the date of acquisition based on the evaluation of information and estimates available at that date in determining the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property abovemarket and belowmarket inplace lease values are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the differences between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the inplace leases and ii management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding inplace leases measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease the capitalized abovemarket lease values and the capitalized belowmarket lease values are amortized as an adjustment to rental income over the lease term the aggregate value of inplace leases is determined by evaluating various factors including an estimate of carrying costs during the expected leaseup periods current market conditions and similar leases in estimating carrying costs management includes real estate taxes insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected leaseup periods based on current market demand management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions legal and other related costs the value assigned to this intangible asset is amortized over the assumed lease up period management reviews our investments in real estate for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the longlived asset’s use and eventual disposition these cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of leasing demand competition and other factors if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a longlived asset an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property transfers of financial assets  we account for transfers of financial assets under fasb asc topic  “transfers and servicing” as either sales or financings transfers of financial assets that result in sales accounting are those in which  the transfer legally isolates the transferred assets from the transferor  the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the transferred assets and no condition both constrains the transferee’s right to pledge or exchange the assets and provides more than a trivial benefit to the transferor and  the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets if the transfer does not meet these criteria the transfer is accounted for as a financing financial assets that are treated as sales are removed from our accounts with any  realized gain loss reflected in earnings during the period of sale financial assets that are treated as financings are maintained on the balance sheet with proceeds received from the legal transfer reflected as securitized borrowings derivative instruments we may use derivative financial instruments to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings certain of the techniques used to hedge exposure to interest rate fluctuations may also be used to protect against declines in the market value of assets that result from general trends in debt markets the principal objective of such agreements is to minimize the risks andor costs associated with our operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions in accordance with fasb asc topic  “derivatives and hedging” we measure each derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts at fair value and record such amounts in our consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or liability for derivatives designated as fair value hedges derivatives not designated as hedges or for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges associated with debt for which we elected the fair value option under fasb asc topic  “financial instruments” the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument are recorded in earnings for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges the changes in the fair value of the effective portions of the derivative are reported in other comprehensive income changes in the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are recognized in earnings fair value of financial instruments  in accordance with fasb asc topic  “fair value measurements and disclosures” fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date where available fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters where observable prices or inputs are not available valuation models are applied these valuation techniques involve management estimation and judgment the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments’ complexity for disclosure purposes assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value hierarchical levels as defined in fasb asc topic  “fair value measurements and disclosures” and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuations of these assets and liabilities are as follows   • level   valuations are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date the types of assets carried at level  fair value generally are equity securities listed in active markets as such valuations of these investments do not entail a significant degree of judgment   • level   valuations are based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly fair value assets and liabilities that are generally included in this category are unsecured reit note receivables commercial mortgagebacked securities or cmbs receivables and certain financial instruments classified as derivatives where the fair value is based on observable market inputs   • level   inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability generally assets and liabilities carried at fair value and included in this category are trups and subordinated debentures trust preferred obligations and cdo notes payable where observable market inputs do not exist the availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial asset or liability and is affected by a wide variety of factors including for example the type of investment whether the investment is new whether the investment is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market and the current market condition to the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market the determination of fair value requires more judgment accordingly the degree of judgment exercised by us in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level  fair value is a marketbased measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entityspecific measure therefore even when market assumptions are not readily available our own assumptions are set to reflect those that management believes market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date we use prices and inputs that management believes are current as of the measurement date including during periods of market dislocation in periods of market dislocation the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments this condition could cause an instrument to be transferred from level  to level  or level  to level   many financial instruments have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace bid prices reflect the highest price that buyers in the market are willing to pay for an asset ask prices represent the lowest price that sellers in the market are willing to accept for an asset for financial instruments whose inputs are based on bidask prices we do not require that fair value always be a predetermined point in the bidask range our policy is to allow for midmarket pricing and adjusting to the point within the bidask range that results in our best estimate of fair value fair value for certain of our level  financial instruments is derived using internal valuation models these internal valuation models include discounted cash flow analyses developed by management using current interest rates estimates of the term of the particular instrument specific issuer information and other market data for securities without an active market in accordance with fasb asc topic  “fair value measurements and disclosures” the impact of our own credit spreads is also considered when measuring the fair value of financial assets or liabilities including derivative contracts where appropriate valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors including bidask spreads credit quality and market liquidity these adjustments are applied on a consistent basis and are based on observable inputs where available management’s estimate of fair value requires significant management judgment and is subject to a high degree of variability based upon market conditions the availability of specific issuer information and management’s assumptions for further discussion on fair value of our financial instruments see item  “financial statements and supplementary data note  fair value of financial instruments” offbalance sheet arrangements and commitments as of december   we did not have any

qualita tive disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk results primarily from changes in the credit risks of our portfolio and changes in interest rates we are exposed to credit risk and interest rate risk related to our investments in commercial mortgage loans and mezzanine loans and debt instruments credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in a borrower’s ability to meet its financial obligations under agreedupon terms the degree of credit risk varies based on many factors including the concentration of the asset or transaction relative to our entire portfolio the credit characteristics of the borrower the contractual terms of a borrower’s agreements and the availability and quality of collateral our senior management regularly evaluates and approves credit standards and oversees the credit risk management function related to our portfolio of investments our senior management’s responsibilities include ensuring the adequacy of our credit risk management infrastructure overseeing credit risk management strategies and methodologies monitoring conditions in real estate and other markets having an impact on our lending activities and evaluating and monitoring overall credit risk credit summary and concentrations of credit risk our investment portfolio had the following key credit statistics as of december     commercial real estate loans —we had seven loans on nonaccrual status most of which were originated prior to  with a carrying value of  million or  of our commercial real estate loan portfolio our allowance for losses for our commercial loan portfolio was  million or  of our nonaccrual loans and pertained to loans with an unpaid principal balance of  million in our normal course of business we engage in lending activities with borrowers throughout the united states as of december   no single borrower or collateral issuer represented greater than  of our entire portfolio the largest concentration by property type in our commercial mortgage loans and mezzanine loan portfolio was office property which made up approximately  of our commercial mortgage loan and mezzanine loan portfolio for further information on each of our portfolios please refer to the portfolio summaries in item —“business” we also seek to mitigate the risk of default by borrowers on our floating rate loans in the event of significant increases in the applicable interest rates by seeking to have these borrowers enter into interest rate swap agreements capping their exposure to such increases interest rate risk management interest rates may be affected by economic geopolitical monetary and fiscal policy market supply and demand and other factors generally outside our control and such factors may be highly volatile our interest rate risk sensitive assets and liabilities and derivatives will be typically held for longterm investment and not held for sale purposes historically we have used securitizations to finance our investments to limit interest rate risk by matching the terms of our investment assets with the terms of our liabilities and to the extent necessary through the use of hedging instruments we intend to reduce interest rate and funding risk allowing us to focus on managing credit risk through our underwriting process and continual credit analysis  as expected during  interest rate swap agreements relating to rait i and rait ii terminated in accordance with their terms we make investments that are either floating rate or fixed rate our floating rate investments will generally be priced at a fixed spread over an index such as libor that reprices either quarterly or every  days given the frequency of future price changes in our floating rate investments changes in interest rates are not expected to have a material effect on the value of these investments increases or decreases in libor will have a corresponding increase or decrease in our interest income and the matchfunded interest expense thereby reducing the net earnings impact on our overall portfolio our interest income is also protected from decreases in interest rates due to interest rate floors on our investments in commercial mortgage loans and mezzanine loans in the event that longterm interest rates increase the value of our fixedrate investments would be diminished we may consider hedging this risk in the future if the benefit outweighs the cost of the hedging strategy such changes in interest rates would not have a material effect on the income from these investments  as of december   we use a limited number of interest raterelated derivatives to hedge fixed and variable cash flows associated with our loans these derivatives have an aggregate notional value of  million and are used to swap the fixed cash flows associated with fixed rate loans into variablerate payments or cap variable rate cash flows over the lives of the loans as of december   the interest raterelated derivatives had an aggregate asset fair value of  million these derivatives are not designated in hedging relationships  changes in the fair value of these instruments that are not designated as hedges under fasb asc topic  “derivatives and hedging” are recorded in earnings  these derivatives have been excluded from the table below as their impact to our interest rate risk under the scenarios presented in the table is insignificant the following table summarizes the interest income and interest expense for a month period and the change in the net fair value of our

of december   dollars in thousands except share and per share amounts     note  the company rait financial trust invests in and manages a portfolio of realestate related assets including direct ownership of real estate properties and provides a comprehensive set of debt financing options to the real estate industry references to “rait” “we” “us” and “our” refer to rait financial trust and its subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires rait is a selfmanaged and selfadvised maryland real estate investment trust or reit we finance a substantial portion of our investments through borrowing and securitization strategies seeking to match the maturities and terms of our financings with the maturities and terms of those investments on december   the management internalization of one of our previously consolidated variable interest entities independence realty trust inc or irt was completed pursuant to the september   securities and asset purchase agreement or the irt internalization agreement  the irt management internalization consisted of two parts i the acquisition of independence realty advisors llc or the irt advisor which was our subsidiary and irt’s external advisor and ii the acquisition of certain assets and the assumption of certain liabilities relating to our multifamily property management business which we referred to as rait residential including property management contracts relating to apartment properties owned by ourselves irt and third parties  the purchase price paid by irt for the irt management internalization was  subject to certain pro rations at closing  as part of the same agreement we sold all of the  shares of irt’s common stock owned by certain of our subsidiaries on october    see note  discontinued operations for further information regarding the irt management internalization and its effects on our financial statements     note  summary of significant accounting policies   a basis of presentation   the consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap in the opinion of management all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations equity and cash flows are included   for the years ended december    and  certain entities or distinguishable components of rait have been presented as discontinued operations  see note  discontinued operations for further information  also during the year ended december   we began presenting property management expenses separately on the consolidated statements of operations  these expenses relate to employees that perform regional supervision accounting treasury human resources and other corporate functions  we have retroactively adjusted historical periods to reclassify these expenses from compensation expense and general and administrative expenses to property management expenses   b principles of consolidation   the consolidated financial statements reflect our accounts and the accounts of our majorityowned andor controlled subsidiaries we also consolidate entities that are variable interest entities or vies where we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of such entities the portions of these entities that we do not own are presented as noncontrolling interests as of the dates and for the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation   under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  “consolidation” the determination of whether to consolidate a vie is based on the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance together with either the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the vie we define the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance as the ability to buy sell refinance or recapitalize assets or entities and solely control other material operating events or items of the respective entity for our commercial mortgages mezzanine loans and preferred equity investments certain rights we hold are protective in nature and would preclude us from having the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance assuming both criteria are met we would be considered the primary beneficiary and would consolidate the  rait financial trust notes to consolidated financial statements as of december   dollars in thousands except share and per share amounts   vie we will continually assess our involvement with vies and consolidate the vies when we are the primary beneficiary during the second quarter of  we began presenting our floating rate securitizations as vies and corrected the prior period disclosure  in addition we began presenting assets and liabilities of consolidated vies in a parenthetical disclosure on the consolidated balance sheets  see note  for additional disclosures pertaining to vies   for entities that we do not consolidate we account for our investment in them either under the equity method pursuant to asc topic  “investmentsequity method and joint ventures” or cost method pursuant to asc topic  “investments – other”  during the year ended december   we wrote off  of our retail property management subsidiary’s investment in an entity because it no longer held the investment  the charge was reported in asset impairment in the consolidated statements of operations   c use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods the items that include significant estimates are fair value of financial instruments and allowance for loan losses actual results could differ from those estimates   d cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents include cash held in banks and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased cash including amounts restricted may at times exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation deposit insurance limit of  per institution we mitigate credit risk by placing cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions to date we have not experienced any losses on cash and cash equivalents   e restricted cash   restricted cash consists primarily of tenant escrows and borrowers’ funds held by us to fund certain expenditures or to be released at our discretion upon the occurrence of certain prespecified events and to serve as additional collateral for borrowers’ loans as of december   and  we had  and  respectively of tenant escrows and borrowers’ funds   restricted cash also includes proceeds from the issuance of cdo notes payable by securitizations that are restricted for the purpose of funding additional investments in securities subsequent to the balance sheet date as of december   and  we had  and  respectively of restricted cash held by securitizations   f investments in mortgages loans and preferred equity interests   we invest in commercial mortgages mezzanine loans and preferred equity interests we account for our investments in commercial mortgages mezzanine loans and preferred equity interests at amortized cost the carrying value of these investments is adjusted for origination discountspremiums nonrefundable fees and direct costs for originating loans which are amortized into income on a level yield basis over the terms of the loans   g allowance for loan losses impaired loans and nonaccrual status   we maintain an allowance for loan losses on our investments in commercial mortgages mezzanine loans and preferred equity interests management’s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based upon expected and inherent risks in the portfolio the estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic conditions the credit quality of our loans is monitored via quantitative and qualitative metrics  quantitatively we evaluate items such as the current debt service coverage ratio and annual net operating income of the underlying property  qualitatively we evaluate items such as recent operating performance of the underlying property and history of the borrower’s ability to provide financial support  these items together are considered in developing our view of each loan’s risk rating which are categorized as either impaired or satisfactory management reviews loans for impairment and establishes specific reserves when a loss is probable under the provisions of fasb asc topic  “receivables” a loan is impaired when it is probable that we may not collect all principal and interest payments according to the contractual terms as part of the detailed loan review we consider many factors about the specific loan including payment history asset performance borrower’s financial capability and other characteristics management evaluates loans for nonaccrual status each reporting period a loan is placed on nonaccrual status when the loan payment deficiencies exceed  days unless it is well secured and in the process of  rait financial trust notes to consolidated financial statements as of december   dollars in thousands except share and per share amounts   collection or if the collection of principal and interest in full is not probable payments received for nonaccrual or impaired loans are applied to principal until the loan is removed from nonaccrual status loans are generally removed from nonaccrual status when they are making current interest payments the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by chargeoffs net of recoveries we charge off a loan when we determine that all commercially reasonable means of recovering the loan balance have been exhausted  this may occur at a variety of times including when we receive cash or other assets in a preforeclosure sale or take control of the underlying collateral in full satisfaction of the loan upon foreclosure  we consider circumstances such as these to indicate that the loan collection process has ceased and that a loan is uncollectible    h investments in real estate   investments in real estate are shown net of accumulated depreciation we capitalize those costs that have been determined to improve the real property and depreciate those costs on a straightline basis over the useful life of the asset we depreciate real property using the following useful lives buildings and improvements— to  years furniture fixtures and equipment— to  years and tenant improvements—shorter of the lease term or the life of the asset costs for ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred   acquisitions of real estate assets and any related intangible assets are recorded initially at fair value under fasb asc topic  “business combinations” fair value is determined by management based on market conditions and inputs at the time the asset is acquired the fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets consisting of land building and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of the value of abovemarket and belowmarket leases for acquired inplace leases and the value of tenant relationships based in each case on their fair values purchase accounting is applied to assets and liabilities associated with the real estate acquired transaction costs and fees incurred related to acquisitions are expensed as incurred   upon the acquisition of properties we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building and improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases inplace leases and tenant relationships and assumed debt at the date of acquisition based on the evaluation of information and estimates available at that date in determining the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property abovemarket and belowmarket inplace lease values are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the differences between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the inplace leases and ii management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding inplace leases measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease the capitalized abovemarket lease values and the capitalized belowmarket lease values are amortized as an adjustment to rental income over the lease term   the aggregate value of inplace leases is determined by evaluating various factors including an estimate of carrying costs during the expected leaseup periods current market conditions and similar leases in estimating carrying costs management includes real estate taxes insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected leaseup periods based on current market demand management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions legal and other related costs the value assigned to this intangible asset is amortized over the assumed lease up period   management reviews our investments in real estate for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the review of recoverability is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the longlived asset’s use and eventual disposition these cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income trends and prospects as well as the effects of leasing demand competition and other factors if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a longlived asset an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property   i investments in securities    rait financial trust notes to consolidated financial statements as of december   dollars in thousands except share and per share amounts   we account for our investments in securities under fasb asc topic  “investments—debt and equity securities” and designate each investment security as a trading security an availableforsale security or a heldtomaturity security based on our intent at the time of acquisition trading securities are recorded at their fair value each reporting period with fluctuations in fair value reported as a component of earnings availableforsale securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss when we elect to record certain availableforsale securities under the fair value option in accordance with fasb asc topic  “financial instruments” they are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reported as a component of earnings see “m fair value of financial instruments” upon the sale of an availableforsale security the realized gain or loss on the sale will be recorded as a component of earnings in the respective period heldtomaturity investments are carried at amortized cost at each reporting period   we use our judgment to determine whether an investment in securities has sustained an otherthantemporary decline in value if management determines that an availableforsale security has sustained an otherthantemporary decline in its value the investment is written down to its fair value by a charge to earnings and we establish a new cost basis for the investment our evaluation of an otherthantemporary decline is dependent on the specific facts and circumstances factors that we consider in determining whether an otherthantemporary decline in value has occurred include the estimated fair value of the investment in relation to our cost basis the financial condition of the related entity and the intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the fair value of the investment   j transfers of financial assets   we account for transfers of financial assets under fasb asc topic  “transfers and servicing” as either sales or financings transfers of financial assets that result in sales accounting are those in which  the transfer legally isolates the transferred assets from the transferor  the transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the transferred assets and no condition both constrains the transferee’s right to pledge or exchange the assets and provides more than a trivial benefit to the transferor and  the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets if the transfer does not meet these criteria the transfer is accounted for as a financing financial assets that are treated as sales are removed from our accounts with any realized gain loss reflected in earnings during the period of sale financial assets that are treated as financings are maintained on the balance sheet with proceeds received from the legal transfer reflected as securitized borrowings or securityrelated receivables   k revenue recognition      interest income —we recognize interest income from investments in commercial mortgage loans mezzanine loans and preferred equity interests and other securities on a yield to maturity basis certain of our commercial mortgage loans mezzanine loans and preferred equity interests provide for the accrual of interest at specified rates which differ from current payment terms interest income is recognized on such loans the majority of which were originated prior to  at the accrual rate subject to management’s determination that accrued interest and outstanding principal are ultimately collectible management will cease accruing interest on these loans when it determines that the interest income is not collectible based on the value of the underlying collateral using discounted cash flow models and market based assumptions the accrued interest receivable associated with these loans as of december    and  was   and  respectively  these loans are considered to be impaired when the total amount owed exceeds the estimated value of the underlying collateral one of these loans with an unpaid principal balance of  was considered to be impaired as of december    none of these loans were considered to be impaired as of december   and    for investments that we do not elect to record at fair value under fasb asc topic  “financial instruments” origination fees and direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized to net investment income using the effective interest method over the contractual life of the underlying loan security or loan in accordance with fasb asc topic  “receivables”   for investments that we elect to record at fair value under fasb asc topic  origination fees and direct loan costs are recorded in income and are not deferred        property income —we generate rental income from tenant rent and other tenantrelated activities at our consolidated real estate properties for multifamily real estate properties property income is recorded when due from residents and  rait financial trust notes to consolidated financial statements as of december   dollars in thousands except share and per share amounts     recognized monthly as it is earned and realizable under lease terms which are generally for periods of one year or less for retail and office real estate properties property income is recognized on a straightline basis from the later of the date of the commencement of the lease or the date of acquisition of the property subject to existing leases which averages minimum rents over the terms of the leases for retail and office real estate properties leases also typically provide for tenant reimbursement of a portion of common area maintenance and other operating expenses to the extent that a tenant’s pro rata share of expenses exceeds a base year level set in the lease      fee and other income —we generate fee and other income through our various subsidiaries by a funding conduit loans for sale into unaffiliated commercial mortgagebacked securities or cmbs securitizations b providing or arranging to provide financing to our borrowers c providing ongoing asset management services to investment portfolios under cancelable management agreements and d providing property management services to third parties we recognize revenue for these activities when the fees are fixed or determinable are evidenced by an arrangement collection is reasonably assured and the services under the arrangement have been provided while we may receive asset management fees when they are earned we eliminate earned asset management fee income from securitizations while such securitizations are consolidated during the years ended december    and  we received   and  respectively of earned asset management fees we eliminated   and  respectively of these earned asset management fees as it was associated with consolidated securitizations   also during the years ended december    and  we earned   and  of asset management fees respectively and   and  of incentive fees respectively related to our advisory agreement with irt  during the years ended december    and  we also earned   and  respectively of property management and leasing fees related to our property management agreements with irt’s properties  as we consolidated irt through october   all of these fees earned for the years ended december   and  were eliminated in consolidation  for the year ended december    of asset management fees  of incentive fees and  of property management fees were eliminated in consolidation   l derivative instruments   we may use derivative financial instruments to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings  in accordance with fasb asc topic  “derivatives and hedging” we measure each derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts at fair value and record such amounts in our consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or liability for derivatives designated as fair value hedges derivatives not designated as hedges or for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges associated with debt for which we elected the fair value option under fasb asc topic  “financial instruments” the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument are recorded in earnings for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges the changes in the fair value of the effective portions of the derivative are reported in other comprehensive income changes in the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges if any are recognized in earnings   m fair value of financial instruments   in accordance with fasb asc topic  “fair value measurements and disclosures” fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date where available fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters where observable prices or inputs are not available valuation models are applied these valuation techniques involve management estimation and judgment the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments’ complexity for disclosure purposes assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value hierarchical levels as defined in fasb asc topic  “fair value measurements and disclosures” and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuations of these assets and liabilities are as follows     • level   valuations are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date the types of assets carried at level  fair value generally are equity securities listed in active markets as such valuations of these investments do not entail a significant degree of judgment    rait financial trust notes to consolidated financial statements as of december   dollars in thousands except share and per share amounts     • level   valuations are based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly fair value assets and liabilities that are generally included in this category are unsecured reit note receivables commercial mortgagebacked securities or cmbs receivables and certain financial instruments classified as derivatives where the fair value is based on observable market inputs     • level   inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability generally assets and liabilities carried at fair value and included in this category were trups and subordinated debentures trust preferred obligations and cdo notes payable where observable market inputs do not exist   the availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial asset or liability and is affected by a wide variety of factors including for example the type of investment whether the investment is new whether the investment is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market and the current market condition to the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market the determination of fair value requires more judgment accordingly the degree of judgment exercised by us in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level    fair value is a marketbased measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entityspecific measure therefore even when market assumptions are not readily available our own assumptions are set to reflect those that management believes market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date we use prices and inputs that management believes are current as of the measurement date including during periods of market dislocation in periods of market dislocation the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments this condition could cause an instrument to be transferred from level  to level  or level  to level    many financial instruments have bid and ask prices that can be observed in the marketplace bid prices reflect the highest price that buyers in the market are willing to pay for an asset ask prices represent the lowest price that sellers in the market are willing to accept for an asset for financial instruments whose inputs are based on bidask prices we do not require that fair value always be a predetermined point in the bidask range our policy is to allow for midmarket pricing and adjusting to the point within the bidask range that results in our best estimate of fair value   fair value for certain of our level  financial instruments is derived using internal valuation models these internal valuation models include discounted cash flow analyses developed by management using current interest rates estimates of the term of the particular instrument specific issuer information and other market data for securities without an active market in accordance with fasb asc topic  “fair value measurements and disclosures” the impact of our own credit spreads is also considered when measuring the fair value of financial assets or liabilities including derivative contracts where appropriate valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors including bidask spreads credit quality and market liquidity these adjustments are applied on a consistent basis and are based on observable inputs where available management’s estimate of fair value requires significant management judgment and is subject to a high degree of variability based upon market conditions the availability of specific issuer information and management’s assumptions   n income taxes   rait taberna realty finance trust or trft and irt have each elected to be taxed as a reit and to comply with the related provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended or the internal revenue code accordingly we generally will not be subject to us federal income tax to the extent of our dividends to shareholders and as long as certain asset income and share ownership tests are met if we were to fail to meet these requirements we would be subject to us federal income tax which could  rait financial trust notes to consolidated financial statements as of december   dollars in thousands except share and per share amounts   have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and amounts available for dividends to our shareholders management believes that all of the criteria to maintain rait’s trft’s and irt’s reit qualification have been met for the applicable periods but there can be no assurance that these criteria will continue to be met in subsequent periods   we maintain various taxable reit subsidiaries or trss which may be subject to us federal state and local income taxes and foreign taxes current and deferred taxes are provided on the portion of earnings losses recognized by us with respect to our interest in domestic trss deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed based on temporary differences between our gaap consolidated financial statements and the federal and state income tax basis of assets and liabilities as of the consolidated balance sheet date we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets eg net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and recognize a valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized when evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets we consider estimates of expected future taxable income existing and projected booktax differences tax planning strategies available and the general and industry specific economic outlook this realizability analysis is inherently subjective as it requires management to forecast our business and general economic environment in future periods changes in estimate of deferred tax asset realizability if any are included in income tax expense on the consolidated statements of operations   our trs entities generate taxable revenue primarily from i advisory fees for services provided to irt ii property management fees for services provided to rait properties irt properties and thirdparty properties and iii fees and other income from our cmbs lending business in consolidation the advisory fees and property management fees related to irt were eliminated through october   and property management fees related to rait properties were eliminated in their entirety nonetheless all income taxes are expensed and are paid by the trss in the year in which the revenue is received these income taxes are not eliminated when the related revenue is eliminated in consolidation   the trs entities may be subject to tax laws that are complex and potentially subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities in establishing a provision for income tax expense we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending upon changes in income tax laws actual results of operations and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed we review the tax balances of our trs entities quarterly and as new information becomes available the balances are adjusted as appropriate   o sharebased compensation   we account for our sharebased compensation in accordance with fasb asc topic  “compensationstock compensation” we measure the cost of employee and trustee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award and record compensation expense for the entire award on a straight line basis over the related vesting period for the entire award   p deferred financing costs   costs incurred in connection with debt financing are deferred and classified within indebtedness and charged to interest expense over the terms of the related debt agreements in a manner that approximates the effective interest method   q intangible assets   intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets represent identifiable intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions we amortize identified intangible assets to expense over their estimated lives using the straightline method we evaluate intangible assets for impairment as events and circumstances change in accordance with fasb asc topic  “property plant and equipment” the gross carrying amount for our customer relationships was  and  as of december   and december   respectively the gross carrying amount for our customer relationships has decreased as  of these assets became fully amortized during the year ended december    of which was due to the acceleration of amortization as a result of the cancellation of five customer relationships  the gross carrying amount for our inplace leases and abovemarket leases was  and  as of december   and december   respectively the gross carrying amount for urban retail’s trade name was  as of december   and december   the accumulated amortization for our intangible assets was  and  as of december   and december   respectively we recorded amortization expense of   and   for the years ended december    and  respectively based on the intangible assets  rait financial trust notes to consolidated financial statements as of december   dollars in thousands except share and per share amounts   identified above we expect to record amortization expense of intangible assets of  for   for   for   for   for  and  thereafter as of december    and  we have determined that no impairment exists on our intangible assets     q goodwill   goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet represented the amounts paid in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired from business acquisitions accounted for under fasb asc topic  “business combinations” pursuant to fasb asc topic  “intangiblesgoodwill and other” goodwill is not amortized to expense but rather is analyzed for impairment we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and as events and circumstances change in accordance with fasb asc topic  as of december   and  we have  and  respectively of goodwill that is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets during the year ended december   we derecognized  of goodwill related to the disposal of discontinued operations during the year ended december   we recorded an adjustment to correct the deferred tax liability balance with an offset to goodwill for  related to our acquisition of urban retail  during the year ended december   we revised the initial purchase price allocation related to urban retail and recorded a net increase in goodwill of  related to a deferred tax liability associated with definitelived intangible assets and an adjustment to a liability based on its fair value as of december    and  we have determined that no impairment exists on our goodwill   r recent accounting pronouncements   adopted within these financial statements   in

october  the fasb issued an accounting standard classified under fasb asc topic  “consolidation”  the amendments in this accounting standard provide guidance on how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a vie should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that vie  the amendments in this accounting standard do not change the characteristics of a primary beneficiary in current gaap  a primary beneficiary of a vie has both of the following characteristics i the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and ii the obligation to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie  if a reporting entity satisfies the first characteristic of a primary beneficiary such that it is the single decision maker of a vie the amendments in this accounting standard require that the reporting entity in determining whether it satisfies the second characteristic of a primary beneficiary to include all of its direct variable interest in a vie and on a proportionate basis its indirect variable interest in a vie held through related parties including related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity  if after performing that assessment a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a vie concludes that it does not have the characteristics of a primary beneficiary the amendments continue to require that the reporting entity evaluate whether it and one or more of its related parties under common control as a group have the characteristics of a primary beneficiary  the amendments in this accounting standard are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within

ifconverted method if the conversion value in excess of the par amount is considered in the money during the respective periods   according to fasb asc topic  “debt” we recorded a discount on our issued and outstanding  convertible senior notes of   this discount reflects the fair value of the embedded conversion option within the  convertible senior notes and was recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital the fair value was calculated by discounting the cash flows required in the indenture relating to the  convertible senior notes agreement by a discount rate that represents management’s estimate of our senior unsecured nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time when the  convertible senior notes were issued the discount will be amortized to interest expense through october   the date at which holders of our  convertible senior notes could require repayment   concurrent with the offering of the  convertible senior notes we used approximately  of the proceeds and entered into a capped call transaction with an affiliate of the underwriter the capped call transaction has a cap price of  which is subject to certain adjustments and an initial strike price of  which is subject to certain adjustments and is equivalent to the conversion price of the  convertible senior notes the capped calls expire on various dates ranging from june  to october  and are expected to reduce the potential dilution to holders of our common stock upon the potential conversion of the  convertible senior notes the capped call transaction is a separate transaction and is not part of the terms of the  convertible senior notes and will not affect the holders’ rights under the  convertible senior notes the capped call transaction meets the criteria for equity classification and was recorded as a reduction to additional paid in capital the capped call transaction is excluded from the dilutive eps calculation as their effect would be antidilutive   during the year ended

instruments we may use derivative financial instruments to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings the principal objective of such arrangements is to minimize the risks andor costs associated with our operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions while these instruments may impact our periodic cash flows they benefit us by minimizing the risks andor costs previously described the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions with which we and our affiliates may also have other financial relationships in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties we are potentially exposed to credit loss however because of the high credit ratings of the counterparties we do not anticipate that any of the counterparties will fail to meet their obligations interest rate derivatives we have entered into various interest rate swap contracts to hedge interest rate exposure on floating rate indebtedness       we designate interest rate hedge agreements at inception and determine whether or not the interest rate hedge agreement is highly effective in offsetting interest rate fluctuations associated with the identified indebtedness at designation certain of these interest rate swaps had a fair value not equal to zero however we concluded at designation that these hedging arrangements were highly effective during their term using regression analysis and determined that the hypothetical derivative method would be used in  rait financial trust notes to consolidated financial statements as of december   dollars in thousands except share and per share amounts   measuring any ineffectiveness at each reporting period we update our regression analysis and as of

  the accounting treatment for the series d preferred shares differs from the accounting treatment of our other preferred share instruments based on accounting standards the series d preferred shares were determined not to be classified as equity as they contain redemption features that are not solely in our control in addition the series d preferred shares were considered not to be classified as a liability because they are not mandatorily redeemable as a result the series d preferred shares are presented in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet between liabilities and equity any costs and the initial value of the warrants and investor sars are recorded as a discount on the series d preferred shares and that discount will be amortized to earnings over the respective term   the warrants and investor sars were both determined to be classified as liabilities and had a combined fair value of  as of december   the warrants contain a put feature which can only be settled by paying cash or issuing a note ie transferring assets this put feature is a distinguishing characteristic for liability classification the investor sars according to their terms can only be settled in cash or the issuance of a note payable to the investor this requirement for cash settlement is also a distinguishing characteristic for liability classification as a result the initial fair value of the warrants and investor sars are recorded as a liability and remeasured at each reporting period until the warrants and investor sars are settled changes in fair value will be recorded in earnings as a component of the change in fair value of financial instruments in the consolidated statement of operations   the following table summarizes the sales activity of the series d preferred shares

rait’s and the reit affiliates’ qualification and taxation as real estate investment trusts or reits and the acquisition holding and disposition of rait shares of beneficial interest for purposes of this exhibit we refer to “we” “us” and “our” refer to “rait” only and not its subsidiaries or other lowertier entities except as otherwise indicated this summary is based upon the internal revenue code of  as amended or the internal revenue code the treasury regulations current administrative interpretations and practices of the internal revenue service or the irs including administrative interpretations and practices expressed in private letter rulings which are binding on the irs only with respect to the particular taxpayers who requested and received those rulings and judicial decisions all as currently in effect and all of which are subject to differing interpretations or to change possibly with retroactive effect no assurance can be given that the irs would not assert or that a court would not sustain a position contrary to any of the tax consequences described below no advance ruling has been or will be sought from the irs regarding any matter discussed in this summary the summary is also based upon the assumption that the operation of the company and of its subsidiaries and other lowertier and affiliated entities will in each case be in accordance with its applicable organizational documents this summary is for general information only and does not purport to discuss all aspects of us federal income taxation that may be important to a particular shareholder in light of its investment or tax circumstances or to shareholders subject to special tax rules such as     •   us expatriates     •   persons who marktomarket our shares of beneficial interest     •   subchapter s corporations     •   us shareholders as defined below whose functional currency is not the us dollar     •   financial institutions     •   insurance companies     •   brokerdealers     •   regulated investment companies     •   trusts and estates     •   holders who receive our shares of beneficial interest through the exercise of employee shares options or otherwise as compensation     •   persons holding our shares of beneficial interest as part of a “straddle” “hedge” “conversion transaction” “synthetic security” or other integrated investment     •   persons subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the internal revenue code     •   persons holding our shares of beneficial interest through a partnership or similar passthrough entity     •   persons holding a  or more by vote or value beneficial interest in rait and except to the extent discussed below     •   taxexempt organizations and     •   nonus shareholders as defined below this summary assumes that shareholders will hold our shares of beneficial interest as capital assets which generally means as property held for investment the us federal income tax treatment of holders of our shares of beneficial interest depends in some instances on determinations of fact and interpretations of complex provisions of us federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available in addition the tax consequences of holding our shares of beneficial interest for any particular shareholder will depend on the shareholder’s particular tax circumstances you are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding the us federal state local and foreign income and other tax consequences to you in light of your particular investment or tax circumstances of acquiring holding and disposing of our shares of beneficial interest      taxation we elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code commencing with our taxable year ended december   our subsidiary taberna realty finance trust or trft elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code commencing with its taxable year ended december   we sponsored the initial public offering of independence realty trust inc or irt which is a publiclytraded reit irt elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code for its taxable year ended december   we refer to trft and irt together with any other reits we sponsor as the reit affiliates references to the reit affiliates mean only each such reit and not its subsidiaries or other lowertier entities except as otherwise indicated where any description is relevant exclusively to rait or one or more of our reit affiliates or applies differently to rait or one or more of our reit affiliates the name of the specific entity being described is used for purposes of such description we believe that each of rait and each reit affiliate have been organized and operated in a manner that will allow each of them to qualify for taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code and rait and the reit affiliates intend to continue to be organized and operated in such a manner while each of rait and the reit affiliates believes that it has been organized and operated so that it will qualify as a reit given the highly complex nature of the rules governing reits the ongoing importance of factual determinations and the possibility of future changes in rait’s or the reit affiliates’ circumstances applicable law or interpretations thereof no assurance can be given by rait or any reit affiliate that rait or any reit affiliate respectively will qualify as a reit for any particular year rait shareholders should be aware that the foregoing is not binding on the irs and no assurance can be given that the irs will not challenge the foregoing each of rait’s and each reit affiliate’s qualification and taxation as a reit depends on its separate ability to meet on a continuing basis through actual results of operations distribution levels and diversity of share ownership various qualification requirements imposed upon reits by the internal revenue code in addition rait’s and each reit affiliate’s ability to qualify as a reit may depend in part upon the operating results organizational structure and entity classification for us federal income tax purposes of certain entities in which rait and the reit affiliates invest which could include entities that have made elections to be taxed as reits rait’s and each reit affiliate’s ability to qualify as a reit also requires that rait and the reit affiliates satisfy certain asset and income tests some of which depend upon the fair market values of assets directly or indirectly owned by rait and the reit affiliates or which serve as security for loans made by rait and the reit affiliates such values may not be susceptible to a precise determination accordingly no assurance can be given that the actual results of rait’s and each reit affiliate’s operations for any taxable year will satisfy the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit in addition because of rait’s ownership of all of the common but not preferred equity of trft and because it is expected that rait will receive substantial dividend income from trft if trft fails to qualify as a reit it is very likely that rait will also fail to qualify as a reit similarly if rait owns a significant amount of the equity of any reit affiliate other than through a taxable reit subsidiary or trs and rait receives substantial dividend income from such reit affiliate if such reit affiliate fails to qualify as a reit it would adversely affect rait’s ability to qualify as a reit rait currently owns all of imt’s common equity directly and substantially all of irt’s common equity directly taxation of reits in general as indicated above qualification and taxation of each of rait and the reit affiliates as a reit depends upon rait’s and each reit affiliate’s ability to meet on a continuing basis various qualification requirements imposed upon reits by the internal revenue code the material qualification requirements are summarized below under “—requirements for qualification—general” while rait and the reit affiliates intend to operate so that each qualifies as a reit no assurance can be given that the irs will not challenge rait’s or the reit affiliates’ qualification as a reit or that rait or any reit affiliate will be able to operate in accordance with the reit requirements in the future see “—failure to qualify” in addition the failure of trft to qualify as a reit would very likely result in rait’s failure to qualify as a reit an entity that qualifies as a reit will generally be entitled to a deduction for dividends paid to its shareholders and therefore will not be subject to us federal corporate income tax on net taxable income that is currently distributed to its shareholders this treatment substantially eliminates the “double taxation” at the corporate and shareholder levels that results generally from investment in a corporation rather income generated by a reit generally is taxed only at the shareholder level upon a distribution of dividends by the reit us shareholders as defined below who are taxed at individual rates are generally taxed on corporate dividends at a maximum rate of  the same as longterm capital gains thereby substantially reducing though not completely eliminating the double taxation that has historically applied to corporate dividends with limited exceptions however dividends received by us shareholders who are taxed at individual rates from us or from other entities that are taxed as reits will continue to be taxed at rates applicable to ordinary income which are as high as  for  and subsequent years in addition both qualifying dividends and most reit dividends will be subject to the medicare surtax of  if modified adjusted gross income exceeds certain thresholds for example  if married and filing jointly net operating losses foreign tax credits and other tax attributes of a reit generally do not pass through to the shareholders of the reit subject to special rules for certain items such as capital gains recognized by reits see “—taxation of shareholders”    if we and the reit affiliates qualify as re its we and the reit affiliates will nonetheless be subject to us federal income tax in the following circumstances     •   each of rait and the reit affiliates will be taxed at regular corporate rates on any undistributed income including undistributed net capital gains     •   we and the reit affiliates may be subject to the “alternative minimum tax” on its items of tax preference if any     •   if we or the reit affiliates have net income from prohibited transactions which are in general sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business other than foreclosure property such income will be subject to a  tax see “—prohibited transactions” and “—foreclosure property” below     •   if we or the reit affiliates elect to treat property that we acquire in connection with a foreclosure of a mortgage loan or from certain leasehold terminations as “foreclosure property” we or the reit affiliates may thereby avoid a the  tax on gain from a resale of that property if the sale would otherwise constitute a prohibited transaction and b the inclusion of any income from such property not qualifying for purposes of the reit gross income tests discussed below but the income from the sale or operation of the property may be subject to corporate income tax at the highest applicable rate currently      •   if we or the reit affiliates fail to satisfy the  gross income test or the  gross income test as discussed below but our failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect and we or the reit affiliates as the case may be nonetheless maintain our or their reit qualification because other requirements are met we or the reit affiliates will be subject to a  tax on an amount equal to the greater of the amount by which we or the reit affiliates fail the  gross income test or the  gross income test as the case may be multiplied by b a fraction intended to reflect our or the reit affiliate’s profitability     •   if we or the reit affiliates fail to satisfy any of the reit asset tests as described below other than in the case of a de minimis failure of the  or  asset tests but such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect and we or the reit affiliates nonetheless maintain our or its reit qualification because of specified cure provisions we or the reit affiliates will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of  or the highest corporate tax rate currently  of the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets during the period in which we or the reit affiliates failed to satisfy the asset tests     •   if we or the reit affiliates fail to satisfy any provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our or its failure to qualify as a reit other than a gross income or asset test requirement and the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect we or the reit affiliates may retain our reit qualification but we or the reit affiliates will be required to pay a penalty of  for each such failure     •   if we or the reit affiliates fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of a  of our or its respective reit ordinary income for such year b  of our or the reit affiliates’ reit capital gain net income for such year and c any undistributed taxable income from prior periods or the “required distribution” we or the reit affiliates as the case may be will be subject to a  excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of  the amounts actually distributed taking into account excess distributions from prior years plus  retained amounts on which income tax is paid at the corporate level     •   we or the reit affiliates may be required to pay monetary penalties to the irs in certain circumstances including if we or the reit affiliates fail to meet recordkeeping requirements intended to monitor our and the reit affiliates’ compliance with rules relating to the composition of our and the reit affiliates’ shareholders as described below in “—requirements for qualification—general”     •   a  excise tax may be imposed on some items of income and expense that are directly or constructively paid between us and our trss and between trft and its trss as described below if and to the extent that the irs successfully adjusts the reported amounts of these items     •   if we or the reit affiliates acquire appreciated assets from a corporation that is not a reit in a transaction in which the adjusted tax basis of the assets in our or the reit affiliates’ hands is determined by reference to the adjusted tax basis of the assets in the hands of the nonreit corporation we or the reit affiliates as the case may be will be subject to tax on such appreciation at the highest corporate income tax rate then applicable if we subsequently recognize gain on a disposition of any such assets during the year period following their acquisition from the nonreit corporation the results described in this paragraph assume that the nonreit corporation will not elect in lieu of this treatment to be subject to an immediate tax when the asset is acquired by us or the reit affiliates     •   we will generally be subject to tax on the portion of any excess inclusion income derived from an investment by us or the reit affiliates in residual interests in real estate mortgage investment conduits or remics to the extent our shares are held in record name by specified taxexempt organizations not subject to tax on unrelated business taxable income or ubti similar rules apply if we or the reit affiliates own an equity interest in a taxable mortgage pool to the extent that we own a remic residual interest or a taxable mortgage pool through a trs we will not be subject to this tax for a discussion of “excess inclusion income” see “—effect of subsidiary entities — taxable mortgage pools” and “—excess inclusion income”        •   we may elect to retain and pay income tax on its net longterm capital gain in that case a shareholder would include its proportionate share of our undistributed longterm capital gain to the extent we make a timely designation of such gain to the shareholder in its income would be deemed to have paid the tax that we paid on such gain and would be allowed a credit for its proportionate share of the tax deemed to have been paid and an adjustment would be made to increase the shareholder’s basis in its             shares     •   we or the reit affiliates may have subsidiaries or own interests in other lowertier entities that are c corporations including our or the reit affiliates’ domestic trss the earnings of which will be subject to us federal corporate income tax     •   in addition we the reit affiliates and our subsidiaries may be subject to a variety of taxes other than us federal income tax including payroll taxes and state local and foreign income property and other taxes on assets income and operations as further described below rait jv trs sub llc rait sharpstown trs llc rait trs llc or rait trs taberna capital management llc or tcm rait funding llc or rait funding and other domestic trss will be subject to us federal corporate income tax on their taxable income we and the reit affiliates could also be subject to tax in situations and on transactions not presently contemplated requirements for qualification—general the internal revenue code defines a reit as a corporation trust or association  that is managed by one or more trustees or directors  the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest  that would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for the special internal revenue code provisions applicable to reits  that is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to specific provisions of the internal revenue code  the beneficial ownership of which is held by  or more persons  in which during the last half of each taxable year not more than  in value of the outstanding shares is owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer “individuals” as defined in the internal revenue code to include specified entities  which meets other tests described below including with respect to the nature of its income and assets and the amount of its distributions and  that makes an election to be a reit for the current taxable year or has made such an election for a previous taxable year that has not been terminated or revoked the internal revenue code provides that conditions  through  must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition  must be met during at least  days of a taxable year of  months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year conditions  and  do not need to be satisfied for the first taxable year for which an election to become a reit has been made our and the reit affiliates’ organizational documents provide restrictions regarding the ownership and transfer of shares which are intended to assist in satisfying the share ownership requirements described in conditions  and  above for purposes of condition  an “individual” generally includes a supplemental unemployment compensation benefit plan a private foundation or a portion of a trust permanently set aside or used exclusively for charitable purposes but does not include a qualified pension plan or profit sharing trust to monitor compliance with the share ownership requirements we and the reit affiliates are generally required to maintain records regarding the actual ownership of our and each of its shares to do so we and the reit affiliates must demand written statements each year from the record holders of significant percentages of our and the reit affiliates’ shares in which the record holders are to disclose the actual owners of the shares ie   the persons required to include in gross income the dividends paid by us a list of those persons failing or refusing to comply with this demand must be maintained as part of our and trft’s records failure by us or the reit affiliates to comply with these recordkeeping requirements could subject us or the reit affiliates to monetary penalties if we and the reit affiliates satisfy these requirements and have no reason to know that condition  is not satisfied we and the reit affiliates will be deemed to have satisfied such condition a shareholder that fails or refuses to comply with the demand is required by the treasury regulations to submit a statement with its tax return disclosing the actual ownership of the shares and other information in addition a corporation generally may not elect to become a reit unless its taxable year is the calendar year we and the reit affiliates satisfy this requirement effect of subsidiary entities ownership of partnership interests in the case of a reit that is a partner in a partnership the treasury regulations provide that the reit is deemed to own its proportionate share of the partnership’s assets and to earn its proportionate share of the partnership’s gross income based on its pro rata share of its capital interest in the partnership for purposes of the asset and gross income tests applicable to reits as described below however solely for purposes of the  value test described below the determination of a reit’s interest in partnership assets will be    based on the reit’s proportionate intere st in any securities issued by the partnership excluding for these purposes certain excluded securities as described in the internal revenue code in addition the assets and gross income of the partnership generally are deemed to retain the same charact er in the hands of the reit thus our and the reit affiliates’ proportionate shares of the assets and items of income of partnerships in which we or either of them own an equity interest are treated as assets and items of income for purposes of applying t he reit requirements described below consequently to the extent that we and the reit affiliates directly or indirectly hold a preferred or other equity interest in a partnership the partnership’s assets and operations may affect our or the reit affiliat es’ ability to qualify as a reit even though we and the reit affiliates may have no control or only limited influence over the partnership disregarded subsidiaries if a reit owns a corporate subsidiary that is a “qualified reit subsidiary” that subsidiary is disregarded for us federal income tax purposes and all assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit of the subsidiary are treated as assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit of the reit including for purposes of the gross income and asset tests applicable to reits as summarized below a qualified reit subsidiary is any corporation other than a trs that is wholly owned by a reit by other disregarded subsidiaries or by a combination of the two single member limited liability companies that are wholly owned by a reit are also generally disregarded as separate entities for us federal income tax purposes including for purposes of the reit gross income and asset tests disregarded subsidiaries along with partnerships in which a reit holds an equity interest are sometimes referred to herein as “passthrough subsidiaries” we expect that we and the reit affiliates will each hold assets and conduct operations in part through qualified reit subsidiaries and disregarded subsidiaries accordingly all assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit of each such subsidiary will be treated as assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit of ours or the reit affiliates’ as the case may be in the event that a disregarded subsidiary ceases to be wholly owned by us or the reit affiliates—for example if any equity interest in the subsidiary is acquired by a person other than us or the reit affiliates or another disregarded subsidiary of us or the reit affiliates—the subsidiary’s separate existence would no longer be disregarded for us federal income tax purposes instead it would have multiple owners and would be treated as either a partnership or a taxable corporation such an event could depending on the circumstances adversely affect our or the reit affiliates’ ability to satisfy the various asset and gross income tests applicable to reits including the requirement that reits generally may not own directly or indirectly more than  of the value or voting power of the outstanding securities of another corporation see “—asset tests” and “—gross income tests” taxable reit subsidiaries a reit may jointly elect with a nonreit subsidiary corporation whether or not wholly owned to treat the subsidiary corporation as a trs the separate existence of a trs or other taxable corporation unlike a disregarded subsidiary as discussed above is not ignored for us federal income tax purposes accordingly such an entity would generally be subject to corporate income tax on its earnings which may reduce the cash flow generated by us and our subsidiaries including trft in the aggregate and its ability to make distributions to its shareholders we have made a trs election with respect to tcm rait funding rait trs taberna equity funding ltd or tef and rait property management holdings llc in addition taberna funding capital trust i rait cmbs conduit i llc and rait cmbs conduit ii llc are subsidiaries of rait funding during  we restructured certain of our trss by moving tcm rait funding rait trs and rait property management holdings llc under a single trs holding company rait jv trs sub llc we also made a trs election for rait sharpstown trs llc we collectively refer to the trss listed above as the trss it is expected that we and the reit affiliates will make additional trs elections including with respect to future nonus entities that issue equity interests to us or the reit affiliates pursuant to collateralized debt obligation or cdo securitizations the internal revenue code and the treasury regulations provide a specific exemption from federal income tax to nonus corporations that restrict their activities in the united states to trading in shares and securities or any activity closely related thereto for their own account whether such trading or such other activity is conducted by the corporation or its employees through a resident broker commission agent custodian or other agent certain us shareholders as defined below of such a nonus corporation are required to include in their income currently their proportionate share of the earnings of such a corporation whether or not such earnings are distributed tef and certain additional cdo entities in which we and the reit affiliates may invest and with which we and the reit affiliates will jointly make a trs election will be organized as cayman islands companies and will either rely on such exemption or otherwise operate in a manner so that they will not be subject to federal income tax on their net income therefore despite such contemplated status of such cdo entities as trss we expect that such entities should generally not be subject to federal corporate income tax on their earnings however trft will be required to include in its income in certain cases even without the receipt of actual distributions on a current basis the earnings of such cdo entities this could affect trft’s and thus our ability to comply with the reit gross income tests and distribution requirement see “—gross income tests” and “—annual distribution requirements” a reit is not considered the owner of the assets of a trs or other subsidiary corporation or until dividends are paid by the trs to the reit the recipient of any income that a domestic trs earns rather the shares issued by the subsidiary are an asset in the hands of the reit and the reit generally recognizes as income the dividends if any that it receives from a domestic trs however we or the reit affiliates as the case may be will generally be required to include in income on a current basis the earnings of certain nonus trss including cdo entities as described in the preceding paragraph this treatment can affect the gross income and asset test calculations that apply to us or the reit affiliates as described below because a reit does not include the assets and in the case of a domestic trs income of such subsidiary corporations in determining the reit’s compliance with the reit requirements such entities may be used by a reit to undertake indirectly activities that the reit rules might otherwise preclude it from doing directly or through passthrough subsidiaries or render commercially unfeasible for example activities that give rise to certain categories of income such as nonqualifying hedging or prohibited transaction income if dividends are paid to us or the reit affiliates by one or more of our or its trss other than a nonus trs as described in the preceding paragraph then a portion of the dividends that we distribute to us individual shareholders generally will be eligible for taxation at preferential qualified dividend income tax rates rather than at ordinary income rates see “—taxation of shareholders—taxation of taxable us shareholders” and “—taxation of shareholders—distributions”    certain restrictions imposed on trss are intended to ensure that such entities will be subject to appropriate levels of us federal income taxation first a trs may not deduc t interest payments made in any year to an affiliated reit to the extent that such payments exceed generally  of the trs’s adjusted taxable income for that year although the trs may carry forward to and deduct in a succeeding year the disallowed in terest amount if the  test is satisfied in that year in addition if amounts are paid to a reit or deducted by a trs due to transactions between a reit its tenants andor a trs that exceed the amount that would be paid to or deducted by a party in a n arm’slength transaction the reit generally will be subject to an excise tax equal to  of such excess rents we or the reit affiliates receive that include amounts for services furnished by one of our or the reit affiliates’ trss to any of its tenan ts will not be subject to the excise tax if such amounts qualify for the safe harbor provisions contained in the internal revenue code safe harbor provisions are provided where  amounts are excluded from the definition of impermissible tenant service i ncome as a result of satisfying the  de minimis exception  a trs renders a significant amount of similar services to unrelated parties and the charges for such services are substantially comparable  rents paid to its reit shareholder from tenants that are not receiving services from the trs are substantially comparable to the rents paid by the reit’s tenants leasing comparable space that are receiving such services from the trs and the charge for the services is separately stated or  the trs’s gross income from the service is not less than  of the trs’s direct cost of furnishing the service to the extent that the trft trss or any additional trss we and the reit affiliates may form in the future pay any taxes they will have less cash available for distribution to trft or us if dividends are paid by a taxable domestic trs such as trft capital or rait funding to trft then the dividends we designate and pay to our shareholders who are individuals up to the amount of dividends we receive from such entities generally will be eligible to be taxed at the reduced  maximum us federal rate applicable to qualified dividend income see “—taxation of shareholders—taxation of taxable us shareholders” currently we anticipate that each of tcm and rait funding will retain its after tax income if any subject to compliance with the   for years beginning after december   asset test applicable to trft’s aggregate ownership of trss see “—asset tests” the shares that trft holds in tcm have a tax basis below the basis such shares would have had if trft purchased such shares at their agreed value in connection with the completion of its initial private placement of common shares and related transactions which we refer to as trft’s formation transactions if trft were to sell these shares the gain that it would recognize would be in excess of the amount of gain that would have been recognized had it purchased such shares in a taxable transaction accordingly such a sale could result in the generation of a significant amount of income that would not qualify for the reit  gross income test and an increased distribution requirement and accordingly could adversely affect trft’s ability to qualify as a reit see the discussion under “—gross income tests” and “—annual distribution requirements” in addition such a sale would result in a larger portion of rait’s dividend being subject to tax as a capital gain dividend as opposed to a return of capital taxable mortgage pools an entity or a portion of an entity may be classified as a taxable mortgage pool under the internal revenue code if     •   substantially all of its assets consist of debt obligations or interests in debt obligations     •   more than  of those debt obligations are real estate mortgage loans or interests in real estate mortgage loans as of specified testing dates     •   the entity has issued debt obligations that have two or more maturities and     •   the payments required to be made by the entity on its debt obligations “bear a relationship” to the payments to be received by the entity on the debt obligations that it holds as assets under the treasury regulations if less than  of the assets of an entity or a portion of an entity consist of debt obligations these debt obligations are considered not to comprise “substantially all” of its assets and therefore the entity would not be treated as a taxable mortgage pool trft’s past securitizations of mortgage loans are likely classified as taxable mortgage pool securitizations if we and the reit affiliates continue to make significant investments in mortgage loans commercial mortgage backed securities or cmbs or residential mortgage backed securities or rmbs we and the reit affiliates would likely continue to engage in securitization structures similar to these securitizations whereby we or the reit affiliates convey one or more pools of real estate mortgage loans to a trust which issues several classes of mortgagebacked bonds having different maturities and the cash flow on the real estate mortgage loans will be the sole source of payment of principal and interest on the several classes of mortgagebacked bonds as with trft’s historical securitizations neither we nor trft would likely make a remic election with respect to such securitization transactions and as a result each such similar transaction would also be a taxable mortgage pool securitization a taxable mortgage pool generally is treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes however special rules apply to a reit a portion of a reit or a qualified reit subsidiary that is a taxable mortgage pool if a reit owns directly or indirectly through one or more qualified reit subsidiaries or other entities that are disregarded as a separate entity for us federal income tax purposes  of the equity interest in the taxable mortgage pool the taxable mortgage pool will be a qualified reit subsidiary and therefore ignored as an entity separate from the parent reit for federal income tax purposes and would not generally affect the qualification of the reit rather the consequences of the taxable mortgage pool classification would generally except as described below be limited to the reit’s shareholders see “—excess inclusion income”    if we or the reit affiliates own less than  of the ownership interests in a subsidiary that is a taxable mortgage pool or fail to qualify as a reit the foregoing rules would not app ly rather the subsidiary would be treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes and would potentially be subject to corporate income tax in addition this characterization would alter our or the reit affiliates’ reit income and asset te st calculations and could adversely affect our or the reit affiliates’ compliance with those requirements we do not expect that we or the reit affiliates will form any subsidiary in which we or the reit affiliates own some but less than all of the owner ship interests that would become a taxable mortgage pool and we intend to monitor the structure of any taxable mortgage pools in which we or the reit affiliates have an interest to ensure that they will not adversely affect our or the reit affiliates’ rei t qualification gross income tests in order to maintain each of our and the reit affiliates’ qualification as reits each entity must satisfy two gross income tests annually first at least  of our and the reit affiliates’ gross income for each taxable year excluding gross income from “prohibited transactions” must be derived from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including “rents from real property” dividends received from other reits including in rait’s case dividends from trft provided trft qualifies as a reit interest income derived from mortgage loans secured by real property including certain types of mortgagebacked securities and gains from the sale of real estate assets as well as income from certain kinds of temporary investments second at least  of each of our and trft’s gross income in each taxable year excluding gross income from prohibited transactions must be derived from some combination of income that qualifies under the  gross income test described above as well as other dividends interest and gain from the sale or disposition of shares of beneficial interest or securities which need not have any relation to real property for purposes of the  and  gross income tests a reit is deemed to have earned a proportionate share of the income earned by any partnership or any limited liability company treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes in which it owns an interest which share is determined by reference to its capital interest in such entity and is deemed to have earned the income earned by any qualified reit subsidiary interest income  interest income constitutes qualifying mortgage interest for purposes of the  gross income test to the extent that the obligation is secured by a mortgage on real property in the case of real estate mortgage loans secured by both real and personal property if the fair market value of such personal property does not exceed  of the total fair market value of all property securing the loan then the personal property securing the loan will be treated as real property for purposes of determining whether the mortgage is qualifying under the  asset test and interest income that qualifies for purposes of the  gross income test we intend to invest funds not otherwise invested in real properties in cash sources or other liquid investments which will allow us to qualify under the  gross income test if a reit receives interest income with respect to a mortgage loan that is secured by both real property and other property and the highest principal amount of the loan outstanding during a taxable year exceeds the fair market value of the real property determined as of  the date such reit acquired or originated the mortgage loan or  as discussed further below in the event of a “significant modification” the date we modified the loan the interest income will be apportioned between the real property and the other property and its income from the loan will qualify for purposes of the  gross income test only to the extent that the interest is allocable to the real property even if a loan is not secured by real property or is undersecured the income that it generates may nonetheless qualify for purposes of the  gross income test many of the terms of our mortgage loans and mezzanine loans have been modified and may in the future be modified under the internal revenue code if the terms of a loan are modified in a manner constituting a “significant modification” such modification triggers a deemed exchange of the original loan for the modified loan revenue procedure  as modified and superseded by revenue procedure  provides a safe harbor pursuant to which we will not be required to redetermine the fair market value of the real property securing a loan for purposes of the gross income and asset tests in connection with a loan modification that is  occasioned by a borrower default or  made at a time when we reasonably believe that the modification to the loan will substantially reduce a significant risk of default on the original loan no assurance can be provided all of our loan modifications have or will qualify for the safe harbor in revenue procedure  as modified and superseded by revenue procedure  to the extent we significantly modify loans in a manner that does not qualify for that safe harbor we will be required to redetermine the value of the real property securing the loan at the time it was significantly modified in determining the value of the real property securing such a loan we generally will not obtain thirdparty appraisals but rather will rely on internal valuations no assurance can be provided that the irs will not successfully challenge our internal valuations if the terms of our mortgage loans mezzanine loans and subordinated mortgage interests and loans supporting our mortgagebacked securities are significantly modified in a manner that does not qualify for the safe harbor in revenue procedure  as modified and superseded by revenue procedure  and the fair market value of the real property securing such loans has decreased significantly we could fail the  gross income test the  asset test andor the  value test to the extent that the terms of a loan provide for contingent interest that is based on the cash proceeds realized upon the sale of the property securing the loan a “shared appreciation provision” income attributable to the participation feature will be treated as gain from sale of the underlying property which generally will be qualifying income for purposes of both the  and  gross income tests provided that the property is not inventory or dealer property in the hands of the borrower or the lender to the extent that a reit derives interest income from a loan where all or a portion of the amount of interest payable is contingent such income generally will qualify for purposes of the gross income tests only if it is based upon the gross receipts or sales and not the net income or profits of any person this limitation does not apply however to a mortgage loan where the borrower derives substantially all of its income from the property from the leasing of substantially all of its interest in the property to tenants to the extent that the rental income derived by the borrower would qualify as rents from real property had it been earned directly by the lender    any amount includible in a reit’s gross income with respect to a regular or residual interest in a remi c generally is treated as interest on an obligation secured by a mortgage on real property if however less than  of the assets of a remic consists of real estate assets determined as if such reit held such assets such reit will be treated as recei ving directly its proportionate share of the income of the remic among the assets that we hold are mezzanine loans secured by equity interests in a passthrough entity that directly or indirectly owns real property rather than a direct mortgage on the real property irs revenue procedure  provides a safe harbor pursuant to which a mezzanine loan if it meets each of the requirements contained in the revenue procedure will be treated by the irs as a real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests and interest derived from it will be treated as qualifying real estate income for purposes of the  gross income test although the revenue procedure provides a safe harbor on which taxpayers may rely it does not prescribe rules of substantive tax law moreover the mezzanine loans that we hold and that we may acquire in the future do not and may not meet all of the requirements for reliance on this safe harbor hence there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge the qualification of our mezzanine loans as real estate assets or the interest generated by these loans as qualifying income under the  gross income test to the extent we make corporate mezzanine loans such loans will not qualify as real estate assets and interest income with respect to such loans will not be qualifying income for the  gross income test we believe that the interest original issue discount and market discount income that we and the reit affiliates receive from mortgagerelated securities generally will be qualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests however to the extent that we or the reit affiliates own nonremic collateralized mortgage obligations or other debt instruments secured by mortgage loans rather than by real property or secured by nonreal estate assets or debt securities that are not secured by mortgages on real property or interests in real property the interest income received with respect to such securities generally will be qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test but not the  gross income test in addition the loan amount of a mortgage loan that we or the reit affiliates own may exceed the value of the real property securing the loan in that case a portion of the income from the loan will be qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test but not the  gross income test dividend income we and the reit affiliates may receive distributions from trss or other corporations that are not reits or qualified reit subsidiaries these distributions will generally be classified as dividend income to the extent of the earnings and profits of the distributing corporation such distributions will generally constitute qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test but not the  gross income test any dividends received by us or the reit affiliates from a reit including dividends rait receives from trft and irt provided trft and irt qualify as reits will be qualifying income for purposes of both the  and  gross income tests we and the reit affiliates likely will be required to include in its income even without the receipt of actual distributions earnings from its foreign trss which are cdos we and the reit affiliates treat certain of these income inclusions as qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test but not the  gross income test the provisions that set forth what income is qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test provide that gross income derived from dividends interest and certain other enumerated classes of passive income qualify for purposes of the  gross income test income inclusions from equity investments in foreign trss which are cdos are technically neither dividends nor any of the other enumerated categories of income specified in the  gross income test for us federal income tax purposes and there is no other clear precedent with respect to the qualification of such income however based on advice of counsel we and the reit affiliates treat such income inclusions to the extent distributed by a foreign trs which are cdos in the year accrued as qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test in  the irs issued two private letter rulings considering situations in which a reit had to include income from foreign corporations the irs ruled that such income would qualify for the  gross income test since private letter rulings only protect the recipient of the letter it is still possible that because this income does not meet the literal requirements of the reit provisions the irs could successfully take the position that such income is not qualifying income in the event that such income was determined not to qualify for the  gross income test we and the reit affiliates would be subject to a penalty tax with respect to such income to the extent it and other nonqualifying income exceeds  of gross income andor we or the reit affiliates could fail to qualify as a reit in addition if such income was determined not to qualify for the  gross income test we or the reit affiliates would need to invest in sufficient qualifying assets or sell some interests in foreign trss which are cdos to ensure that the income recognized from foreign trss which are cdos or such other corporations does not exceed  of gross income or cease to qualify as a reit see “—failure to satisfy the gross income tests” hedging transactions we and the reit affiliates may enter into hedging transactions with respect to one or more of our assets or liabilities hedging transactions could take a variety of forms including interest rate swaps or cap agreements options futures contracts forward rate agreements or similar financial instruments except to the extent provided by the treasury regulations any income from a hedging transaction we enter into in the normal course of its business primarily to manage risk of interest rate or price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made or ordinary obligations incurred or to be incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets which is clearly identified as specified in the treasury regulations before the close of the day on which it was acquired originated or entered into including gain from the sale or disposition of such a transaction will not constitute gross income for purposes of the  gross income test but will not constitute nonqualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test in addition if we entered into a hedging transaction i to manage the risk of interest rate price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made or ii to manage the risk of currency fluctuations and a portion of the hedged indebtedness or property is disposed of and in connection with such extinguishment or disposition we enter into a new clearly identified hedging transaction a “counteracting hedge” income from the applicable hedge and income from the counteracting hedge including gain from the disposition of such counteracting hedge will not be treated as gross income for purposes of the  and  gross income tests to the extent that we or the reit affiliates enter into other types of hedging transactions the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests we and the reit affiliates’ intend to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that does not jeopardize our or the reit affiliates’ qualification as a reit    rents from real property to the extent th at a reit owns real property or interests therein rents it receives will qualify as “rents from real property” in satisfying the gross income tests described above only if several conditions are met including the following if rent attributable to person al property leased in connection with real property is greater than  of the total rent received under any particular lease then all of the rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as rents from real property the determination of wh ether an item of personal property constitutes real or personal property under the reit provisions of the internal revenue code is subject to both legal and factual considerations and is therefore subject to different interpretations in addition in order for rents received by a reit to qualify as “rents from real property” the rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person however an amount will not be excluded from rents from real property solely by being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of sales or if it is based on the net income of a tenant which derives substantially all of its income with respect to such property from subleasing of substantially all of such property to the extent that the rents paid by the subtenants would qualify as rents from real property if earned directly by the reit moreover for rents received to qualify as “rents from real property” a reit generally must not operate or manage the property or furnish or render certain services to the tenants of such property other than through an “independent contractor” who is adequately compensated and from which we derive no income or through a trs as discussed below a reit is permitted however to perform services that are “usually or customarily rendered” in connection with the rental of space for occupancy only and are not otherwise considered rendered to the occupant of the property in addition a reit may directly or indirectly provide noncustomary services to tenants of its properties without disqualifying all of the rent from the property if the payment for such services does not exceed  of the total gross income from the property in such a case only the amounts for noncustomary services are not treated as rents from real property and the provision of the services does not disqualify the related rent moreover a reit is permitted to provide services to tenants through a trs without disqualifying the rental income received from tenants for purposes of the reit gross income tests rental income will qualify as rents from real property only to the extent that we a reit does not directly or constructively own  in the case of any tenant which is a corporation shares of beneficial interest possessing  or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of shares entitled to vote or  or more of the total value of shares of all classes of shares of such tenant or  in the case of any tenant which is not a corporation an interest of  or more in the assets or net profits of such tenant however rental payments from a trs will qualify as rents from real property even if a reit owns more than  of the combined voting power of the trs if at least  of the property is leased to unrelated tenants and the rent paid by the trs is substantially comparable to the rent paid by the unrelated tenants for comparable space failure to satisfy the gross income tests we intend to monitor our and the reit affiliates’ sources of income including any nonqualifying income received by us or the reit affiliates so as to ensure our and the reit affiliates’ compliance with the gross income tests if we or the reit affiliates fail to satisfy one or both of the  or  gross income tests for any taxable year we or the reit affiliates as the case may be may still qualify as a reit for the year if entitled to relief under applicable provisions of the internal revenue code these relief provisions will generally be available if the failure to meet these tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect and following the identification of such failure we or the reit affiliates set forth a description of each item of our or the reit affiliates’ gross income that satisfies the gross income tests in a schedule for the taxable year filed in accordance with the treasury regulations it is not possible to state whether we or the reit affiliates would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions in all circumstances if these relief provisions are inapplicable to a particular set of circumstances we or the reit affiliates will not qualify as a reit as discussed above under “—taxation of reits in general” even where these relief provisions apply a tax would be imposed upon the profit attributable to the amount by which we or the reit affiliates fail to satisfy the particular gross income test multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our or its profitability if the irs were to determine that trft failed the  gross income test because income inclusions with respect to its equity investments in foreign cdo trss that were distributed by the foreign cdo trss during the year such income was accrued are not qualifying income it is possible that the irs would not consider trft’s position taken with respect to such income and accordingly its failure to satisfy the  gross income test to be considered to be due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect if the irs were to successfully assert this position trft and therefore very likely rait would fail to qualify as a reit see “failure to qualify” asset tests a reit at the close of each calendar quarter must also satisfy four tests relating to the nature of its assets first at least  of the value of the reit’s total assets must be represented by some combination of “real estate assets” cash cash items us government securities debt instruments issued by publicly offered reits limited to  of our assets if not secured by real estate assets personal property leased in connection with real property to the extent that rents attributable to such personal property are treated as “rents from real property” and under some circumstances shares or debt instruments purchased with new capital for this purpose real estate assets include interests in real property such as land buildings leasehold interests in real property shares of other corporations that qualify as reits including trft shares owned by rait provided trft qualifies as a reit and certain kinds of mortgagebacked securities and mortgage loans assets that do not qualify for purposes of the  test are subject to the additional asset tests described below second the value of any one issuer’s securities owned by the reit may not exceed  of the value of the reit’s gross assets third the reit may not own more than  of any one issuer’s outstanding securities as measured by either voting power or value fourth the aggregate value of all securities of trss held by a reit may not exceed   for years beginning after december   of the value of such reit’s gross assets      the  and  asset tests do not apply to securities of trss and qualified reit subsidiaries the  value test does not apply to certain “straight debt” and other excluded securities as desc ribed in the internal revenue code including but not limited to any loan to an individual or an estate any obligation to pay rents from real property and any security issued by a reit in addition a a reit’s interest as a partner in a partnership is n ot considered a security for purposes of applying the  value test b any debt instrument issued by a partnership other than straight debt or other excluded security will not be considered a security issued by the partnership if at least  of the p artnership’s gross income is derived from sources that would qualify for the  reit gross income test and c any debt instrument issued by a partnership other than straight debt or other excluded security will not be considered a security issued by t he partnership to the extent of the reit’s interest as a partner in the partnership for purposes of the  value test “straight debt” means a written unconditional promise to pay on demand on a specified date a sum certain in money if i the debt is not convertible directly or indirectly into shares ii the interest rate and interest payment dates are not contingent on profits the borrower’s discretion or similar factors other than certain contingencies relating to the timing and amount of principal and interest payments as described in the internal revenue code and iii in the case of an issuer which is a corporation or a partnership securities that otherwise would be considered straight debt will not be so considered if the reit and any of its “controlled trss” as defined in the internal revenue code hold any securities of the corporate or partnership issuer which a are not straight debt or other excluded securities prior to the application of this rule and b have an aggregate value greater than  of the issuer’s outstanding securities including for the purposes of a partnership issuer the reit’s interest as a partner in the partnership after initially meeting the asset tests at the close of any quarter a reit will not lose its qualification as such for failure to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a later quarter solely by reason of changes in asset values if a reit fails to satisfy the asset tests because it acquires securities during a quarter it can cure this failure by disposing of sufficient nonqualifying assets within  days after the close of that quarter if a reit fails the  asset test or the  vote or value asset tests at the end of any quarter and such failure is not cured within  days thereafter the reit may dispose of sufficient assets generally within six months after the last day of the quarter in which such reit’s identification of the failure to satisfy these asset tests occurred to cure such a violation that does not exceed the lesser of  of its assets at the end of the relevant quarter or  if a reit fails any of the other asset tests or its failure of the  and  asset tests is in excess of the de minimis amount described above as long as such failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect the reit is permitted to avoid disqualification as a reit after the  day cure period by taking steps including the disposition of sufficient assets to meet the asset test generally within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the identification of the failure to satisfy the reit asset test occurred and paying a tax equal to the greater of  or the highest corporate income tax rate currently  of the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets during the period in which the reit fails to satisfy the asset test based on the current value of our investment in irt we believe that our status as a reit would not be jeopardized even if irt failed to qualify as a reit because such failure would result only our failing to satisfy the  asset tests by a de minimis amount we expect that the assets and mortgagerelated securities that we and the reit affiliates own generally will be qualifying assets for purposes of the  asset test however to the extent that we or the reit affiliates own nonremic collateralized mortgage obligations or other debt instruments secured by mortgage loans rather than by real property or secured by nonreal estate assets or debt securities issued by corporations that are not secured by mortgages on real property those securities may not be qualifying assets for purposes of the  asset test in addition to the extent we or the reit affiliates own the equity of a trups securitization and do not make a trs election with respect to such entity we or the reit affiliates as the case may be will be deemed to own such trups which will not be a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the  asset test described above we believe that our or the reit affiliates’ holdings of securities and other assets will be structured in a manner that will comply with the foregoing reit asset requirements and intend to monitor compliance on an ongoing basis moreover values of some assets may not be susceptible to a precise determination and are subject to change in the future furthermore the proper classification of an instrument as debt or equity for us federal income tax purposes may be uncertain in some circumstances which could affect the application of the reit asset tests as an example if we or the reit affiliates were to make an investment in preferred securities or other equity securities of a reit issuer that were determined by the irs to represent debt securities of such issuer such securities would also not qualify as real estate assets accordingly there can be no assurance that the irs will not contend that interests in subsidiaries or in the securities of other issuers including reit issuers cause a violation of the reit asset tests we have acquired and we and the reit affiliates may acquire mezzanine loans which are loans secured by equity interests in a partnership or limited liability company that directly or indirectly owns real property in revenue procedure  the irs provided a safe harbor pursuant to which a mezzanine loan if it meets each of the requirements contained in the revenue procedure will be treated by the irs as a real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests and interest derived from the mezzanine loan will be treated as qualifying real estate income for purposes of the reit  income test although the revenue procedure provides a safe harbor on which taxpayers may rely it does not prescribe rules of substantive tax law rait has acquired and we and the reit affiliates may acquire mezzanine loans that may not meet all of the requirements for reliance on this safe harbor in the event we or the reit affiliates own a mezzanine loan that does not meet the safe harbor the irs could challenge such loan’s treatment as a real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset and income tests and if such a challenge were sustained we or the reit affiliates could fail to qualify as a reit   we and trft have entered into and we and the reit affiliates may enter into sale and repurchase agreements under which we and the reit affiliates nominally sell certain of their mortgage assets to a counterparty and simultaneously enter into an agreement to repurchase the sold assets we and the reit affiliates believe that they have been and will be treated for us federal income tax purposes as the owner of the mortgage assets that are the subject of any such agreement notwithstanding that they may transfer record ownership of the assets to the counterparty during the term of the agreement it is possible however that the irs could assert that we or the reit affiliates did not own the mortgage assets during the term of the sale and repurchase agreement in which case our or the reit affiliates’ ability to qualify as a reit would be adversely affected    annual distribution requirements in order to qualify as reits we and the reit affiliates are required to make distributions other than capital gain dividends to our respective shareholders principally us in the case of trft in an amount at least equal to a the sum of     •    of our “reit taxable income” computed without regard to its deduction for dividends paid and our net capital gains and     •    of the net income after tax if any from foreclosure property as described below minus b the sum of specified items of noncash income that exceeds a percentage of its income these distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate or in the following taxable year if such distributions are declared in october november or december of the taxable year are payable to shareholders of record on a specified date in any such month and are actually paid before the end of january of the following year such distributions are treated as both paid by us and received by each shareholder on december  of the year in which they are declared in addition at its election a distribution for a taxable year may be declared before a reit timely files its tax return for the year and be paid with or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration provided that such payment is made during the month period following the close of such taxable year these distributions are taxable to the reit’s shareholders in the year in which paid even though the distributions relate to its prior taxable year for purposes of the  distribution requirement in order for distributions to be counted towards our distribution requirement and to provide us with a tax deduction for years prior to  they must not be “preferential dividends” a dividend is not a preferential dividend if it is pro rata among all outstanding shares within a particular class and is in accordance with the preferences among different classes of shares as set forth in our organizational documents to the extent that we or the reit affiliates distribute at least  but less than  of our or its “reit taxable income” as adjusted we or it as the case may be will be subject to tax at ordinary corporate tax rates on the retained portion in addition we or the reit affiliates may elect to retain rather than distribute our or its net longterm capital gains and pay tax on such gains in this case we or the reit affiliates as the case may be could elect to have our or its shareholders include their proportionate share of such undistributed longterm capital gains in income and receive a corresponding credit for their proportionate share of the tax paid by us or the reit affiliates our or the reit affiliates’ shareholders would then increase the adjusted basis of their shares of beneficial interest in us or the reit affiliates by the difference between the designated amounts included in their longterm capital gains and the tax deemed paid with respect to their proportionate shares if we or the reit affiliates fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of a  of our reit ordinary income for such year b  of our or its reit capital gain net income for such year and c any undistributed taxable income from prior periods we or the reit affiliates as the case may be will be subject to a  excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the sum of x the amounts actually distributed taking into account excess distributions from prior periods and y the amounts of income retained on which we or the reit affiliates as the case may be have paid corporate income tax we intend to make and to have the reit affiliates make timely distributions so that we and the reit affiliates are not subject to the  excise tax     it is possible that we or the reit affiliates from time to time may not have sufficient cash to meet the distribution requirements due to timing differences between a the actual receipt of cash including receipt of distributions from our or the reit affiliates’ subsidiaries and b the inclusion of items in income by us or the reit affiliates for us federal income tax purposes including the inclusion of items of income from cdo entities in which we or the reit affiliates as the case may be hold an equity interest see “—effect of subsidiary entities—taxable reit subsidiaries” in the event that such timing differences occur in order to meet the distribution requirements it might be necessary to arrange for shortterm or possibly longterm borrowings or to pay dividends in the form of taxable inkind distributions of property a reit is also treated as having paid a dividend if it and its shareholders elect to treat certain amounts as distributed although no actual distribution is made the election may be filed at any time not later than the date including extensions of the reit’s income tax return for the taxable year for which the dividend paid deduction is claimed trft used this “consent dividend” election to comply with its distribution requirement for  and may do so in  and subsequent years it and we as the holder of all of the common shares of trft filed such an election with trft’s  tax returns and intend to do so for  as a result we had dividend income from trft for  in amounts equal to such consent dividends we believe we have distributed to our shareholders sufficient dividends for  so that we were in compliance with our distribution requirements even after including the consent dividends from trft in our income we or the reit affiliates may be able to rectify a failure to meet the distribution requirements for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to shareholders in a later year which may be included in our or the reit affiliates’ deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year in this case we or the reit affiliates as the case may be may be able to avoid losing our or its qualification as a reit or being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends however we or the reit affiliates as the case may be will be required to pay interest and a penalty based on the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividends    excess inclusion income if we or the reit affiliates own a residual interest in a remic we or the reit affiliates may realize excess inclusion income if we or the reit affiliates are deemed to have issued debt obligations having two or more maturities the payments on which correspond to payments on mortgage loans owned by us or the reit affiliates such arrangement will be treated as a taxable mortgage pool for us federal income tax purposes see “—effect of subsidiary entities—taxable mortgage pools” if all or a portion of us or the reit affiliates is treated as a taxable mortgage pool our or the reit affiliates’ qualification as a reit generally should not be impaired neither we nor trft have ever had any excess inclusion income and we intend to manage our investments and take all necessary steps to prevent us from having excess inclusion income in the future prohibited transactions net income derived from a prohibited transaction is subject to a  tax the term “prohibited transaction” generally includes a sale or other disposition of property other than foreclosure property that is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business by a reit by a passthrough entity in which the reit holds an equity interest or by a borrower that has issued a shared appreciation mortgage or similar debt instrument to the reit we intend to conduct our operations so that no asset owned by us the reit affiliates or our passthrough subsidiaries will be held as inventory or for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business however whether property is held “for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business” depends on the particular facts and circumstances no assurance can be given that any particular property in which we or the reit affiliates hold a direct or indirect interest will not be treated as property held for sale to customers or that certain safeharbor provisions of the internal revenue code that prevent such treatment will apply the  tax will not apply to gains from the sale of property by a trs or other taxable corporation although such income will be subject to tax in the hands of the corporation at regular us federal corporate income tax rates foreclosure property foreclosure property is real property and any personal property incident to such real property  that is acquired by a reit as a result of the reit having bid on the property at foreclosure or having otherwise reduced the property to ownership or possession by agreement or process of law after there was a default or default was imminent on a lease of the property or a mortgage loan held by the reit and secured by the property  for which the related loan or lease was acquired by the reit at a time when default was not imminent or anticipated and  for which such reit makes a proper election to treat the property as foreclosure property reits generally are subject to tax at the maximum corporate rate currently  on any net income from foreclosure property including any gain from the disposition of the foreclosure property other than income that would otherwise be qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test any gain from the sale of property for which a foreclosure property election has been made will not be subject to the  tax on gains from prohibited transactions described above even if the property would otherwise constitute inventory or property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business in the hands of the selling reit we do not anticipate that we or the reit affiliates will receive any income from foreclosure property that is not qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test but if we or the reit affiliates do receive any such income we intend to elect or to have trft elect to treat the related property as foreclosure property failure to qualify in the event that we or the reit affiliates violate a provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our or its failure to qualify as a reit specified relief provisions will be available to us or the reit affiliates to avoid such disqualification if  the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect  we or the reit affiliates pay a penalty of  for each failure to satisfy the provision and  the violation does not include a violation under the gross income or asset tests described above for which other specified relief provisions are available this cure provision reduces the instances that could lead to our or the reit affiliates’ disqualification as a reit for violations due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect if we or the reit affiliates fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and none of the relief provisions of the internal revenue code apply we or the reit affiliates will be subject to tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our or the reit affiliates’ taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to our shareholders in any year in which we are not a reit will not be deductible by us or the reit affiliates nor will they be required to be made in this situation to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits and subject to limitations of the internal revenue code distributions to our or the reit affiliates’ shareholders will generally be taxable in the case of our shareholders who are individual us shareholders as defined below at a maximum rate of  and depending on the individual’s modified adjusted gross income possibly an additional medicare surtax of  for  and subsequent taxable years and dividends in the hands of our corporate us shareholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction in addition our or the reit affiliates’ taxable mortgage pool securitizations will be treated as separate taxable corporations for us federal income tax purposes unless we are entitled to relief under the specific statutory provisions we or the reit affiliates will also be disqualified from reelecting to be taxed as a reit for the four taxable years following a year during which qualification was lost it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we or the reit affiliates will be entitled to statutory relief use of net operating loss carryovers we have net operating loss carryovers that we have used and may use in the future to reduce reit taxable income thereby reducing our distribution requirement under section  of the code if there has been a more than fifty percent change in ownership of the equity of a corporation including a reit the ability to use net operating losses incurred prior to the change in ownership will be limited if it is determined that a requisite ownership change has occurred and we have used our net operating losses to reduce our distribution for any postchange year we would have to pay a deficiency dividend and an interest charge to satisfy the distribution requirement for any such year    taxation of shareholders taxation of taxable us shareholders this section summarizes the taxation of us shareholders that are not taxexempt organizations for these purposes a us shareholder is a beneficial owner of either our shares of beneficial interest that for us federal income tax purposes is     •   a citizen or resident of the united states     •   a corporation including an entity treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the united states or of a political subdivision thereof including the district of columbia     •   an estate whose income is subject to us federal income taxation regardless of its source or     •   any trust if  a us court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more us persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or  it has a valid election in place to be treated as a us person if an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes holds our shares of beneficial interest the us federal income tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership a partner of a partnership holding our shares of beneficial interest should consult its tax advisor regarding the us federal income tax consequences to the partner of the acquisition ownership and disposition of our shares of beneficial interest by the partnership for taxable years beginning after december   certain us shareholders who are individuals estates or trusts and whose income exceeds certain thresholds are required to pay a  medicare tax the medicare tax applies to among other things dividends and other income derived from certain trades or business and net gains from the sale or other disposition of property subject to certain exceptions our dividends generally will be subject to the medicare tax if certain disclosure requirements related to us accounts are not satisfied us shareholders that hold our shares of beneficial interest through foreign accounts or intermediaries will be subject to us federal withholding tax at a rate of  on dividends paid after june   subject to a “transition period” applicable through the end of  with respect to which the irs will take into account certain good faith compliance efforts and proceeds of sale of our stock paid after december   distributions provided that we qualify as a reit distributions made to our taxable us shareholders out of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and not designated as capital gain dividends will generally be taken into account by them as ordinary dividend income and will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction generally available to corporate us shareholders in determining the extent to which a distribution with respect to our shares of beneficial interest constitutes a dividend for us federal income tax purposes our earnings and profits will be allocated first to distributions with respect to our preferred shares of beneficial interest and then to our common shares dividends received from reits generally are not eligible to be taxed at the preferential qualified dividend income rates applicable to individual us shareholders who receive dividends from regular corporations in addition distributions from us that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed to us shareholders as longterm capital gains to the extent that they do not exceed the actual net capital gain of us for the taxable year without regard to the period for which the us shareholder has held its shares to the extent that we elect under the applicable provisions of the internal revenue code to retain our net capital gains us shareholders will be treated as having received for us federal income tax purposes our undistributed capital gains as well as a corresponding credit for taxes paid by us on such retained capital gains us shareholders will increase their adjusted tax basis in our shares of beneficial interest by the difference between their allocable share of such retained capital gain and their share of the tax paid by us corporate us shareholders may be required to treat up to  of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income longterm capital gains are generally taxable at maximum us federal income tax rates of  for  and subsequent taxable years in the case of us shareholders taxed at individual rates and  for corporations capital gains attributable to the sale of depreciable real property held for more than  months are subject to a  maximum us federal income tax rate for us shareholders taxed at individual rates to the extent of previously claimed depreciation deductions us shareholders taxed at individual rates may also be subject to the  medicare tax on all capital gains the aggregate amount of dividends that we may designate as “capital gain dividends” or “qualified dividend income” as discussed below with respect to any taxable year may not exceed the dividends paid by us with respect to such year including dividends that are paid in the following year if they are declared before we timely file our tax return for the year and if made with or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration are treated as paid with respect to such year distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a us shareholder to the extent that they do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of the us shareholder’s shares in respect of which the distributions were made but rather will reduce the adjusted tax basis of these shares to the extent that such distributions exceed the adjusted tax basis of an individual us shareholder’s shares they will be included in income as longterm capital gain or shortterm capital gain if the shares have been held for one year or less in addition any dividend declared by us in october november or december of any year and payable to a us shareholder of record on a specified date in any such month will be treated as both paid by us and received by the us shareholder on december  of such year provided that the dividend is actually paid by us before the end of january of the following calendar year with respect to us shareholders taxed at individual rates we may elect to designate a portion of its distributions paid to such us shareholders as “qualified dividend income” a portion of a distribution that is properly designated as qualified dividend income is taxable to noncorporate us shareholders as capital gain provided that the us shareholder has held the shares with respect to which the distribution is    made for more than  days during the day period beginning on the date that is  days before the date on which such shares became exdividend with respect to the relevant distribution the maximum amount of our distribution s eligible to be designated as qualified dividend income for a taxable year is equal to the sum of a the qualified dividend income received by us during such taxable year from nonreit corporations that are subject to us federal income tax b the excess of any “undistributed” reit taxable income recognized during the immediately preceding year over the us federal income tax paid by us with respect to such undistributed reit taxable income and c the excess of any income recognized during the immediately preceding year attributable to the sale of a builtingain asset that was acquired in a carryover basis transaction from a nonreit c corporation over the us federal income tax paid by us with respect to such builtin gain in addition to the extent trft pays dividends to us comprised of the above items our dividends should generally be treated as qualified dividend income generally dividends that we receive will be treated as qualified dividend income for purposes of a above if the dividends are received from a domestic corporation other than a reit or a ric that is subject to us federal income tax or a “qualifying foreign corporation” and specified holding period requirements and other requirements are met we expect that any foreign corporate cdo entity in which we or the reit affiliates invest would not be a “qualifying foreign corporation” and accordingly our distribution of any income with respect to such entities will not constitute “qualified dividend income” to the extent that we or the reit affiliates have available net operating losses and capital losses carried forward from prior tax years such losses may reduce the amount of distributions that must be made in order to comply with the reit distribution requirements see “—taxation of reits in general” “—annual distribution requirements” and “use of net operating loss carry forwards” such losses however are not passed through to our shareholders and in the case of trft are not passed through to us and do not offset income of our shareholders from other sources nor do they affect the character of any distributions that are actually made by us which are generally subject to tax in the hands of our shareholders to the extent that we have current or accumulated earnings and profits dispositions of our shares of beneficial interest in general a us shareholder will realize gain or loss upon the sale redemption or other taxable disposition of our shares of beneficial interest in an amount equal to the difference between the sum of the fair market value of any property and the amount of cash received in such disposition and the us shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in the shares at the time of the disposition in general a us shareholder’s adjusted tax basis will equal the us shareholder’s acquisition cost increased by the excess of net capital gains deemed distributed to the us shareholder discussed above less tax deemed paid on it and reduced by returns of capital in general capital gains recognized by individual us shareholders upon the sale or disposition of our shares of beneficial interest will be subject to a maximum us federal income tax rate of  for  and subsequent taxable years if our shares of beneficial interest are held for more than  months and will be taxed at ordinary income rates of up to  for  and subsequent taxable years if our shares of beneficial interest are held for  months or less dividends and gains for the sale of our shares will also be subject to a  medicare surtax in the case of taxpayers whose modified adjusted gross income exceeds certain thresholds gains recognized by us shareholders that are corporations are subject to us federal income tax at a maximum rate of  whether or not classified as longterm capital gains the irs has the authority to prescribe but has not yet prescribed regulations that would apply a us federal income tax rate of  which is generally higher than the longterm capital gain tax rates for noncorporate holders to a portion of capital gain realized by us shareholders taxed at individual rates on the sale of reit shares that would correspond to the reit’s “unrecaptured section  gain” capital losses recognized by a us shareholder upon the disposition of our shares of beneficial interest held for more than one year at the time of disposition will be considered longterm capital losses and are generally available only to offset capital gain income of the us shareholder but not ordinary income except in the case of individuals who may offset up to  of ordinary income each year in addition any loss upon a sale or exchange of our shares of beneficial interest by a us shareholder who has held the shares of beneficial interest for six months or less after applying holding period rules will be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent of distributions received from us that were required to be treated by the us shareholder as longterm capital gain redemption of offered preferred shares  redemption of offered preferred shares for cash will be treated under section  of the code as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits at ordinary income rates unless the redemption satisfies one of the tests set forth in section b of the code for the sale or exchange of the redeemable shares the redemption will be treated as a sale or exchange if it i is “substantially disproportionate” with respect to you ii results in a “complete termination” of your share interest in us or iii is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to you all within the meaning of section b of the code in determining whether any of these tests have been met common shares all series of preferred shares and any options to acquire the foregoing considered to be owned by you by reason of certain constructive ownership rules set forth in the code as well as common shares all series of preferred shares and any options to acquire the foregoing actually owned by you must generally be taken into account if you do not own actually or constructively any of our common shares or you own an insubstantial percentage of our outstanding common shares or preferred shares based upon current law a redemption of your preferred shares is likely to qualify for sale or exchange treatment because the redemption would not be “essentially equivalent to a dividend” however because the determination as to whether any of the alternative tests    of se ction b of the code will be satisfied with respect to your preferred shares depends upon the facts and circumstances at the time the determination must be made you are advised to consult your own tax advisor to determine such tax treatment if a redemption of preferred shares is not treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to you it will be treated as a taxable sale or exchange of the shares as a result you will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between i the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received less any portion thereof attributable to accumulated and declared but unpaid dividends which will be taxable as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and ii your adjusted basis in the preferred shares for tax purposes such gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the preferred shares have been held as a capital asset and will be longterm gain or loss if the preferred shares have been held for more than one year at the time of the redemption if a redemption of preferred shares is treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend the amount of the distribution will be measured by the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received by you your adjusted basis in the redeemable preferred shares for tax purposes will be transferred to your remaining shares in us if you do not own any of our other shares such basis may under certain circumstances be transferred to a related person or it may be lost entirely the irs published proposed treasury regulations that would require a sharebyshare determination upon redemption so that a holder with varying tax basis for its shares of preferred stock could have taxable income with respect some shares even though the holder’s aggregate basis for the shares would be sufficient to absorb the entire redemption distribution additionally these proposed treasury regulations would not permit the transfer of basis in the redeemed shares to the remaining shares of our stock held directly or indirectly by the redeemed holder instead the unrecovered basis in our preferred shares would be treated as a deferred loss to be recognized when certain conditions are satisfied these proposed treasury regulations would be effective for transactions that occur after the date the regulations are published as final treasury regulations passive activity losses and investment interest limitations distributions made by us and gain arising from the sale or exchange by a us shareholder of our shares of beneficial interest will not be treated as passive activity income as a result us shareholders will not be able to apply any “passive losses” against income or gain relating to its ownership of our shares of beneficial interest distributions made by us to the extent they do not constitute a return of capital generally will be treated as investment income for purposes of computing the investment interest limitation a us shareholder that elects to treat capital gain dividends capital gains from the disposition of shares of beneficial interest or qualified dividend income as investment income for purposes of the investment interest limitation will be taxed at ordinary income rates on such amounts taxation of taxexempt us shareholders us taxexempt entities including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts generally are exempt from us federal income taxation however they are subject to taxation on their ubti while many investments in real estate may generate ubti the irs has ruled that dividend distributions from a reit to a taxexempt entity do not constitute ubti based on that ruling and provided that  a taxexempt us shareholder has not held our shares of beneficial interest as “debt financed property” within the meaning of the internal revenue code  ie where the acquisition or holding of the property is financed through a borrowing by the taxexempt shareholder  the shares of beneficial interest of us are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business and  we and the reit affiliates do not hold an asset that generates “excess inclusion income” see “—effect of subsidiary entities—taxable mortgage pools” and “—excess inclusion income” distributions from us and income from the sale of our shares of beneficial interest should generally not be treated as ubti to a taxexempt us shareholder we do not currently own and we do not intend to acquire in the future any ubti producing assets taxexempt us shareholders that are social clubs voluntary employee benefit associations supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans exempt from us federal income taxation under sections c c c and c of the internal revenue code respectively are subject to different ubti rules which generally will require them to characterize distributions from us as ubti in certain circumstances a pension trust  that is described in section a of the internal revenue code  is tax exempt under section a of the internal revenue code and  that owns more than  of our shares of beneficial interest could be required to treat a percentage of the dividends from us as ubti if we are a “pensionheld reit” we will not be a pensionheld reit unless  either a one pension trust owns more than  of the value of our shares of beneficial interest or b a group of pension trusts each individually holding more than  of the value of our shares of beneficial interest collectively owns more than  of such shares and  we would not have qualified as a reit but for the fact that section h of the internal revenue code provides that shares owned by such trusts shall be treated for purposes of the requirement that not more than  of the value of the outstanding shares of a reit is owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer “individuals” as defined in the internal revenue code to include certain entities by the beneficiaries of such trusts certain restrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares of beneficial interest should generally prevent a taxexempt entity from owning more than  of the value of our shares of beneficial interest or us from becoming a pensionheld reit taxexempt us shareholders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the us federal state local and foreign tax consequences of owning our shares of beneficial interest taxation of nonus shareholders the following is a summary of certain us federal income tax consequences of the acquisition ownership and disposition of our shares of beneficial interest applicable to nonus shareholders of our shares of beneficial interest for purposes of this summary a nonus shareholder is a beneficial owner of our shares of beneficial interest that is not a us shareholder or an entity taxed as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes the discussion is based on current law and is for general information only it addresses only selective and not all aspects of us federal income taxation      ordinary dividends the portion of dividends received by nonus shareholders payable out of our earnings and profits that are not att ributable to gains from sales or exchanges of us real property interests or usrpis and which are not effectively connected with a us trade or business of the nonus shareholder will generally be subject to us federal withholding tax at the rate o f  unless reduced or eliminated by an applicable income tax treaty under some treaties however lower rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from reits in addition any portion of the dividends paid to nonus shareholder s that are treated as excess inclusion income will not be eligible for exemption from the  withholding tax or a reduced treaty rate as previously noted we and the reit affiliates may engage in transactions that result in a portion of our dividends bei ng considered “excess inclusion income” and accordingly it is possible that a portion of our dividends received by a nonus shareholder will not be eligible for exemption from the  withholding tax or a reduced treaty rate in general nonus shareholders will not be considered to be engaged in a us trade or business solely as a result of their ownership of our shares of beneficial interest in cases where the dividend income from a nonus shareholder’s investment in our shares of beneficial interest is or is treated as effectively connected with the nonus shareholder’s conduct of a us trade or business the nonus shareholder generally will be subject to us federal income tax at graduated rates in the same manner as us shareholders are taxed with respect to such dividends and may also be subject to a  branch profits tax after the application of the us federal income tax in the case of a nonus shareholderthat is a corporation certain nonus shareholders are subject to us federal withholding tax at a rate of  on dividends paid on our shares of beneficial interest if certain disclosure requirements related to us ownership are not satisfied in addition if those disclosure requirements are not satisfied a us federal withholding tax at a rate of  will be imposed for taxable years beginning after december   on proceeds from the sale of shares received by certain nonus shareholders if payment of withholding taxes is required nonus shareholders that are otherwise eligible for an exemption from or reduction of us federal withholding taxes with respect to such distributions and proceeds will be required to seek a refund from the internal revenue service to obtain the benefit or such exemption or reduction nondividend distributions unless a our shares of beneficial interest constitute a usrpi or b either  if the nonus shareholder’s investment in our shares of beneficial interest is effectively connected with a us trade or business conducted by such nonus shareholder in which case the nonus shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as us shareholders with respect to such gain or  if the nonus shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the united states for  days or more during the taxable year and has a “tax home” in the united states in which case the nonus shareholder will be subject to a  tax on the individual’s net capital gain for the year distributions by us which are not dividends out of our earnings and profits will not be subject to us federal income tax if it cannot be determined at the time at which a distribution is made whether or not the distribution will exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits the distribution will be subject to withholding at the rate applicable to dividends however the nonus shareholder may seek a refund from the irs of any amounts withheld if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was in fact in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits if our shares of beneficial interest constitute a usrpi as described below distributions by us in excess of the sum of our earnings and profits plus the nonus shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in our shares of beneficial interest will be taxed under the foreign investment in real property tax act of  or firpta at the rate of tax including any applicable capital gains rates that would apply to a us shareholder of the same type  eg  an individual or a corporation and the collection of the tax will be enforced by a withholding at a rate of  of the amount by which the distribution exceeds the shareholder’s share of our earnings and profits capital gain dividends under firpta a distribution made by us to a nonus shareholder to the extent attributable to gains from dispositions of usrpis held by us directly or through passthrough subsidiaries or usrpi capital gains will be considered effectively connected with a us trade or business of the nonus shareholder and will be subject to us federal income tax at the rates applicable to us shareholders without regard to whether the distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend in addition we will be required to withhold tax equal to  of the amount of capital gain dividends to the extent the dividends constitute usrpi capital gains moreover if a nonus shareholder disposes of our shares of beneficial interest during the day period preceding a dividend payment by us and such nonus shareholder or a person related to such nonus shareholder acquires or enters into a contract or option to acquire our shares of beneficial interest within  days of the first day of the day period described above and any portion of such dividend payment would but for the disposition be treated as a usrpi capital gain to such nonus shareholder then such nonus shareholder shall be treated as having usrpi capital gain in an amount that but for the disposition would have been treated as usrpi capital gain distributions subject to firpta may also be subject to a  branch profits tax when received by a nonus shareholder that is a corporation however the  withholding tax will not apply to any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of our shares of beneficial interest which is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the united states if the nonus shareholder did not own more than   for  and prior years of such class of shares at any time during the taxable year instead any capital gain dividend will be treated as a distribution subject to the rules discussed above under “—taxation of nonus shareholders” and “—ordinary dividends” also the branch profits tax will not apply to such a distribution a distribution is not a usrpi capital gain if we held the underlying asset solely as a creditor although the holding of a shared appreciation mortgage loan would not be solely as a creditor capital gain dividends received by a nonus shareholder from a reit that are not usrpi capital gains generally are not subject to us federal income or withholding tax unless either  if the nonus shareholder’s investment in our shares of beneficial interest is effectively connected with a us trade or business conducted by such nonus shareholder in which case the nonus shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as us shareholders with respect to such gain or  if the nonus shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the united states for  days or more during the taxable year and has a “tax home” in the united states in which case the nonus shareholder will be subject to a  tax on the individual’s net capital gain for the year dispositions of our shares of beneficial interest unless our shares of beneficial interest constitute a usrpi a sale of the shares by a nonus shareholder generally will not be subject to us federal income taxation under firpta the shares will not be treated as a usrpi if less    than  of our assets throughout a prescribed testing period consist of interests in real property located within the united states excluding for this purpose interests in real property solely in a capacity as a creditor w e do not expect that more than  of our assets including our proportionate share of trft’s assets will consist of interests in real property located in the united states in addition our shares of beneficial interest will not constitute a usrpi if we are a “domestically controlled reit” a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than  in value of its outstanding shares is held directly or indirectly by nonus shareholders we believe that we are and expect us to continue to be a domestically controlled reit and therefore the sale of our shares of beneficial interest should not be subject to taxation under firpta however because our shares of beneficial interest are widely held and publicly traded we cannot assure investors that we are or will remain a domestically controlled reit even if we do not qualify as a domestically controlled reit a nonus shareholder’s sale of our shares of beneficial interest nonetheless will generally not be subject to tax under firpta as a sale of a usrpi provided that a our shares of beneficial interest owned are of a class that is “regularly traded” as defined by the applicable treasury regulations on an established securities market and b the selling nonus shareholder owned actually or constructively  or less of our outstanding shares of that class at all times during a specified testing period if gain on the sale of our shares of beneficial interest were subject to taxation under firpta the nonus shareholder would be subject to the same treatment as a us shareholder with respect to such gain subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the purchaser of the shares could be required to withhold  of the purchase price and remit such amount to the irs gain from the sale of our shares of beneficial interest that would not otherwise be subject to firpta will nonetheless be taxable in the united states to a nonus shareholder in two cases a if the nonus shareholder’s investment in our shares of beneficial interest is effectively connected with a us trade or business conducted by such nonus shareholder the nonus shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as a us shareholder with respect to such gain or b if the nonus shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who was present in the united states for  days or more during the taxable year and has a “tax home” in the united states the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a  tax on the individual’s capital gain additional exemption from firpta    recent legislation provides for additional exemptions from firpta applicable to “qualified shareholders” and “qualified foreign pension plans” as further described below subject to the exception discussed below any distribution to a “qualified shareholder” who holds reit stock directly or indirectly through one or more partnerships will not be subject to us tax as income effectively connected with a us trade or business and thus will not be subject to special withholding rules under firpta  while a “qualified shareholder” will not be subject to firpta withholding on reit distributions certain investors of a “qualified shareholder” ie nonus persons who hold interests in the “qualified shareholder” other than interests solely as a creditor and hold more than  of the stock of such reit whether or not by reason of the investor’s ownership in the “qualified shareholder” may be subject to firpta withholding in addition a sale of our stock by a “qualified shareholder” who holds such stock directly or indirectly through one or more partnerships will not be subject to us federal income taxation under firpta as with distributions certain investors of a “qualified shareholder” ie nonus persons who hold interests in the “qualified shareholder” other than interests solely as a creditor and hold more than  of the stock of such reit whether or not by reason of the investor’s

pension fund” who holds reit stock directly or indirectly through one or more partnerships will not be subject to us tax as income effectively connected with a us trade or business and thus will not be subject to special withholding rules under firpta  in addition a sale of our stock by a “qualified foreign pension fund” that holds such stock directly or indirectly through one or more partnerships    will not be subject to us federal income taxation under firpta a qualified foreign pension fund is any trust corporation or other organization or arrangement i which is created or
