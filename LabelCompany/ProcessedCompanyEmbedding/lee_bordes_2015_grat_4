magazine are two of its most distinctive features this photo shows a canadian soldier in world war ii standing at the ready with an early production leeenfield no  mark i boltaction rifle also note the earlystyle bayonet with its distinctive cruciform spike blade integral charger guides on the no ’s receiver made it easy to rapidly load the round magazine with stripper clips the rifle’s bolt handle was located immediately above the trigger for rapid manipulation integral charger guides on the no ’s receiver made it easy to rapidly load the round magazine with stripper clips the rifle’s bolt handle was located immediately above the trigger for rapid manipulation the no  rifle had a short segment of exposed barrel with front sight guards and lugs for mounting a socket bayonet the bayonet’s inch spike blade limited its usefulness and it was disliked by many british soldiers the no ’s rear sight had a large aperture sight and a foldup leaf adjustable from  to  yards british “enfield” rifles are some of the most iconic small arms in the world having served around the world they are the symbol of british power the no  mark iii leeenfield rifle is without a doubt one of the most widely recognized of these its reputation for ruggedness and reliability are legendary while its smoothly operating bolt and round chargerloaded magazine gave the british “tommy” a significant firepower advantage over his adversaries at the turn of the th century related story the best wartime firearms that appeared in movies get this issue now only two complaints worth heeding had arisen about the no  during world war i the rear sight and the thin barrel experience with the americanmade p enfield rifle had shown that an aperture rear sight would be more practical and easier to use while making the barrel heavier and modifying the stock to allow the barrel to be freefloating would improve accuracy arsenal upgrade work on a new rifle began at the enfield arsenal in  and by  approximately  no  rifles had been modified for troop trials these experimental no  mk v rifles had the same general appearance as the mk iii except for a receivermounted aperture rear sight which was adjustable from  to  yards and an additional fitted barrel band further development was deemed necessary and between  and  another rifle the no  mk vi was produced for extended field trials the receiver was completely redesigned to ease production but at the same time a better grade of steel was utilized to increase its strength while the no ’s receiver had a nicely rounded profile that of the mk vi was all flat surfaces and right angles the bolt and magazine were modified so that they were not interchangeable with those of the no  instead a new bolt catch was used and the charger guides were integral with the receiver that th century anachronism the magazine cutoff was discarded and a number of stamped parts replaced those previously forged in november of  the improved rifle no  mk i officially replaced the longserving no  as the standard rifle of the british army the no ’s most distinctive feature apart from the traditional leeenfield twopiece stock was a short length of barrel with front sight guards and lugs for a socket bayonet that was left exposed by a shorter forearm despite its heavier barrel the new rifle was  ounces lighter than the no  and was not only faster and cheaper to produce but displayed superior handling characteristics and improved accuracy in the field the no  rifle fired the standard  mark vii cartridge this had been adopted in  and consisted of a rimmed bottlenecked case mm long loaded with a grain fmj spitzer bullet with a muzzle velocity of  feet per second fps the outbreak of world war ii prevented full reequipping of the british army with the no  rifle and most units continued to use the no  rifle production of the no  was undertaken at rsaf enfield royal ordnance factories rof at fazakerley and maltby and birmingham small arms bsa as demand outstripped production facilities in the uk both the long branch arsenal in ontario canada and the savage arms company in massachusetts began production of no  rifles for the canadian and british armies simplified design changes began appearing in the no  almost immediately as the different manufacturers attempted to make the rifle easier to produce more and more stamped metal parts were used a simple lshaped flipup rear sight with apertures for  and  yards was adopted and barrels were made with twogroove instead of fourgroove rifling instead of a blued finish the rifles were parkerized or used a bakedon enamel finish walnut stocks were replaced with ones made from beech and birch these modifications first appeared on canadian and usmade rifles leading to them being designated the “rifle no  mk i” the bayonet was simplified with the cruciform spike being replaced by the mk ii mk ii and mk iii bayonets which were simply sharpened rods these were unpopular as they were not capable of performing the bayonet’s most important task during a deployment—opening ration tins besides the original mk i rear sight which was machined from steel and had a fine adjustment knob and the simple lshaped mk iii sight no  rifles can be found with mk iii mk iv c mk ii c mk iii and c mk iv sights while similar to the mk i sight they were made from stamped steel and elevation adjustment was by means of a simple spring catch no  rifles were first issued to british troops in the spring of  and they proved even better battle rifles than had the no  mark iii which was no small feat given the earlier rifle’s well deserved reputation during the war sniper rifles were assembled by bsa and the firm holland  holland from no  rifles selected for their accuracy each was fitted with a no  mk i telescopic sight and a cheekpiece stock two versions of the rifle were assembled the no  mk i t and no  mk i t by  production of no  rifles had ended except in australia and india whose armies declined to accept the no  as they felt the cost of retooling their respective production facilities would be prohibitive both nations continued to produce and issue the no  throughout the war years and in some cases well into the s by  most british troops had been rearmed with the no  rifle and the no s were withdrawn from service and relegated to war reserve status besides england the no  rifle was the primary rifle of the canadian army and they were supplied to the free french greek dutch belgian polish czech and norwegian units fighting alongside the british army savage also supplied about  no  rifles to the nationalist chinese government by  over  million no  rifles had been produced with bsa and savage accounting for almost  percent of the total going global after the war the british army rebuilt many no  rifles with mk i rear sights and new stocks in  enfield developed a new trigger unit for the no  that pivoted on the underside of the receiver instead of the triggerguard and required that modified rifles have a new forearm installed thousands of no  mk i rifles were updated with the new trigger while new purposebuilt rifles designated the no  mk ii were assembled at the rof mk ii rifles were generally issued with the no  mk i bayonet which featured a much more practical inch bowietype blade the improved rifle no  mk ii remained the standard british service rifle into the late s when it was replaced by the mm la fn fal semiauto rifle britishsupplied no  rifles saw service with government forces during the bloody greek civil war and it was the standard rifle of the british and canadian contingents serving with un forces during the korean conflict it also saw wide use by both israel and its arab adversaries during fighting that characterized the founding of the jewish state many of these rifles were used by the french army during their unsuccessful campaigns against nationalist forces in southeast asia the middle east and north africa they were widely used by both dutch forces and indonesian nationalist guerillas during the fighting in the dutch east indies until it was replaced by soviet weaponry in the s and s no  rifles were used by the armies of egypt syria jordan iraq and pakistan they showed up in all of the conflicts that raged across the middle east north africa subsaharan africa the indian subcontinent and southeast asia and are still seen today in the hands of guerilla fighters in all these regions it should be noted that until  the no  was the standardissue rifle of the canadian rangers composed mostly of inuit volunteers they are a subcomponent of the canadian forces reserve and provide a military presence in canada’s sparsely settled northern coastal and isolated areas on the range for this article i test fired a no  mk ii rifle from my personal collection that was made at the rof fazakerley in  it is in like new unissued condition with a mirrorbright bore although the trigger pull was a bit on the heavy side test firing was performed from a caldwell lead sled on my club’s  yards with remingtonumc and serbianmade ppu  british ammunition both of which approximated the ballistics of the mk vii cartridge folding up the rear sight i sent the aperture on  yards and proceeded to fire for score the heavy trigger required a bit of nursing along but once i had the measure of it i proceeded to produce a halfdozen fiveshot groups in the  to inch range printing deadon to point of aim after i was done with the accuracy testing i scrounged a dozen drink cans from the range dumpster and placed them on the yard backstop i then ran the no  through a series of offhand rapidfire drills the bolt was fast smooth and positive in operation—as leeenfields have been known for since the s—and reloading with fiveround chargers proved quick and easy allowing me to maintain an impressive rate of fire and make the cans dance to my tune at the range related story  short magazine leeenfield after policing up the punctured cans and depositing them in the dumpster i paused and thought about the leeenfield this rifle of rifles served king queen and country for seven decades and its place in the history of the british empire borders on iconic every time i see one i am reminded of that stereotypical british sergeantmajor we have seen portrayed so many times on the screen tough rugged and maybe just a bit rough around the edges—but very good at what he does both he and leeenfield got their reputations the oldfashioned way they earned them more firearms jul   inland’s advisor m pistol

august   and originally consisted of six marshals americas first motion picture industryedit the history of cinema in the united states can trace its roots to the east coast where at one time fort lee was the motion picture capital of america the industry got its start at the end of the th century with the construction of thomas edisons black maria the first motion picture studio in west orange new jersey new jersey offered land at costs considerably less than new york city and the cities and towns on the north river hudson river and hudson palisades benefited greatly as a result of the phenomenal growth of the film industry at the turn of the th century filmmaking began attracting both capital and an innovative workforce and when the kalem company began using fort lee in  as a location for filming in the area other filmmakers quickly followed in  a forerunner of universal studios the champion film company built the first studio they were quickly followed by others who either built new studios or who leased facilities in fort lee in the s and s film companies such as the independent moving pictures company peerless studios the solax company éclair studios goldwyn picture corporation american méliès star films world film company biograph studios fox film corporation pathé frères metro pictures corporation victor film company and selznick pictures corporation

hollywood in  nestor studios owned by david and william horsley later merged with universal studios and william horsleys other company hollywood film laboratory is now the oldest existing company in hollywood now called the hollywood digital laboratory californias more hospitable and costeffective climate led to the eventual shift of virtually all filmmaking to the west coast by the s at the time thomas edison owned almost all the patents relevant to motion picture production movie producers on the east coast acting independently of edisons motion picture patents company were often sued or enjoined by edison and his agents while movie makers working on the west coast could work independently of edisons control television and film in new jersey remains an important industry since  the fort lee film commission has been charged with celebrating the history of film in fort lee as well as attracting film and television production companies to the borough birthplace of subliminal sharingsedit in  market researcher james vicary claimed that quickly flashing messages on a movie screen in fort lee had influenced people to purchase more food and drinks vicary coined the term subliminal advertising and formed the subliminal projection company based on a sixweek test vicary claimed that during the presentation of the movie picnic he used a tachistoscope to project the words drink cocacola and hungry eat popcorn for  of a second at fivesecond intervals vicary asserted that during the test sales of popcorn and coke in that new jersey theater increased  and  respectively in  vicary admitted to lying about the experiment and falsifying the results the story itself being a marketing ploy an identical experiment conducted by henry link showed no increase in cola or popcorn sales the claim that the small cinema handled  visitors in six weeks has led people to believe that vicary actually did not conduct his experiment at all george washington bridge lane closure scandaledit the fort lee lane closure scandal also known as bridgegate was a political scandal concerning the actions taken by the staff of new jersey governor chris christie and his port authority appointees to create a traffic jam in fort lee when dedicated toll lanes for one of the fort lee entrances to the upper level on the george washington bridge were reduced from three to one from september   to september   three members of the christie administration were convicted on federal conspiracy charges for their roles in the lane closures one of the reasons suggested for these actions was to punish fort lee mayor mark sokolich a democrat for not supporting the republican chris christie in the  new jersey gubernatorial election another theory was that christie or his aides sought to punish new jersey senate majority leader loretta weinberg who represented the new jersey district containing fort lee as retribution for the democrats blocking of christies reappointment of a new jersey supreme court justice christie withdrew his appointee consideration and delivered a speech referring to new jersey senate democrats as animals just one day before emails were sent by christies aides to the port authority requesting the lane closures demographicsedit fort lee koreatown 포트 리 코리아타운 is centered at the intersection of main street and route  lemoine avenue at the turn of the st

industryedit the history of cinema in the united states can trace its roots to the east coast where at one time fort lee was the motion picture capital of america the industry got its start at the end of the th century with the construction of thomas edisons black maria the first motion picture studio in west orange new jersey new jersey offered land at costs considerably less than new york city and the cities and towns on the north river hudson river and hudson palisades benefited greatly as a result of the phenomenal growth of the film industry at the turn of the th century filmmaking began attracting both capital and an innovative workforce and when the kalem company began using fort lee in  as a location for filming in the area other filmmakers quickly followed in  a forerunner of universal studios the champion film company built the first studio they were quickly followed by others who either built new studios or who leased facilities in fort lee in the s and s film companies

asserted that during the test sales of popcorn and coke in that new jersey theater increased  and  respectively in  vicary admitted to lying about the experiment and falsifying the results the story itself being a marketing ploy an identical experiment conducted by henry link showed no increase in cola or popcorn sales the claim that the small cinema handled  visitors in six weeks has led people to believe that vicary actually did not conduct his experiment at all george washington bridge lane closure scandaledit the fort lee lane closure scandal also known as bridgegate was a political scandal concerning the actions taken by the staff of new jersey governor chris christie and his port authority appointees to create a traffic jam in fort lee when dedicated toll lanes for one of the fort lee entrances to the upper level on the george washington bridge were reduced from three to one from september   to september   three members of the christie administration were convicted on federal conspiracy charges for their roles in the lane closures one of the reasons suggested for these actions was to punish fort lee mayor mark sokolich a democrat for not supporting the republican chris christie in the  new jersey gubernatorial election another theory was that christie or his aides sought to punish new jersey senate majority leader loretta weinberg who represented the new jersey district containing fort lee as retribution for the democrats blocking of christies reappointment of a new jersey supreme court justice christie withdrew his appointee consideration and delivered a speech referring to new jersey senate democrats as animals just one day before emails were sent by christies aides to the port authority requesting the lane closures demographicsedit fort

industryedit the history of cinema in the united states can trace its roots to the east coast where at one time fort lee was the motion picture capital of america the industry got its start at the end of the th century with the construction of thomas edisons black maria the first motion picture studio in west orange new jersey new jersey offered land at costs considerably less than new york city and the cities and towns on the north river hudson river and hudson palisades benefited greatly as a result of the phenomenal growth of the film industry at the turn of the th century filmmaking began attracting both capital and an innovative workforce and when the kalem company began using fort lee in  as a location for filming in the area other filmmakers quickly followed in  a forerunner of

asserted that during the test sales of popcorn and coke in that new jersey theater increased  and  respectively in  vicary admitted to lying about the experiment and falsifying the results the story itself being a marketing ploy an identical experiment conducted by henry link showed no increase in cola or popcorn sales the claim that the small cinema handled  visitors in six weeks has led people to believe that vicary actually did not conduct his experiment at all george washington bridge lane closure scandaledit the fort lee lane closure scandal also known as bridgegate was a political

federal conspiracy charges for their roles in the lane closures one of the reasons suggested for these actions was to punish fort lee mayor mark sokolich a democrat for not supporting the republican chris christie in the  new jersey gubernatorial election another theory was that christie or his aides sought to punish new jersey senate majority leader loretta weinberg who represented the new

industryedit the history of cinema in the united states can trace its roots to the east coast where at one time fort lee was the motion picture capital of america the industry got its start at the end of the th century with the construction of thomas edisons black maria the first motion picture studio in west orange new jersey new jersey offered land at costs considerably less than new york city and the cities and towns on the north river hudson river and hudson palisades benefited greatly as a result of the phenomenal growth of the film industry at the turn of the th century filmmaking began attracting both capital and an innovative workforce and when the kalem company began using fort lee in  as a location for filming in the area other filmmakers quickly followed in  a forerunner of

asserted that during the test sales of popcorn and coke in that new jersey theater increased  and  respectively in  vicary admitted to lying about the experiment and falsifying the results the story itself being a marketing ploy an identical experiment conducted by henry link showed no increase in cola or popcorn sales the claim that the small cinema handled  visitors in six weeks has led people

fort lee entrances to the upper level on the george washington bridge were reduced from three to one from september   to september   three members of the christie administration were convicted on federal conspiracy charges for their roles in the lane closures one of the reasons suggested for these actions was to punish fort lee mayor mark sokolich a democrat for not supporting the republican chris christie in the  new jersey gubernatorial election another theory was that christie or his aides sought to punish new jersey senate majority leader loretta weinberg who represented the new jersey district containing fort lee as retribution for the democrats blocking of christies reappointment of a new jersey supreme court justice christie withdrew his appointee consideration and delivered a speech referring to new jersey senate democrats as animals just one day before emails were sent by christies aides to the port authority requesting the lane closures demographicsedit fort

industryedit the history of cinema in the united states can trace its roots to the east coast where at one time fort lee was the motion picture capital of america the industry got its start at the end of the th century with the construction of thomas edisons black maria the first motion picture studio in west orange new jersey new jersey offered land at costs considerably less than new york city and the cities and towns on the north river hudson river and hudson palisades benefited greatly as a result of the phenomenal growth of the film industry at the turn of the th century filmmaking began attracting both capital and an innovative workforce and when the kalem company began using fort lee in  as a location for filming in the area other filmmakers quickly followed in  a forerunner of universal studios the champion film company built the first studio they were quickly followed by others who either built new studios or who leased facilities in fort lee in the s and s film companies

asserted that during the test sales of popcorn and coke in that new jersey theater increased  and  respectively in  vicary admitted to lying about the experiment and falsifying the results the story itself being a marketing ploy an identical experiment conducted by henry link showed no increase in cola or popcorn sales the claim that the small cinema handled  visitors in six weeks has led people to believe that vicary actually did not conduct his experiment at all george washington bridge lane closure scandaledit the fort lee lane closure scandal also known as bridgegate was a political

fort lee entrances to the upper level on the george washington bridge were reduced from three to one from september   to september   three members of the christie administration were convicted on federal conspiracy charges for their roles in the lane closures one of the reasons suggested for these actions was to punish fort lee mayor mark sokolich a democrat for not supporting the republican chris christie in the  new jersey gubernatorial election another theory was that christie or his aides sought to punish new jersey senate majority leader loretta weinberg who represented the new jersey district containing fort lee as retribution for the democrats blocking of christies reappointment of a new jersey supreme court justice christie withdrew his appointee consideration and delivered a speech referring to new jersey senate democrats as animals just one day before emails were sent by christies aides to the port authority requesting the lane closures demographicsedit fort

itself being a marketing ploy an identical experiment conducted by henry link showed no increase in cola or popcorn sales the claim that the small cinema handled  visitors in six weeks has led people

fort lee entrances to the upper level on the george washington bridge were reduced from three to one from september   to september   three members of the christie administration were convicted on federal conspiracy charges for their roles in the lane closures one of the reasons suggested for these actions was to punish fort lee mayor mark sokolich a democrat for not supporting the republican chris christie in the  new jersey gubernatorial election another theory was that christie or his aides sought to punish new jersey senate majority leader loretta weinberg who represented the new jersey district containing fort lee as retribution for the democrats blocking of christies reappointment of a new jersey supreme court justice christie withdrew his appointee consideration and delivered a speech referring to new jersey senate democrats as animals just one day before emails were sent by christies aides to the port authority requesting the lane closures demographicsedit fort
