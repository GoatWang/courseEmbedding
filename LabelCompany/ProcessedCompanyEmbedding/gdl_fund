market value of the fund’s portfolio securities stocks are subject to market economic and business risks that cause their prices to fluctuate investors acquire shares of the fund on a securities exchange at market value which fluctuates according to the dynamics of supply and demand leverage risk the use of leverage which can be described as exposure to changes in price at a ratio greater

of leverage in its investment operations subjects it to substantial risk of loss merger arbitrage risk the principal risk associated with the fund’s investment strategy is that certain of the proposed reorganizations in which the fund invests may be renegotiated terminated or involve a longer time frame than originally contemplated in which case losses may be realized the investment policies of the fund are expected to lead to frequent changes in investments which increase transaction costs to the fund and may also result in accelerated recognition of shortterm capital gain which will be taxable
