interest and are considered payable on demand   risk factors   we have no history in the united states and have not generated any revenues   we have relocated from estonia and have not yet commenced our planned principal operations in the united states nor generated any revenue our activities in the united states since the company’s incorporation in delaware in august  have consisted of formation activities and the raising of capital through the issuance of the crowd notes once we commence our planned principal operations in the united states we will incur significant additional expenses we are dependent upon additional capital resources for the commencement of our planned principal operations and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failing to secure funding to operationalize our planned operations or failing to profitably operate the business            the company’s financial statements include a “going concern” note   even if we are able to successfully begin operations in the united states we may not have enough funds to sustain the business until it becomes profitable we may not accurately anticipate how quickly we may use funds available and if such funds are sufficient to make any profits at all   we operate in a new market in which we are trying to establish and respond to demand that does not yet exist   while the virtual reality vr and augmented reality ar markets have a lot of promise there is no guarantee that consumer adoption of vr and ar products and services will be as swift and large scale as predicted if we are not able to create a big enough market for our products and services we may not be able to keep the company afloat slow consumer adoption of tools and services similar to ours may negatively impact our business   does anyone want our product and will they pay enough for it   we will only succeed if we establish a stable client base including collaborations with large companies active in our markets slow adoption by partners would mean that we would not be able to generate enough revenue from collaborating with them we do not currently know if and when private individuals will be willing to pay for our services   we may not be able to develop and protect technology in accordance with our plans   our plans to further develop our virtual and augmented reality technologies may not be as successful as we hope we may spend a lot of time and money designing the technology only to find out it does not work even if we successfully develop any technology we may not be able to obtain appropriate intellectual property protection for it which would make it less valuable   we may not be able to get patent and other intellectual property protection for our technology in the united states   while we currently hold valid european design patents on apparatus for recording d images there is no guarantee that the us patent office will approve any patent application we may file in a timely manner this could reduce the value of our products and services   we are not going to make any profits for at least three years   we have never had any significant revenues and no profits are projected for the next three years at the very least there is no guarantee we will have any profits after three years or ever            we have a small management team with no us market experience   we depend on the skills and experience of a small management team our management team consists of nonus individuals who have no previous experience with us markets the company needs to hire additional employees and personnel to successfully scale up in particular we will need to hire people with sales and marketing expertise in the united states our ability to raise sufficient capital may have an impact on our ability to attract and hire the right talent   we may not be able to obtain appropriate immigration status for members of our management team or employees or other personnel going forward   the process of moving our main operations to the united states may not go as smoothly as we hope if we encounter immigration law related issues our management team and future employees who are nonus citizens will need appropriate authorization from the united states federal government to work in the united states if formally employed and paid by the company there is no guarantee this will happen as quickly as we hope and in accordance with our needs   we will need more people to join our company   we will need to engage additional engineers and people with the skills necessary to ensure we create and sell a premium product the people we bring on should come with specialized skills that will bring value to the company there are no guarantees that we will be able to find the right people for the job   the company is going to need more money   we will probably need to raise more funds in the future and if we do not raise them we will fail even if we do raise additional capital in the future the terms of the issuance of such securities might result in previous investments in the company being worthless because later investors might receive more favorable terms   we depend on the success of various ongoing discussions with companies able to successfully integrate our products and pay for them   in order to be successful we have to sign cooperation sales and licensing agreements with various large companies operating in the gaming and vrar space these are the companies that have the resources to pay for our products and services on a scale to make our business viable while we have received substantial interest from many of these companies there is no guarantee that we will be able to finalize enough of these agreements in time to keep the company going   we have a number of competitors more established than we are   there are other companies providing services similar to ours some of these companies are large established companies with resources far superior to ours accordingly they may be able to develop technologies better than ours and may succeed in convincing clients to adopt them faster            although dependent on certain key personnel the company does not have any key man life insurance policies on any such people   the company is dependent on timmu tõke in order to conduct its operations and execute its business plan however the company has not purchased any insurance policies with respect to him in the event of his death or disability therefore if timmu tõke dies or becomes disabled the company will not receive any compensation to assist with such person´s absence the loss of such person could negatively affect the company and its operations   we are not subject to sarbanesoxley regulations and lack the financial controls and safeguards required of public companies   we do not have the internal infrastructure necessary and are not required to complete an attestation about our financial controls that would be required under section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  there can be no assurance that there are no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the quality of our financial controls we expect to incur additional expenses and diversion of management´s time if and when it becomes necessary to perform the system and process evaluation testing and remediation required in order to comply with the management certification and auditor attestation requirements   we have not prepared any audited financial statements   therefore you have no audited financial information regarding the company´s capitalization or assets or liabilities   the company´s success depends on the experience and skill of the sole member of its board of directors its executive officers and key employees

wolfprint d is creating realistic avatars of people for vr live on product hunt chat with founders in the comments selfvirtualrealitysubmitted  months ago by tiivikwolfprint dgreetings we are wolfprint d with a mission to bring humanity into vr our d scanning technology enables us to create realistic avatars of people for gaming andor vr experiences quick note we are currently trending on httpswwwproducthuntcom you can find us on the homepage wolfprint d where you can check out the product design and also our equity crowdfunding campaign why is this important in order to make social interactions in vr more natural believable and immersive we believe that every person needs a realistic avatar to represent themselves we are eager to hear from virtual reality communities how they see our product fitting into their games and vr projects interested in using our scan data for your projects if you decide to check out the product hunt page or visit our site httplunascannercomrefproducthunt you can download a sample pack of scan data that can be implemented into games or vr additionally we can provide you with full head models ready for animation and additional support  commentssharereportall  commentssorted by besttopnewcontroversialoldrandomqalive beta–orangepeel  points points points  months ago  childrenphotogrammetry d scanning apps are quickly improving in quality and a lot of them are extremely cost efficient andor free how do you plan to seperate yourself from the app competition aside from a slightly higher quality that scanning apps are almost sure to close the gap with also what price point are you planning on selling to consumers permalinkembedsavegive gold–tiivikwolfprint ds  point points points  months ago  childrenthanks for the comment sure mobile scanning is the future currently however there are no mobile apps out there that can capture a scan that has enough quality that it can be further implemented into gamesvr there are of course many photogrammetry based scanning apps out there but they are mostly meant for scanning static subjects to scan a human you really need a synchronized capture from multiple angles as even the slightest movement can ruin the result now that being said we are also in parallel working on a mobile solution to scale the scan acquisition further  as far as the price point goes we are not completely sure yet we might give people access to the core functionality of importing your scan into a gamevr experience and charge extra for additional features through a monthly subscription those extra features could for instance be customising your avatar with cosmetic upgrades permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold–orangepeel  points point points  months ago  childreninteresting are yall planning on opening your database up for outside scan submissions such as the unity asset store and highfidelityio are currently doing or are you planning on only storing data collected from your booths final question  i saw some animated characters in your video i assume that those are done in post animation do you see any opportunity for capturing movement within the booth permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold–tiivikwolfprint ds  point points points  months ago  childrenwe will enable developers to integrate our scan data into gamesvr experiences through an api currently the data gets to the database from our booths and in the future probably from our d scanning mobile app as we would be the connector for scans and games then it is a good possibility that we will enable other scan providers which could be apps or different types of booths to submit to the overall pool of scans considering that the final output from our side is always a standardised avatar ready to be implemented to games etc yes the animations are currently added in post we have developed a workflow that allows us to take the raw data and turn it into a standardised head model very easily without compromising on scan quality onto that you can apply any animation or asset hats glasses hair styles etc with a press of a button it would definitely be possible to capture facial animation in the booth and apply that onto the model afterwards christmas greetings anyone if we decide to do so permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold–orangepeel  point points points  months ago  childthanks for the info permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold–tiivikwolfprint ds  point points points  months ago  childrenyou are very welcome thanks for joining in permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold–orangepeel  points point points  months ago  childrensorry one more ive seen multiple scanning booths but none with payment options built in do you see any opportunity to work with retailers either through licensing or some sort of payment plan to feature the booths in a retail space selling vrgaming devices permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold–tiivikwolfprint ds  point points points  months ago  childyes in one of our scanners located in heureka science museum in finland we sell digital characters that are connected to the location the characters are then customised with the facial scan data and we include mobile vr headsets with every purchase so that people can check out their characters in vr ensuring that proper licensing deals are in place you could imagine a scenario of taking your scan in the booth and buying a game key right there aswell which means when you go home and install the new gta lets say your character is already waiting  permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold–orangepeel  points points points  months ago  childrenthis would be the most exciting application for me when thinking about a return on investment especially if you are able to work within samsung or microsoft or one of the brands selling headsets the hard part in my opinion would be convincing the consumer purchase an avatar without having a streamlined process of immediately inserting the character into a digital environment if yall can develop that i would be very impressed permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold–remosito  point points points  months ago  childlike the sound of a future where we such d scan boothes accessible and can import the scans into major social vr experiences or fun facial editors how would definitely visit and have a scan made good luck permalinkembedsavegive gold–tiivikwolfprint ds  points point points  months ago  childrenyes thank you thats one of our future goals to extend the usability of our scan data and bring real people into vr apps games chats and so on we think that having a personal avatar is a big leap from generic avatars you can see in demos right now permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold–neonnina  point points points  months ago  childthats a really cool business idea ive read the idea in the books snow crash and ready player one surprised i didnt think of it as applicable to modern vr permalinkembedsavegive gold–tiivikwolfprint ds  point points points  months ago  children thats a really cool business idea ive read the idea in the books snow crash and ready player one surprised i didnt think of it as applicable to modern vr yes imagine a large number of people conversing in vr and they would actually be recognizable one thing is communicating with people you see every day like your family or coworkers another thing is meeting facetoface with people you might never meet in real life imagine a well known coach giving a lecture in vr to thousands of people at the same time while everyone gets a personal session permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold–anothervrdev  point points points  months ago  childcongrats on your progress so far it seems pretty daunting to build a platform like this around an open file format do you plan to retain your file format in obj or are you developing a proprietary means for accessing the models permalinkembedsavegive gold–tiivikwolfprint ds  point points points  months ago  childrenin order to connect as many people with vr apps or games as possible we need to make sure that the final output from us is something thats as straight forward to use for developers as it can be we are currently growing our database and making first tests integrating our scans into social vr environments so the file format requirement really isnt ironed out yet what i can say however as even the first tests we have run now have animated faces we most likely wont output just obj files the decision to use obj as the current format is just to make sure that we can get the data onto the hands of many devs that might not be the case when we start giving access to rigged and animationready full head models based on customer scan data hope that clarifies  permalinkembedsaveparentgive gold–moonracer  point points points  months ago  childit is good to see people stepping up to the challenge it is only a matter of time before this becomes marketable a few issues i see are there needs to be a widely used avatar format for this to work which is a big problem having a hidef d scan of my facebody is only as useful as the  of software on the market i can use it in preparing for the moment when someone steals another users avatar for scamminggriefing steal a users account and face and walk into an online corporate meeting permalinkembedsavegive gold–tiivikwolfprint ds  points point points  months ago  childrenstandardisation must be nailed indeed fortunately we have already created a workflow which can turn our highres scans into standard heads now we need solid middleware that will speak to the gameengine and you are absolutely correct about security those are the issues that must be addressed carefully permalinkembedsaveparentgive
