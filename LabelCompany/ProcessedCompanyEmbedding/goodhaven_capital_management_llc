our approach  goodhaven capital management    choose a page about us our approach managed accounts linkspdfs contact us our approach the concepts and investment philosophy used by the principals of goodhaven in managing your money are relatively simple to explain but much harder to execute first and foremost we try to behave in a businesslike fashion and analyze securities from a business owner or lender point of view this means always trying to determine a range of “intrinsic values” for the securities we identify as candidates for purchase as ben graham left the “dean” of security analysis and one of warren buffett’s professors at columbia university in new york once wrote “investment is most intelligent when it is most businesslike” we try to embed graham’s concepts of intrinsic value and “margin of safety” into everything we do for our clients and shareholders we define intrinsic value is defined as the price that a securityholder would receive if a company were sold to a knowledgeable buyer or the proceeds that would be received upon liquidation or reorganization of the enterprise we define margin of safety is defined as the discount from intrinsic value at which a security may be purchased value investing becomes a process whereby the portfolio manager is constantly trying to identify intrinsic values and maximize the associated margin of safety we think of these concepts as trying to find dollar bills in the stock or bond markets and then buy them for less than a dollar – preferably far less in any investment a larger margin of safety implies a lower chance of significant loss and a greater potential profit unlike many investors goodhaven cannot be put in a simple style box we prefer companies that grow but will sometimes buy one whose revenues are shrinking we prefer to invest in common stocks but will sometimes venture into other security types and we prefer easily understandable businesses but sometimes buy those with more complicated financial statements however the common theme in all our investments is that we are constantly trying to get much more than we give hint if you’re looking for a bargain you want to spend your time looking where there is fear or disinterest not where popularity or momentum rules supreme we are not stock market strategists technical analysts or fortune tellers that does not mean we are immunized from considerations of external economic factors or volatility in markets or individual securities but our primary concern with these issues is about the risks they present not their predictive power we don’t mind volatility but detest large risk which we define as the chance that we can permanently lose money in our decades of experience we have found almost nobody with an ability to predict the course of markets with shortterm success over a long period of time our experience suggests that time is better spent trying to position ourselves to react to events instead of trying to predict them accordingly we may have a significant cash or equivalent position when valuations seem stretched and are likely to employ those reserves during times of significant stress in markets or individual securities lastly we believe that wide diversification is a hedge against ignorance we manage accounts with prudent concentration believing that it is better to own fewer securities about which your knowledge is substantial than a much longer list where your knowledge is cursory although it should be obvious to most investors if you want to outperform an index over time your portfolio can’t

diversification than a gsap account the ability to buy stressed or illiquid assets such as “junk bonds” bank debt and other securities and the ability to partly or fully hedge portions of the portfolio notwithstanding the above we expect the bulk of the portfolio to be invested in common stocks although from time to time we may have cash reserves as described above goodhaven capital
