sciences want exome sent to you daily meet the contributors → john maraganore from “prototypical geek” to canny alnylam chief ben fidler september th  benthefidler xconomylike us xconomy boston —  john maraganore opened up an envelope in  that changed his life inside were the results of the pivotal study of an anticoagulant drug maraganore had created in the lab it was the star prospect for maraganore’s employer biogen if the drug bivalirudin worked biogen might have its first product—and maraganore the glory of designing it the news however was bad bivalirudin failed the study biogen jettisoned the drug altogether and moved on to become the world’s leader in multiple sclerosis treatments and maraganore the classic geek scientist obsessed with basic research would never work at the lab bench again instead biogen leadership forced him down a new path one that would transform him into a successful biotech business executive he would authorize strategic decisions weigh multibillion dollar deals handle the fates of hundreds of employees—and even find a way to bring bivalirudin to market and ultimately he would become one of the driving forces behind a new highrisk and highreward field of science—rna interference rnai—that aims to “silence” diseasecausing genes indeed  years later maraganore now is synonymous with rnai he’s the ceo of cambridge mabased alnylam pharmaceuticals nasdaq alny which has grown from fledgling startup to the biggest rnai operation in the world and soon another crucial envelope is coming for maraganore after burning through more than  million of invested dollars and enduring a series of highs and lows alnylam is running its first phase  trial with a drug called patisiran the drug treats a rare condition that causes proteins to clump up in the body and stifle organs successful results will turn alnylam from an expensive yearlong science project into a real revenuegenerating pharmaceutical company with many more opportunities—and help validate the whole field of rnai if patisiran fails the chorus of those who doubt rnai will grow louder “that’s fine” maraganore says “that’s just the price of leading an effort” indeed maraganore has never played it safe he could have followed the path of his father and brother and become a doctor with a stable income he chose highrisk research instead he could’ve stayed at biogen or later millennium pharmaceuticals—established stable drugmakers instead he chose to lead a tiny startup pursuing a new field of science he could have kept quiet when novartis backed out of rnai research earlier this year instead he publicly blasted big pharma and criticized its ability to innovate kevin starr “john is very much not riskaverse that’s always been his mo as a scientist—he was a very bold scientist” says third rock ventures partner kevin starr a longtime friend of maraganore a colleague at biogen and millennium and a fellow alnylam boardmember “alnylam has survived because he’s looked at it as one of his children and he’s put all that passion in there” still maraganore is unfailingly selfeffacing he’s quick to point out his failures there’s been “tons” like deals he decided against that burned him down the road or weaknesses like running the daytoday operations of a company he’ll often point out others who are more qualified than he is to do a job—even if in potential merger discussions that may cost him his own he’ll promote people past him starr for instance started out as his employee but became his boss after a promotion maraganore endorsed he loves travel and good food a glass of wine and a cigar and a game of pool “john’s a fun guy” starr says ”and he’s been successful by being a giver” and by pursuing his passions despite the risks maraganore pronounced mareaganoree was born in  in chicago the son of two greek immigrants and the second of three children the family started out in a bedroom townhouse in rogers park on the far north side when maraganore’s father’s career as a pathologist took off they were able to move to the upscale suburb of skokie when maraganore was about eight years old much was expected of maraganore and his older brother and younger sister “we were driven to do important things” he recalls if he got an a at school his parents wanted to know why wasn’t it an a get a b god forbid it was tough on maraganore because school didn’t come easy to him as it does for some of those kids that can slack off and ace a test “they held you to high standards and they were hard drivers it was all around ‘you need to do better you need to work harder’” he says of his parents “i had to work like a dog but it did create a real work ethic in me that i have to this day” while he sheepishly acknowledges a “dungeons  dragons” phase maraganore took on all sorts of additional extracurricular tasks like the chemistry club chess club and yearbook editor he finished high school near the top of his class maraganore’s father believed that being a doctor meant stability and a good life and pushed his children towards medicine the unspoken expectation according to maraganore was that father and sons would open and run a clinic together his father would bring things home from his lab for his kids like a microscope that a young maraganore became obsessed with “propaganda” maraganore jokes today maraganore also remembers spending summers as an adolescent working in his father’s pathology lab testing patient samples he learned a lot of lab basics—pipetting what to do and not to do with blood—and performed radioimmunoassays tests to measure say hormone levels in the blood and serum chemistry tests “that was one of the great things about having a pathologist for a father” maraganore says “it was just a great learning experience” maraganore became a certifiable science geek his favorite class was biology he volunteered at his high school biology lab staying late to set up experiments for the next day or stocking and maintaining the lab’s saltwater fish tank he’d visit chicago’s museum of science and industry and speed to the human biology exhibit he’d collect water samples from different places and bring them to his microscope to look at paramecia or hydras “i’d look at the microscope and sort of look at these little tiny organisms and so forth or a slide and look at cells and it’s just fascinating right” he says “it’s so beautiful” maraganore’s brother dutifully became a doctor a neurologist but maraganore strayed from the prescribed path in his sophomore year at the university of chicago intending to study medicine he began doing basic research in a lab under biochemistry professor bob heinrikson he purified and characterized proteins specifically snake venom enzymes he recalls being motivated by the idea of exploring things “nobody else in the world was exploring” “just like i enjoyed it when i was a kid looking at the microscope i was doing it as an older kid in a basic research lab” he says he began to aim for a career as a university scientist he sped through grad school also at the university of chicago getting his phd in biochemistry in just two years though he claims it was blind “luck” because of … next page » single pagecurrently on page     ben fidler is xconomys deputy biotechnology editor you can email him at bfidlerxconomycom follow

maraganore ceo of alnylam pharmaceuticals in his office in cambridge keith bedfordthe boston globe twitter facebook linkedin email doximity republish print b iotech is a risky business where roughly  percent of grand ideas fall flat and billiondollar failures are commonplace so it’s fitting that the industry’s selfappointed spokesman is the blackjackplaying ceo of a fastgrowing company one about to find out whether its futuristic science can make an actual product john maraganore is unafraid of the spotlight the yearold head of kendall square’s alnylam pharmaceuticals is a regular on cnbc appearing on camera in his characteristic designer glasses and colorful suits mostly he talks about his company’s efforts to develop genesilencing drugs but he doesn’t hesitate to defend the virtues — and condemn the sins — of his whole industry even though his company has yet to win marketing approval for a single product last year when martin shkreli’s turing pharmaceuticals raised the price of an old drug by more than  percent maraganore was one of the first biotech executives to castigate the move advertisement biotech is “about innovation patients and stcentury medicines” he said on live television not “repricing drugs from the s to make a profit” it wasn’t a calculated statement maraganore told stat he got the invitation as he was preparing his kids for school and he was on the air an hour later speaking on behalf of drug companies around the country “if there are actors in the biotech community out there poisoning the well by creating a negative environment it hurts us” maraganore said in his cambridge office sitting beneath a fiatsized poster of a drug he developed at another company “it hurts alnylam it hurts any other developmentstage company” read more for drug companies the martin shkreli nightmare isn’t over yet maraganore’s strongest words however are often saved for alnylam’s competitors last year when rival firm arrowhead pharmaceuticals acquired some genesilencing assets from novartis one of alnylam’s former partners maraganore dismissed the deal as “buying a bag of stale potato chips” and that’s what he’ll say on the record within alnylam he tends to be more candid “he will say exactly what he thinks about something someone else did and people love that” said rachel meyers the company’s vice president of research “but there’s been many many times when the eyes go around the room and everyone looks at each other and thinks ‘ok did he just say that’” it’s a risk as ceo of a publicly traded biotech to weigh in on issues outside your company in the drug industry stocks often rise and fall on rumor and conjecture speaking unguarded in a fickle market can seem like tempting fate but maraganore said he’s never heard complaints from other company executives and alnylam’s investors or board members have never asked him to tone it down he’s been “a very positive force in the whole biotech community” said phillip sharp a molecular biologist at the massachusetts institute of technology who cofounded alnylam in  and continues to sit on the company’s board and people around the industry including executives at rival firms all praised his ability to put a human face on biotech dr sean harper head of research at biotech giant amgen said maraganore has helped raise the industry’s profile and dr jay bradner the top scientist at novartis called maraganore a “legend” whose decadeplus dedication to alnylam demonstrates “the most credible type of scientific leadership” today alnylam is worth about  billion employs more than  people and pays its ceo about  million in cash and stock but when maraganore left the cancer drug maker millennium pharmaceuticals to become alnylam’s ceo in its early days the company had just a handful of employees and a few million dollars to its name read more what’s in a biotech name how drug startups choose their brand kevin starr then millennium’s chief financial officer thought his friend was taking too big a risk alnylam’s bedrock technology had been around for just a few years a blip in the world of science and the company had only data from mice to back up its ambitions but starr now a member of alnylam’s board soon realized the “nerdy scientist” he once knew had grown into a business leader he said and the change was visible maraganore as former millennium ceo mark levin put it had gone from a lab dweller with “khaki pants halfway up his chest” to something “more like a model out of versace than someone out of boys’ life” maraganore’s risktaking streak dates back to his prealnylam days at millennium where he was an executive vice president quite fond of making friendly bets levin remembers a particularly lucrative meeting in  when maraganore unprompted made the bold assertion that every  years the month of february stretched to  days “and everybody’s like ‘john that’s not right’” levin said sign up for the readout a guide to whats new in biotech please enter a valid email address but this being a presmartphone world in which such claims could not be instantly checked maraganore held onto his version of planetary science and he dared his colleagues to put some money on it maraganore lost  that night recalled levin who together with starr and another millennium alum went on to launch and run third rock ventures a boston firm dedicated to bankrolling startups maraganore’s most recent gamble betting on an unconventional approach to treating disease is looking more promising biotech companies have long developed humanized antibodies that block the errant proteins behind many diseases but alnylam’s technology goes one step upstream tinkering with rna to stop those proteins from being produced in the first place read more clash of scientific titans crispr hits the courts with money and prestige at stake now after spending about  billion over  years alnylam has reached the final stage of development with its top prospect a treatment for a rare lifethreatening disease that results from the buildup of misfolded proteins and the company is so confident the drug is going to work that it just broke ground on a huge manufacturing facility south of boston which is slated to come online in  — right when alnylam expects to win regulatory approval “we’re making those allin decisions right now” maraganore said both levin and starr said they continue to see maraganore’s growing appetite for risk first hand each and every year all three make an annual pilgrimage to las vegas for a weekend of marathon blackjack games with a few hours of sleep peppered in a tradition that dates back  years they all bet “big stakes” maraganore said though he declined to disclose just how those bets pan out “you know i’m pretty
