aloha a new reit focused on hawaii  alexander  baldwin inc nysealex  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»aloha a new reit focused on hawaiijul  about alexander  alex brad thomas dividend growth investing reits newsletter provider valuemarketplacereit beatsummaryi’m not complaining about adding alex to my intelligent reit lab in fact i’m excited that i can finally visit hawaii and soak up some fun in the sunsection  exchanges have been a part of the internal revenue code since i believe that alex will trade at a much higher multiple if the company can remove some of the complexity riska few years ago i was in san diego meeting with the ceo of realty income o one of my interview questions was pertaining to the company’s geographic footprint and i was specifically interested in knowing why realty income owned buildings in  states and not  tom lewis a former ceo of realty income explained to me that hawaii was the sole state with no buildings owned by o and that is also the case today as it turns out lewis retired from realty income in  after  years at the company  years as the ceo he moved to hawaii where he stays active playing golf and serving as a director at sunstone hotel investors sho lewis has deep roots in hawaii as he is a graduate of the st louis in honolulu founded in  and also hawaiis chaminade university this week lewis adds a second director position to his resume and this one closes the loop regarding my questioning years ago in which i asked lewis why he had not planted a seed in hawaii in a recent investor presentation alexander  baldwin inc alex disclosed its plan to convert to a reit effective for the taxable year ending december   lewis is being added as a director in addition to james mead hired as alex’s new cfo mead succeeds paul ito whos remaining as senior vp finance and treasurer for a transition through years end mead was most recently cfo for sl green realty slg of course i’m not complaining about adding alex to my intelligent reit lab in fact i’m excited that i can finally visit hawaii and soak up some fun in the sun i’ll have to commence another “mystery shopper” article and inspect alex’s portfolio in addition to taubman’s tco mall in waikiki international market place here’s my previous mystery shopper article on tco here creating wealth via the  exchange tax code you may recall that i previously wrote an article on consolidatedtomoka land cto in which i explained that the daytonabased company has utilized the likekind exchange vehicle referred to as the section  irs code over the years cto has held the significant majority of its portfolio of land holdings which are used in agricultural operations for most of its over year history and as a result the companys book basis in the majority of these assets is very low because of the low basis in land holdings dispositions of land typically would generate large taxable gains utilizing the likekind exchange structure allows cto to defer the related income taxes on these gains and reinvest nearly all the net sales proceeds of the qualifying transaction into income producing properties a while back i also penned an article examining the potential impacts related to the potential elimination of the irc  taxdeferred exchange laws section  exchanges have been a part of the internal revenue code since  and have historically been used by sellers of commercial real estate to defer federal and state capital gains taxes as well as recapture taxes similar to cto alex has also been successful with utilizing the  exchange code as a method for rolling capital gains from raw land into incomeproducing properties alex has an interesting history that goes all of the way back to  when samuel thomas alexander and henry perrine baldwin sons of pioneer missionaries met in lahaina maui they grew up together became close friends and went on to develop a sugargrowing partnership that spanned generations and left an indelible mark on hawaii as the story goes in  the young men – alexander was  baldwin  – were ready to launch their own business they purchased  acres of bush ranch in the sunnyside area of makawao on maui for  to grow sugar cane the following year they paid  for an additional  acres that same year the partners planted sugar cane on their land marking the birth of what would become alexander  baldwin inc over the next thirty years the two men became agents for nearly a dozen plantations and expanded their plantation interests by acquiring hawaiian commercial  sugar company and kahului railroad in  alexander and baldwin formalized their partnership by incorporating their sugar business as the paia plantation also known at various times as samuel t alexander  co haleakala sugar co and alexander  baldwin plantation by spring of  ab had outgrown its partnership organization and plans were made to incorporate the company allowing the company to increase capitalization and facilitate expansion what started off as a partnership between two young men with the purchase of  acres in maui for  has grown into a business with  billion in assets including approximately  acres of land after the passing of the founders alexander  baldwin continued to expand their sugar operations by acquiring additional land developing essential water resources and investing in shipping to bring supplies to hawaii and transport sugar to the us mainland markets these resources originally acquired for agricultural purposes would eventually become the foundation of ab’s strength and success today today alex is a premier hawaii real estate company that owns operates and manages  million square feet of retail industrial and office space primarily in hawaii and on the us mainland alex is also the largest owner of grocerydruganchored retail centers in hawaii the hawaii footprint extends beyond commercial real estate alex is the fourth largest private landowner in hawaii with operations on  acres of land primarily on maui and kauai and hawaii’s largest materials and paving company alex is a year old company rooted in hawaii land heritage leveraging deep local knowledge and unique assets for longterm growth breaking down the portfolio alex’s commercial real estate portfolio consists of  million square feet of hawaii commercial real estate excluding ground leases primarily oahu groceryanchored strip retail properties the hawaii retail portfolio is over  million square feet that is  leased the hawaii industrial portfolio is  square feet and is  leased the hawaii office portfolio consists of  million square feet and is  leased the company also has  acres of ground leases alex also owns  mainland properties consisting of retail office and industrial – the combined assets total  million square feet and are  leased here’s a snapshot of alex’s top tenants alex’s reit structure will facilitate growth in hawaii where the company can best leverage its market knowledge and experience to create shareholder value alex intends to bring its asset management inhouse to enhance accountabilitycoordination and costeffectiveness by internalizing property management alex plans to take a more strategic approach to leasing assets and upgrading technology to better understand tenant and consumer needs and wants alex has many repositioning and redevelopment opportunities within its portfolio to increase noi here’s a snapshot of the hawaii portfolio alex prefers grocerydruganchored shopping centers and industrial properties many of which represent highbarriertoentry assets that boasts significant supply constraints keeps fundamentals strong alex has budgeted  million for new commercial property acquisitions in  for equity alex will continue to monetize sales of existing land inventory over the last  years alex has sold  acres at an average price of  per acre alex has enjoyed favorable q momentum with six closed sales –  million gross revenue – the collection ka milo mbp ii land with  new binding contracts in q–  million gross revenue – kamalani keala o wailea kukui’ula ka milo and land alex’s agriculture business is not expected to be a driver of nearterm profitability and the objective is to deploy former sugar plantation lands in viable agricultural uses as quickly as possible alex also has a materials and construction business that is essentially a paving operation in q the business generated profits of  million and adjusted ebitda of  million this business represents a small portion of alex’s overall business operations the balance sheet alex has a long history of maintaining discipline within its balance sheet as of q alex’s debt to equity was just under  and the company had  million of liquidity available on its revolver net debttoebitda was x here’s an illustrative example of the impact conversionrelated activities on ab’s capital structure as of march   assuming a  million cash portion of a  million special distribution surfs up my initial review of alex as a reit is good and i would give the company a b as noted the recent appointments of tom lewis and james mead bring significant credibility to the platform hopefully lewis can bring some of that “monthly dividend magic” to the table at some point photo source i decided not to give alex an “a” because i am concerned with complexity risk specifically the paving operation i understand the value of the enterprise but i’m not sold on the inclusion of the paving business as a taxable subsidiary also i would like to see alex become a “pure play” reit and sell off the noncore properties to focus  on necessitybased retail tom lewis knows the benefit of becoming a “lowcost leader” and i believe that alex will trade at a much higher multiple if the company can remove some of the complexity risk my biggest concern is the  exchange tax code as noted above there is a possibility that congress could eliminate the  tool and this would have an impact on alex’s ability to raise cheap equity it’s not an absolute deal killer as alex could participate in jv development in lieu of likekind exchanges to create value ultimately the two most important lessons that i have learned in
