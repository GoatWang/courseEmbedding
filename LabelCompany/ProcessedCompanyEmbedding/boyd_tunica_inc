inc boyd gaming is one of the countrys leading casino operators the company operates more than  gaming entertainment properties located in nevada and several other us states besides nevada boyd gaming has casinos in illinois indiana iowa kansas louisiana mississippi and new jersey most of the companys properties are sprawling resort hotels that feature pools full casinos restaurants shops and onsite entertainment options for guests in addition to its casinos boyd gaming owns and operates a travel agency in hawaii boyd gaming was established in  operations the companys las vegas locals segment accounted for  of revenue during fiscal  it consists of six casinos which include gold coast hotel and casino the orleans hotel and casino sams town hotel and gambling hall and suncoast hotel and casino the companys midwest and south properties consist of four dockside riverboat casinos one racing and two bargebased casinos that operate in four states in the midwest and southern us this segment brought in almost  of boyds revenue during fiscal  sales and marketing the companys advertising and marketing promotion costs were about  million in fiscal  boyd works to build loyalty with locals since the casinos that are not on the las vegas strip are not as popular with tourists and convention attendees financial performance boyds revenue was about  billion in fiscal  that was a decrease of  compared to the prior fiscal period the decrease in revenue was mainly from the deconsolidation of borgata as revenue from all other segments increased during the year in fiscal  boyds net income was  million after the company claimed a net loss in fiscal  the improvement was due to decreased operating expenses the companys cash from operating activities was  million at the end of fiscal  that was an increase of  compared to fiscal  due to changes in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accounts receivables strategy many of boyds properties are dated and in need of upgrades or total renovation it will take large capital investments to bring the companys facilities up to modern standards for example boyd is spending  million on expansion of its delta downs racetrack casino hotel in vinton louisiana the company is also spending more than  million on upgrades and renovations to its las vegas and regional properties with plans to add  more restaurants in
