inc sindhu pradeep juniper networks incoverviewpradeep sindhu through the company he founded juniper networks inc helped revolutionize broadband access speed and reliability to internet service providers with the high–speed router hardware that he developed and marketed in only five years juniper became a leader in network technology boasting an impressive –percent share of the multi–billion router core market and standing as the only serious competition for networking leader cisco systems sindhus simultaneous involvement in the control of his company and the development of the m router was a both a business and technological feat the m router which was the same size but four times as powerful than the prototype m was an unprecedented technological achievement that helped juniper become one of the forerunners in its fieldpersonal lifepradeep sindhu is both a husband and a father he has received a number of awards including the technologist of the year award from siliconindia in  his company also received numerous awards including the data communications testers choice award the nikkei industry awards for superiority and pc magazines best internet product awardsindhu was born in  in india in  he graduated with a bachelors degree in technology from the indian institute of technology in india and received a masters degree in electrical engineering from the university of hawaii in  he earned a phd in computer science from carnegie mellon universitys school of computer science sindhu then took a job as a principal scientist at the xerox palo alto research center where he developed design tools for high–speed interconnects for shared–memory multiprocessors he later worked at sun microsystems and was involved in the design and development of suns first high–performance multiprocessor systems family incorporating the ss and sscareer detailsin  while was working at the xerox palo alto research center parc pradeep sindhu formulated the idea to create a new company he saw a growing need for high–end internet routers that was not being met by manufacturers i felt networking was an area with maximum growth potential he told indiatimes we decided to focus on the internet router market because the number of internet users was doubling rapidly and the cost of bandwidth was coming down but the routers that were existing back then were very limited in their capabilitysindhu established juniper networks in  operating the firm from his home he immediately began securing financial support and recruiting experienced professionals renowned venture capitalist vinod khosla former founding ceo of sun microsystems invested  for the formation of the silicon valley–based juniper in a shrewd move sindhu being a technology specialist with no business background soon hired scott kriens as the companys president and ceo he lured the most talented engineers away from his former employers as well as such rivals as sun microsystems xerox parc and cisco in order to create a workforce capable of providing the speed to market required of the complex high–tech products an increase in the number of internet users resulted in more data traffic over the lines and juniper sought to fill the need for faster and more efficient routers the new routers that juniper developed were the most powerful on the market able to transmit high volumes of data for internet and telecommunications companiesin  juniper networks went public its opening price was  per share and by the end of the year it had jumped tenfold to  per share raising  billion for the relatively new companyone of the keys to the companys success was the advanced technology of its products unlike its competitors decade–old recycled technology junos router software was specifically designed for internet use at the heart of each of its m–series router was the internet processor ii asic sindhu described its function on junipers website the internet processor ii asics ability to process packets intelligently with uncompromising performance is unique to juniper networks routers and is the key to enabling smart ip services juniper networks m–series routers powered by the internet processor ii asic and controlled by junos software enable a truly integrated multiservice ip network for the first time in the industrythe fact that the company specialized in one area internet routers and did it better than any other company was another reason that juniper became a leader in its field the third key to junipers success rested in the speed at which it could develop and deliver technology despite its small size juniper was able to execute the difficult task involved in new router technology with greater speed and efficiency the final explanation for junipers meteoric rise to success was that it outsourced all of its manufacturing enabling it to focus  percent on development sindhus role as chief technology officer allowed the entrepreneur to focus wholly on plotting the future of technology at the company as well as participating in actual design and development of products proof of that success in  the company generated  million in revenue one year later this figure jumped more than  percent to  millionchronology pradeep sindhu  born received bachelors degree from iit kanpur received phd in computer science from carnegie mellon university formed juniper networks inc juniper went public juniper generated  million in revenue revenue jumped  percent to  million junipers m router was the fastest on the market juniper acquired micro magic  partnered with blue star to distribute routers in indiain march  after  months of development junipers m router was unveiled as the fastest on the market the new product gave juniper a distinct advantage over its competition the significant thing about this development is that this machine is four times more powerful than the m and is the same size as the m sindhu told the economic times online this is the first time in the history of communications or computing that this has been achieved as companies lined up to order the m such rivals as cisco nortel and lucent rushed to build a similar router though none appeared on the market until early  nearly a year laterjuniper continued to grow and expand raising  billion in early  for acquisitions research and development and marketing it partnered with lm ericsson to produce mobile internet devices and joined with blue star limited to distribute routers in india juniper acquired micro magic a leading integrated circuit solutions company in december while many technology companies including cisco warned of a slowdown in the industry in  juniper raised its yearly forecast by  percent to  billion however as of november  junipers stock was valued at  per share down from the previous years lofty  although it appeared that juniper had joined the other victims of the technology downturn its possibilities for future growth remained bright according to leading researchers the  billion market for high–end routers will soar to  billion by  sindhu believes his company will grow along with itsindhu himself expanded into the field of venture capitalism investing his companys profits into start–ups not unlike juniper networks his native india had emerged as one of the fastest–growing information technology markets having blossomed from  million to nearly  billion in  years sindhu intended to capitalize on indias healthy market also benefiting from the fact that the venture capital business was still in its infancy there vishuni varshney chairman of the indian venture capital association said that of the  billion in venture capital invested in new indian technology start–ups in  most came from us investorssocial and economic impactonly five years after its formation juniper networks became a leader in its field internet routers this business accomplishment was remarkable yet pradeep sindhus scientific contributions have been equally impressive his own groundbreaking work along with that of the specialists that he gathered at juniper pushed the outer limits of technology and set the bar for others in the industry by designing the fastest most advanced products in the least amount of time by far the biggest unsung hero is pradeep sindhu said venture capitalist khosla in interctive week he permanently changed the definition of what a router does and how it is built and got internet protocol on a robust footingsindhu steered his upstart juniper networks into uncharted territory vying with industry giant cisco systems which had a near monopoly in the sector with his vision of producing faster more powerful routers and delivering them more quickly to the market sindhu was able to grab a healthy share of market and change the face of technology in the process building on the success of juniper sindhu quickly dove into the profitable world of venture capitalism funding

expense of cisco systems sales according to businessweek analysts unanimously agreed that junipers boxes were technically superior to ciscos because the hardware does most of the data processing cisco routers still relied on software which often results in slower speeds however cisco provided a broader range of services and support and had an entrenched market position the press often depicted juniper and cisco as a david versus goliath story cisco had grown through acquisitions to be a large generalist vendor for routing equipment in homes businesses and for isps whereas juniper was thought of as the anticisco for being a small company with a narrow focus in january  cisco introduced a suite of router products that businessweek said was intended to challenge junipers increasing marketshare according to businessweek junipers topend router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable cisco products ciscos routers were not expected to erode junipers growing share

the code an analysis of junipers screenos firmware code in december  discovered a backdoor key using dualecdrbg allowing to passively decrypt the traffic encrypted by screenos this backdoor was inserted in the year  into the versions of screenos from r to r and from r to r and gives any user administrative access when using a special master password some analysts claim that this backdoor still exists in screenos stephen checkoway was quoted in wired that if this backdoor was not intentional then in my opinion it’s an amazing coincidence in december  juniper systems announced that they had discovered unauthorized code in the screenos software that underlies their netscreen devices present from  onwards there were two vulnerabilities one was a simple root password backdoor and the other one was changing a point in dualecdrbg so that the attackers presumably had the key to use the preexisting intentional or unintentional kleptographic backdoor in screenos to passively decrypt

juniper controlled onethird of the market for highend core routers mostly at the expense of cisco systems sales according to businessweek analysts unanimously agreed that junipers boxes were technically superior to ciscos because the hardware does most of the data processing cisco routers still relied on software which often results in slower speeds however cisco provided a broader range of services and support and had an entrenched market position the press often depicted juniper and cisco as a david versus goliath story cisco had grown through acquisitions to be a large generalist vendor for routing equipment in homes businesses and for isps whereas juniper was thought of as the anticisco for being a small company with a narrow focus in january  cisco introduced a suite of router products that businessweek said was intended to challenge junipers increasing marketshare according to businessweek junipers topend router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of

in yellow backdoor admin password hidden in the code an analysis of junipers screenos firmware code in december  discovered a backdoor key using dualecdrbg allowing to passively decrypt the traffic encrypted by screenos this backdoor was inserted in the year  into the versions of screenos from r to r and from r to r and gives any user administrative access when using a special master password some analysts claim that this backdoor still exists in screenos stephen checkoway was quoted in wired that if this backdoor was not intentional then in my opinion it’s an amazing coincidence in december  juniper systems announced that they had discovered unauthorized code in the screenos software that underlies their netscreen devices present from  onwards there were two vulnerabilities one was a simple root password backdoor and the other one was changing a point in dualecdrbg so that the attackers presumably had the key to use the preexisting intentional or unintentional kleptographic backdoor in screenos to passively decrypt traffic software defined networkingedit according to a  swot analysis by marketline in recent history juniper has been focusing on softwaredefined networking

sales according to businessweek analysts unanimously agreed that junipers boxes were technically superior to ciscos because the hardware does most of the data processing cisco routers still relied on software which often results in slower speeds however cisco provided a broader range of services and support and had an entrenched market position the press often depicted juniper and cisco as a david versus goliath story cisco had grown through acquisitions to be a large generalist vendor for routing equipment in homes businesses and for isps whereas juniper was thought of as the anticisco for being a small company with a narrow focus in january  cisco introduced a suite of router products that businessweek said was intended to challenge junipers increasing marketshare according to businessweek junipers topend router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable cisco products ciscos routers were not expected to erode junipers growing share of the market but other

the code an analysis of junipers screenos firmware code in december  discovered a backdoor key using dualecdrbg allowing to passively decrypt the traffic encrypted by screenos this backdoor was inserted in the year  into the versions of screenos from r to r and from r to r and gives any user administrative access when using a special master password some analysts claim that this backdoor still exists in screenos stephen checkoway was quoted in wired that if this backdoor was not intentional then in my opinion it’s an amazing coincidence in december  juniper systems announced that they had discovered unauthorized code in the screenos software that underlies their netscreen devices present from  onwards there were two vulnerabilities one was a simple root password backdoor and the other one was changing a point in dualecdrbg so that the attackers presumably had the key to use the preexisting intentional or unintentional kleptographic backdoor in screenos to passively decrypt

juniper controlled onethird of the market for highend core routers mostly at the expense of cisco systems sales according to businessweek analysts unanimously agreed that junipers boxes were technically superior to ciscos because the hardware does most of the data processing cisco routers still relied on software which often results in slower speeds however cisco provided a broader range of services and support and had an entrenched market position the press often depicted juniper and cisco as a david versus goliath story cisco had grown through acquisitions to be a large generalist vendor for routing equipment in homes businesses and for isps whereas juniper was thought of as the anticisco for being a small company with a narrow focus in january  cisco introduced a suite of router products that businessweek said was intended to challenge junipers increasing marketshare according to businessweek junipers topend router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable cisco products ciscos routers were not expected to erode junipers growing share of the market but other companies such as lucent alcatel and startups avici systems and pluris had announced plans to release products that would outpace junipers routers juniper introduced a suite of routers for the network edge that allowed it to compete with cisco junipers edge routers had a  market share two months after release both companies made exaggerated marketing claims juniper promoted its products as stable enough to make it staff bored and cisco announced lab tests from light reading proved its products were superior to juniper whereas the publication itself reached the opposite conclusion by  both companies were repeatedly announcing products with faster specifications than the other in

junipers first major diversification from core routers was when it entered the market for edge routers by acquiring the eseries product family originally known as erx through the purchase of unisphere

in yellow backdoor admin password hidden in the code an analysis of junipers screenos firmware code in december  discovered a backdoor key using dualecdrbg allowing to passively decrypt the traffic encrypted by screenos this backdoor was inserted in the year  into the versions of screenos from r to r and from r to r and gives any user administrative access when using a special master password some analysts claim that this backdoor still exists in screenos stephen checkoway was quoted in wired that if this backdoor was not intentional then in my opinion it’s an amazing coincidence in december  juniper systems announced that they had discovered unauthorized code in the screenos software that underlies their netscreen devices present from  onwards there were two vulnerabilities one was a simple root password backdoor and the other one was changing a point in dualecdrbg so that the attackers presumably had the key to use the preexisting intentional or unintentional kleptographic backdoor in screenos to passively decrypt traffic software defined networkingedit according to a  swot analysis by marketline in recent history juniper has been focusing on softwaredefined networking

sales according to businessweek analysts unanimously agreed that junipers boxes were technically superior to ciscos because the hardware does most of the data processing cisco routers still relied on software which often results in slower speeds however cisco provided a broader range of services and support and had an entrenched market position the press often depicted juniper and cisco as a david versus goliath story cisco had grown through acquisitions to be a large generalist vendor for routing equipment in homes businesses and for isps whereas juniper was thought of as the anticisco for being a small company with a narrow focus in january  cisco introduced a suite of router products that businessweek said was intended to challenge junipers increasing marketshare according to businessweek junipers topend router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable cisco products ciscos routers were not expected to erode junipers growing share of the market but other companies such as lucent alcatel and startups avici systems and pluris had announced plans to release products that would outpace junipers routers juniper introduced a suite of routers for the network edge that allowed it to compete with cisco junipers edge routers had a  market share two months after release both companies made exaggerated marketing claims juniper promoted its products as stable enough to make it staff bored and cisco announced lab tests from light reading proved its products were superior to juniper whereas the publication itself reached the opposite conclusion by  both

inserted in the year  into the versions of screenos from r to r and from r to r and gives any user administrative access when using a special master password some analysts claim that this backdoor still exists in screenos stephen checkoway was quoted in wired that if this backdoor was not intentional then in my opinion it’s an amazing coincidence in december  juniper systems announced that they had discovered unauthorized code in the screenos software that underlies their netscreen devices present from  onwards there were two vulnerabilities one was a simple root password backdoor and the other one was changing a point in dualecdrbg so that the attackers presumably had the key to use the preexisting intentional or unintentional kleptographic backdoor in screenos to passively decrypt

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible
