spaceflight program conducted between projects mercury and apollo gemini started in  and concluded in  the gemini spacecraft carried a twoastronaut crew ten gemini crews flew low earth orbit leo missions between  and  putting the united states in the lead during the cold war space race against the soviet union geminis objective was the development of space travel techniques to support the apollo mission to land astronauts on the moon it performed missions long enough for a trip to the moon and back perfected working outside the spacecraft with extravehicular activity eva and pioneered the orbital maneuvers necessary to achieve space rendezvous and docking with these new techniques proven by gemini apollo could pursue its prime mission without doing these fundamental exploratory operations all gemini flights were launched from launch complex  lc at cape kennedy air force station in florida their launch vehicle was the gemini–titan ii a modified intercontinental ballistic missile icbmnote  gemini was the first program to use the newly built mission control center at the houston manned spacecraft center for flight controlnote  the astronaut corps that supported project gemini included the mercury seven the new nine and the  astronaut class during the program three astronauts died in air crashes during training including the prime crew for gemini  this mission was performed by the backup crew the only time that had happened in nasas history to date gemini was robust enough that the united states air force planned to use it for the manned orbital laboratory mol program which was later canceled geminis chief designer jim chamberlin also made detailed plans for cislunar and lunar landing missions in late  he believed gemini could perform lunar operations before project apollo and cost less nasas administration did not approve those plans in  mcdonnelldouglas proposed a big gemini that could have been used to shuttle up to  astronauts to the planned space stations in the apollo applications project aap the only aap project funded was skylab – which used existing spacecraft and hardware – thereby eliminating the need for big gemini contents

notes  citations  books  articles  external links program origins and objectivesedit after the existing apollo program was chartered by president john f kennedy on may   to land men on the moon it became evident to nasa officials that a followon to the mercury program was required to develop certain spaceflight capabilities in support of apollo specifically jim chamberlin the head of engineering at the space task group stg was already assigned to start working on a bridge program between mercury and apollo in february  he presented two initial versions of gemini at a nasa retreat at wallops island in march  scale models of mercury mark ii were shown in july  at mcdonnell aircraft corporations offices in st louis nasa approved project gemini on december   the mcdonnell corporation was contracted to build it on december   when it was publicly announced on january   it was formally rechristened project gemini gemini in latin means twins or double which reflected that the spacecraft would hold two astronauts gemini is also the name of the third constellation of the zodiac and its twin stars castor and pollux the major objectives were to demonstrate endurance of humans and equipment in spaceflight for extended periods at least eight days required for a moon landing to a maximum of two weeks to effect rendezvous and docking with another vehicle and to maneuver the combined spacecraft using the propulsion system of the target vehicle to demonstrate extravehicular activity eva or spacewalks outside the protection of the spacecraft and to evaluate the astronauts ability to perform tasks there to perfect techniques of atmospheric reentry and touchdown at a preselected location on landnote  teamedit the twocrew member carrying gemini capsule was designed by a canadian jim chamberlin he was previously the chief aerodynamicist on avro canadas avro arrow fighter interceptor program chamberlin joined nasa along with  senior avro engineers after cancellation of the arrow program and became head of the us space task group’s engineering division in charge of gemini the prime contractor was mcdonnell aircraft corporation which was also the prime contractor for the project mercury capsule astronaut gus grissom was heavily involved in the development and design of the gemini spacecraft the other mercury astronauts dubbed the gemini spacecraft the gusmobile grissom writes in his posthumous  book gemini that the realization of project mercurys end and the unlikelihood of his having another flight in that program prompted him to focus all of his efforts on the upcoming gemini program the gemini program was managed by the manned spacecraft center located in houston texas under direction of the office of manned space flight nasa headquarters washington dc dr george e mueller associate administrator of nasa for manned space flight served as acting director of the gemini program william c schneider deputy director of manned space flight for mission operations served as mission director on all gemini flights beginning with gemini a guenter wendt was a mcdonnell engineer who supervised launch preparations for both the mercury and gemini programs and would go on to do the same when the apollo program launched crews his team was responsible for completion of the complex pad closeout procedures just prior to spacecraft launch and he was the last person the astronauts would see prior to closing the hatch the astronauts appreciated his taking absolute authority over and responsibility for the condition of the spacecraft and developed a goodhumored rapport with him spacecraftedit a cutaway illustration of the gemini spacecraft nasa selected mcdonnell aircraft which had been the prime contractor for the project mercury capsule in  to build the gemini capsule the first of which was delivered in  the spacecraft was  feet  inches  m long and  feet  m wide with a launch weight varying from  to  pounds  to  kg the gemini crew capsule referred to as the reentry module was essentially an enlarged version of the mercury capsule unlike mercury the retrorockets electrical power propulsion systems oxygen and water were located in a detachable adapter module behind the reentry module a major design improvement in gemini was to locate all internal spacecraft systems in modular components which could be independently tested and replaced when necessary without removing or disturbing other already tested components reentry moduleedit many components in the capsule itself were reachable through their own small access doors unlike mercury gemini used completely solidstate electronics and its modular design made it easy to repair geminis emergency launch escape system did not use an escape tower powered by a solidfuel rocket but instead used aircraftstyle ejection seats the tower was heavy and complicated and nasa engineers reasoned that they could do away with it as the titan iis hypergolic propellants would burn immediately on contact a titan ii booster explosion had a smaller blast effect and flame than on the cryogenically fueled atlas and saturn ejection seats were sufficient to separate the astronauts from a malfunctioning launch vehicle at higher altitudes where the ejection seats could not be used the astronauts would return inside the spacecraft which would separate from the launch vehicle the main proponent of using ejection seats was james chamberlin head of the engineering division of nasas space force task group chamberlin had never liked the mercury escape tower and wished to use a simpler alternative that would also reduce weight he reviewed several films of atlas and titan ii icbm failures which he used to estimate the approximate size of a fireball produced by an exploding launch vehicle and from this he gauged that the titan ii would produce a much smaller explosion thus the spacecraft could get away with ejection seats maxime faget the designer of the mercury les was on the other hand lessthanenthusiastic about this setup aside from the possibility of the ejection seats seriously injuring the astronauts they would also only be usable for about  seconds after liftoff by which point the booster would be attaining mach  speed and ejection would no longer be possible he was also concerned about the astronauts being launched through the titans exhaust plume if they ejected inflight and later added that the best thing about gemini was that they never had to make an escape gemini was the first astronautcarrying spacecraft to include an onboard computer the gemini guidance computer to facilitate management and control of mission maneuvers this computer sometimes called the gemini spacecraft onboard computer obc was very similar to the saturn launch vehicle digital computer the gemini guidance computer weighed  pounds  kg its core memory had  addresses each containing a bit word composed of three bit syllables all numeric data was bit twoscomplement integers sometimes used as fixedpoint numbers either stored in the first two syllables of a word or in the accumulator instructions always with a bit opcode and  bits of operand could go in any syllable unlike mercury the gemini used inflight radar and an artificial horizon—devices similar to those used in the aviation industry gemini paraglider during tests at edwards air force base in august  the original intention for gemini was to land on solid ground instead of at sea using a rogallo wing rather than a parachute with the crew seated upright controlling the forward motion of the craft to facilitate this the airfoil did not attach just to the nose of the craft but to an additional attachment point for balance near the heat shield this cord was covered by a strip of metal which ran between the twin hatches this design was ultimately dropped and parachutes were used to make a sea landing as in mercury the capsule was suspended at an angle closer to horizontal so that a side of the heat shield contacted the water first this eliminated the need for the landing bag cushion used in the mercury capsule adapter moduleedit the adapter module in turn was separated into a retro module and an equipment module retro moduleedit the retro module contained four solidfuel tem stare retrorockets each spherical in shape except for its rocket nozzle which were structurally attached to two beams that reached across the diameter of the retro module crossing at right angles in the center reentry began with the retrorockets firing one at a time abort procedures at certain periods during liftoff would cause them to fire at the same time thrusting the descent module away from the titan rocket equipment moduleedit gemini was equipped with an orbit attitude and maneuvering system oams containing sixteen thrusters for translation control in all three perpendicular axes forwardbackward leftright updown in addition to attitude control pitch yaw and roll angle orientation as in mercury translation control allowed changing orbital inclination and altitude necessary to perform space rendezvous with other craft and docking with the agena target vehicle atv with its own rocket engine which could be used to perform greater orbit changes early shortduration missions had their electrical power supplied by batteries later endurance missions used the first fuel cells in manned spacecraft gemini was in some regards more advanced than apollo because the latter program began almost a year earlier it became known as a pilots spacecraft due to its assortment of jet fighterlike features in no small part due to gus grissoms influence over the design and it was at this point where the american manned space program clearly began showing its superiority over that of the soviet union with long duration flight rendezvous and extravehicular capabilitynote  the soviet union during this period was developing the soyuz spacecraft intended to take cosmonauts to the moon but political and technical problems began to get in the way leading to the ultimate end of their manned lunar program launch vehicleedit main article titan ii glv the titan ii had debuted in  as the air forces secondgeneration icbm to replace the atlas by using hypergolic fuels it could be stored for long periods of time and be easily readied for launch in addition to being a simpler design with fewer components the only caveat being that the propellant mix nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine was extremely toxic compared to the atlass liquid oxygenrp however the titan had considerable difficulty being manrated due to early problems with pogo oscillation the launch vehicle used a radio guidance system that was unique to launches from cape kennedy astronautsedit astronauts white and mcdivitt inside the gemini  spacecraft  gemini  prime crew and other astronauts at prelaunch breakfast  deke slayton as director of flight crew operations had

selectionedit in late  slayton selected shepard and stafford for gemini  mcdivitt and white for gemini  and schirra and young for gemini  which was to be the first agena rendezvous mission the backup crew for gemini  was grissom and borman who were also slated for gemini  to be the first longduration mission finally conrad and lovell were assigned as the backup crew for gemini  delays in the production of the agena target vehicle caused the first rearrangement of the crew rotation the schirra and young mission was bumped to gemini  and they became the backup crew for shepard and stafford grissom and borman then had their longduration mission assigned to gemini  the second rearrangement occurred when shepard developed ménières disease an inner ear problem grissom was then moved to command gemini  slayton felt that young was a better personality match with grissom and switched stafford and young finally slayton tapped cooper to command the longduration gemini  again for reasons of compatibility he moved conrad from backup commander of gemini  to pilot of gemini  and borman to backup command of gemini  finally he assigned armstrong and elliot see to be the backup crew for gemini  the third rearrangement of crew assignment occurred when slayton felt that see wasnt up to the physical demands of eva on gemini  he reassigned see to be the prime commander of gemini  and put scott as pilot of gemini  and charles bassett as the pilot of gemini  the fourth and final rearrangement of the gemini crew assignment occurred after the deaths of see and bassett when their trainer jet crashed coincidentally into a mcdonnell building which held their gemini  capsule in st louis the backup crew of stafford and cernan was then moved up to the new prime crew of the redesignated gemini a lovell and aldrin were moved from being the backup crew of gemini  to be the backup crew of gemini  this cleared the way through the crew rotation for lovell and aldrin to become the prime crew of gemini  along with the deaths of grissom white and roger chaffee in the fire of apollo  this final arrangement helped determine the makeup of the first seven apollo crews and who would be in position for a chance to be the first to walk on the moon missionsedit gemini mission control in houston during gemini  in  and  two gemini missions were flown without crews to test out systems and the heat shield these were followed by ten flights with crews in  and  all were launched by titan ii launch vehicles some highlights from the gemini program edward h white became the first american to make an extravehicular activity eva or space walk on june   during gemini  gemini  demonstrated the day endurance necessary for an apollo lunar mission with the first use of fuel cells to generate its electrical power gemini a and  accomplished the first space rendezvous in december  and gemini  set a day endurance record gemini  achieved the first space docking with an unmanned agena target vehicle gemini  set a manned earth orbital altitude record of  nautical miles  km in september  using the propulsion system of its agena target vehicle this record still stands as of  edwin buzz aldrin on gemini  became the first space traveller to prove that useful work could be done outside a spacecraft without lifethreatening exhaustion rendezvous in orbit is not a straightforward maneuver should a spacecraft increase its speed to catch up with another the result is that it goes into a higher and slower orbit and the distance thereby increases the right procedure is to slow down and go to a lower orbit first and then later to increase speed and go to the same orbit as the other to practice these maneuvers special rendezvous and docking simulators were built for the astronauts edward

alameda california proposed extensions and applicationsedit advanced geminiedit main article advanced gemini mcdonnell aircraft the main contractor for mercury and gemini was also one of the original bidders on the prime contract for apollo but lost out to north american aviation mcdonnell later sought to extend the gemini program by proposing a derivative which could be used to fly a cislunar mission and even achieve a manned lunar landing earlier and at less cost than apollo but these proposals were rejected by nasa a range of applications were considered for advanced gemini missions including military flights space station crew and logistics delivery and lunar flights the lunar proposals ranged from reusing the docking systems developed for the agena target vehicle on more powerful upper stages such as the centaur which could propel the spacecraft to the moon to complete modifications of the gemini to enable it to land on the lunar surface its applications would have ranged from manned lunar flybys before apollo was ready to providing emergency shelters or rescue for stranded apollo crews or even replacing the apollo program some of the advanced gemini proposals used offtheshelf gemini spacecraft unmodified from the original program while others featured modifications to allow the spacecraft to carry more crew dock with space stations visit the moon and perform other mission objectives other modifications considered included the addition of wings or a parasail to the spacecraft in order to enable it to make a horizontal landing big geminiedit main article big gemini big gemini or big g was another proposal by mcdonnell douglas made in august  it was intended to provide largecapacity allpurpose access to space including missions that ultimately used apollo or the space shuttle the study was performed to generate a preliminary definition of a logistic spacecraft derived from gemini that would be used to resupply an orbiting space station landlanding at a preselected site and refurbishment and reuse were design requirements two baseline spacecraft were defined a nineman minimum modification version of the gemini b called minmod big g and a man advanced concept having the same exterior geometry but with new stateoftheart subsystems called advanced big gcitation needed three launch vehiclessaturn ib titan iiim and saturn int sicsivb were investigated for use with the spacecraft military applicationsedit the air force had an interest in the gemini system and decided to use its own modification of the spacecraft as the crew vehicle for the manned orbital laboratory to this end the gemini  spacecraft was refurbished and flown again atop a mockup of the mol sent into space by a titan iiic this was the first time a spacecraft went into space twice the usaf also had the notion of adapting the gemini spacecraft for military applications such as crude observation of the ground no specialized reconnaissance camera could be carried and practicing making rendezvous with suspicious satellites this project was called blue gemini the usaf did not like the fact that gemini would have to be recovered by the us navy so they intended for blue gemini eventually to use the airfoil and land on three skids carried over from the original design of gemini at first some within nasa welcomed sharing of the cost with the usaf but it was later agreed that nasa was better off operating gemini by itself blue gemini was canceled in  by secretary of defense robert mcnamara who decided that the nasa gemini flights could conduct necessary
