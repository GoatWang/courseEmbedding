review events talk log in     s garfield aveste alhambra ca    such a great experience i came in with a sharp pain in my lower neckupper back dr kuo really takes the time to explain to you why youre feeling pain and what treatments hes going to do week after week he explains to you whether or now he feels that your muscles are less scarred and you experience the pain is going away which is amazing i love that you can ask dr kuo any question about your condition and he never makes you feel like your question is dumb so glad i stumbled across dr kuo in my search for a chiropractor dr kuo gets down to business and literally attacks your issues right away i initially came in to get treated for my left ankle so that i could prance around europe and africa for  days it was a stubborn injury id lived with for yrs that i didnt dedicate time to getting treated properly i knew it would be an unpleasant trip spent hobbling around if i didnt get it fixed up beforehand well guess what this girl walked all around europe and africa with no issues i was even able to log mi in one day according to fitbit yes even after factoring in the time difference i also received treatment for the following persistent issues  numbness in the left arm and th and th fingers i feel stuff  left knee pain i was able to run a k with knee taped  lower back pain comes and goes  neck pain comes and goes dr kuo was recommended to me by my brother and i would recommend him to others everyone in the office is super nice friendly accommodating and personable ive been to a few different chiropractors and most will just adjust you and do some stretches then you are done dr kuo takes the time to explain everything he does which i really like when i first saw him he asked for xrays to really see what was going on in my neck when we looked at the xrays together he explained everything the added plus is he is very close to where i teach i came across dr kuo via yelp after being badly rearended and the service i have received has been nothing short of excellent his staff is warm welcoming and accommodating dr kuo is genuinely invested in his clients and his availability is awesome he is very effective efficient and courteous i would recommend dr kuo to my family and friends without a second thought everything about dr kuos treatment is nothing short of amazing he is the only medical professional i have ever encountered who doesnt make me feel as though he is rushing through my appointment to get to his next patient his care is extremely personalized he takes the time to address all issues and thoroughly answers any questions or concerns i may have at the end of each visit i have been seeing him for a little over a month now for what initially was excruciating neck and back pain and i can honestly say that his treatment has really helped his facilities are also very clean and wellkept would highly recommend called in to do a quick treatment the guy answered the phone say sure and they can take walkin no problem and then i said i just need a quick one time adjustment and nothing else then he quickly got impatient cut me off and said you need appointment and hung up on me wish theres more i can add to this but that was exactly what happened whole conversation was roughly  seconds long he literally said they can take walkin no problem then turned  and said i need appointment and hung me up a customer service awesome service they really care about you and your pains the secretary and the doctor were super friendly and welcoming they welcome you with a big smile plus if you arrive early to your appointment they will take you if time permits of course all in all i would highly recommend ps dr kuo helped me find directions to a place i wanted to go when i left my phone at home dr david kuo cares he takes an excellent care of my lower back pain issues as well as my wifes sciatica and tfl problems dr kuo is very professional he always treats us with great patience and  efforts we strongly recommend dr kuos chiropractic treatments overall great experience i probably would have spent a ton of  had i decided to go through my doctor rather than coming here i am not the best at explaining things but dr kuo knew exactly what it was and diagnosed me with piriformis syndrome within minutes he went into a detailed explanation of what it was and why i was experiencing the pain i was experiencing the sessions were painful but they helped me tremendously he showed me how to stretch the muscle and has sent videos explaining piriformis syndrome thank you doctor david is best doctor i ever seen before when i got lower back problem last year i was really anxious and afraid of having treatment however my sister introduced davids clinic and david was patient to explain my back problem he was so professional and you would know every detail about your problem he also helped and encouraged me to do physical therapy step by step before doing physical therapy i felt relaxing because david would try to talk and make conversation with you right now my lower back problem is better now after one year treatment i am really thank you for davids efforts if you have similar problems like me just go to davids clinic he will help you solve it my body feels great after the adjustment amazing service and friendly recommend going here i was referred to dr kuo by a coworker after my car was rearended and i was experiencing pain in my neck and shoulders dr kuo was able to diagnose the exact source of my pain and with a few months of treatment i feel much better in addition to that dr kuo diagnosed other issues not related to the accident ie ddd and  herniated discs in my lower back that were causing major discomfort and headaches for which i am now getting treatment and notice marked improvement aside from the great technical expertise dr kuo is extremely personable genuine caring and straightforward it also helps that he has great taste in office music the receptionist angela is also super kind and helpful both angela and dr kuo have been extremely accommodating and understanding with my sometimes last minute changes to appointments due to work or parenting responsibilities i highly recommend dr kuo for your chiropractic needs dr kuo and his friendly staff provide professional and quality service scheduling and wait room time is very efficient the physical office environment is modern and simple dr kuos knowledge medical skills and bedside manners allow for progressive healing sessions after trying more than  chiropractors in the last few years i have finally found an accessible doctor i trust and recommend thank you dr kuo dr kuos office is very friendly and professional they understand and have big sympathy of patiences suffering and provide the right treatment according to the issue dr kuo is very knowledgeable patient and helpful i have neck pain and shoulder pain and the symptoms have been relieved a lot since i had treatment from dr kuo i highly recommend seeing him if you need a chiropractor dr kuo may have an intimidating face but hes actually friendly and caring he likes to ask about your life and whats new so its never one of those awkward silent doctor visits he has very good interpersonal skills i see dr kuo to prevent my scoliosis from worsening he made me more anxious about my condition in the foreseeable future but at least i know im doing something about it while im still young aside from adjusting my spine he has also instructed me to do some exercises at home to strengthen my back muscles ive also had hand treated after a major car accident i wasnt able to put force on my hand for weeks so i asked him to look at it he ended up cracking it back into place and it was fine again the process of pushing your muscles back into place may be extremely painful but well worth it he also tends to my aging father and gives him tips beyond the scope of chiropractics to enhance his lifestyle also shout out to the receptionist winnie shes very nice and puts on interesting showsmovies to watch on the big screen tv so you wont get bored in the waiting room i also like how i get text notifications the day before my appointment so i never forget i did some research before i goes to dr kuo he is very patient and very knowledgeable treats my pain completely not just treating it locally but finding out the causes and treats it completely the clinic is very clean and comfortable dr kuo is a very friendly guy highly recommended dr kuo is a nice doctor with awesome skill he is very patient and careful i suffer from my low back issue for long time ago after i met dr kuo my back is getting better and better no doubt with his skill i have periformis syndrome and have gone to different chiropractors only to get adjusted and not target the problem dr kuo took time and worked with me focusing on my problem it was not a  minute office visit his treatment gave me relief and i feel so much better i highly recommend dr kuo he is awesome hands down david is one of the best doctors ive had the pleasure of knowing i first went to see him in early  because of lower back pain he noticed i had a serious but treatable problem i was very anxious and concerned but david was willing to take the time to explain why i had the condition as well as layout a course of treatment that fit my lifestyle and schedule so all of my fears and anxieties were quickly relieved after several weeks of treatment we became friends i really appreciated his willingness to spend extra time and personal attention even with health issues outside the scope of my treatment how many doctors will contact you by facebook or text to make sure youre doing okay or send you information that may be helpful it was because of davids attentiveness to my health that he was able to diagnose a unrelated problem which had been ailing me for a long time and for this i will be forever grateful because i am able resume a lifestyle which i previously was no longer able to lead if youre looking for a doctor with experience and knows what hes talking about can get the job done and most importantly cares about his patients david kuo is the one you should see i highly highly highly highly recommend him to anyone i know i highly recommend seeing david for chiropractic services in the san gabriel valley area hes very friendly and easy to communicate with he is very knowledgeable and caring he educates you on all sorts of exercises and facts about the issue on hand hes truthful about whether or not a jointbone problem can be fixed great doctor with great interpersonal skills if i ever have any more jointbone issues i would drive the extra distance to see him david kuo dc claimed this business has

in     s garfield aveste alhambra ca    such a great experience i came in with a sharp pain in my lower neckupper back dr kuo really takes the time to explain to you why youre feeling pain and what treatments hes going to do week after week he explains to you whether or now he feels that your muscles are less scarred and you experience the pain is going away which is amazing i love that you can ask dr kuo any question about your condition and he never makes you feel like your question is dumb so glad i stumbled across dr kuo in my search for a chiropractor dr kuo gets down to business and literally attacks your issues right away i initially came in to get treated for my left ankle so that i could prance around europe and africa for  days it was a stubborn injury id lived with for yrs that i didnt dedicate time to getting treated properly i knew it would be an unpleasant trip spent hobbling around if i didnt get it fixed up beforehand well guess what this girl walked all around europe and africa with no issues i was even able to log mi in one day according to fitbit yes even after factoring in the time difference i also received treatment for the following persistent issues  numbness in the left arm and th and th fingers i feel stuff  left knee pain i was able to run a k with knee taped  lower back pain comes and goes  neck pain comes and goes dr kuo was recommended to me by my brother and i would recommend him to others everyone in the office is super nice friendly accommodating and personable ive been to a few different chiropractors and most will just adjust you and do some stretches then you are done dr kuo takes the time to explain everything he does which i really like when i first saw him he asked for xrays to really see what was going on in my neck when we looked at the xrays together he explained everything the added plus is he is very close to where i teach i came across dr kuo via yelp after being badly rearended and the service i have received has been nothing short of excellent his staff is warm welcoming and accommodating dr kuo is genuinely invested in his clients and his availability is awesome he is very effective efficient and courteous i would recommend dr kuo to my family and friends without a second thought everything about dr kuos treatment is nothing short of amazing he is the only medical professional i have ever encountered who doesnt make me feel as though he is rushing through my appointment to get to his next patient his care is extremely personalized he takes the time to address all issues and thoroughly answers any questions or concerns i may have at the end of each visit i have been seeing him for a little over a month now for what initially was excruciating neck and back pain and i can honestly say that his treatment has really helped his facilities are also very clean and wellkept would highly recommend called in to do a quick treatment the guy answered the phone say sure and they can take walkin no problem and then i said i just need a quick one time adjustment and nothing else then he quickly got impatient cut me off and said you need appointment and hung up on me wish theres more i can add to this but that was exactly what happened whole conversation was roughly  seconds long he literally said they can take walkin no problem then turned  and said i need appointment and hung me up a customer service awesome service they really care about you and your pains the secretary and the doctor were super friendly and welcoming they welcome you with a big smile plus if you arrive early to your appointment they will take you if time permits of course all in all i would highly recommend ps dr kuo helped me find directions to a place i wanted to go when i left my phone at home dr david kuo cares he takes an excellent care of my lower back pain issues as well as my wifes sciatica and tfl problems dr kuo is very professional he always treats us with great patience and  efforts we strongly recommend dr kuos chiropractic treatments overall great experience i probably would have spent a ton of  had i decided to go through my doctor rather than coming here i am not the best at

was experiencing the sessions were painful but they helped me tremendously he showed me how to stretch the muscle and has sent videos explaining piriformis syndrome thank you doctor david is best

future but at least i know im doing something about it while im still young aside from adjusting my spine he has also instructed me to do some exercises at home to strengthen my back muscles ive also had hand treated after a major car accident i wasnt able to put force on my hand for weeks so i asked him to look at it he ended up cracking it back into place and it was fine again the process of
