search search heres why the best is yet to come for coeur mining inc coeur mining is transforming which means its also the best time for you to consider the stock neha chamaria nehams jun   at pm its become a new normal for coeur mining nysecde shares to take a hit after earnings releases the stock tanked after the silver and gold producer released its fourthquarter and fiscal  numbers in early february and then they fell a bit more after the firstquarter release in april year to date coeur is down  as of this writing but why is the market punishing a company that ended  with record production is striving to cut costs and appears to be on its way to another record year coeur is in a transformational phase and theres perhaps no better time to consider a stock than when a company is turning around here are just some of the things that coeur is doing right and that could propel its shares higher in the near future tapping additional sources of income after ending fiscal  with a production record of  million silver equivalent ounces seo coeur now expects its seo to rise to roughly  million ounces at the midpoint this year nearly half of that production growth is expected to come from coeurs largest multiplemine complex palmarejo in mexico which is in the midst of a major expansion phase palmarejo should bring in money for coeur in two ways  higher production and the income from its renewed gold streaming agreement with franconevada corp nysefnv image source getty images franconevada is a preciousmetals streaming and royalty company that buys metal streams from pure miners like coeur at low costs in exchange for funding the miners upfront last year coeur and franconevada renewed their agreement under which franconevada buys  of the gold produced from palmarejo at  an ounce thats almost twice the amount franconevada was paying coeur under its old agreement coeur made its first gold sale to franconevada under the new agreement in q  in fact coeurs q cash flows took a hit because of higher inventory as it retained gold to sell later to the streaming company  a fact that investors chose to overlook while banking on such streaming and royalty agreements for a steady flow of income coeur is focused on increasing its reserves in line with those goals coeur has outlined an exploration budget of  million this year compared with the  million it spent in fiscal  aside from palmarejo two other key mines coeur is ramping up are rochester in nevada and kensington in alaska of course coeur isnt the only miner expanding its business  hecla mining nysehl is among its peers growing at a strong pace hitting record production levels and reducing costs but coeur stands out for two reasons the way its redefining its portfolio in terms of metal and geographic mix and moves that ensure longterm benefits strengthening its product and geographic mix you probably know coeur as a silver producer but youd be surprised to know that the company has changed its product mix so dramatically in recent years that  of its revenue came from gold last year versus only  in  that was all part of a wellplanned strategy that involved a shift toward the yellow metal and the lucrative streaming agreement from franconevada image source coeur mining at the same time coeur operates in one of the safest geographic regions with  of revenue originating in the us last year versus only  in  again this improved geographic mix positions coeur better than its rivals tahoe resources nysetaho for example operates primarily out of the higherrisk nation of guatemala improving mining technique to cut costs theres another area where coeur has made significant progress in recent quarters the transition from openpit mining to  underground mining which translates into higher metal recovery rates and production at lower costs coeur is focused on two key growth areas production and costs while ive already elaborated on what its doing on the production front coeur also cut down its allinsustaining costs by  year over year to  per ounce of silver in q coeurs fullyear costs could be slightly higher because of lower production from its wharf mine in south dakota but its costs should trend down as its ongoing expansion projects start adding to its top line foolish takeaway solid growth potential ahead coeur ceo mitchell j krebs perfectly summed up  during the companys q earnings call when he referred to the year as a key inflection point for coeur palmarejo could be a gamechanger as it has the potential to push coeurs production and cash flows substantially higher in the near future given its growth catalysts and the fact that coeur is already generating strong operating and free cash flow a current pricetocash flow of  looks like a bargain

parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in

tankwoodworkshop search compare listings homefrequently asked questions frequently asked questions general questions why does gold rush expeditions sell mining claims instead of working them themselves our mission is to preserve mining history and to reestablish the glory days of mining that has been our goal from the very beginning thousands of mine sites are destroyed across the west each year by the blm forest service and other land managers every mine we claim and sell can be moved off of that list of “abandoned mines” and thus preserved we seek to document and preserve the work that made the west what it is today if gold rush stopped to “work” these mines we would not be able to document and procure new sites we would become strictly a mining company that’s not who we are and not what we do we sell mines with visible veins of gold or gems every day the mission of gold rush expeditions inc is not to mine these sites to coin a phrase “we find ’em you mine ’em”    can i look at a claim site and test some samples before i buy absolutely but we do require a signed nondisclosureconfidentiality agreement prior to disclosing the location of sites we do this because we spend a lot of time locating these sites and believe they have value and often times the new claimant does not want a lot of people wandering around their claim after purchase in the case of claims listed on our website we can hold a claim for seven days with a nonrefundable deposit of  if you decide to purchase the claim the  can then be used towards your purchase we can also provide you with authorization to remove up to  lbs of sample how does gold rush expeditions inc determine the price for each claim there are a variety of elements that determine the pricing of a particular mining claim or block of mining claims for your information here are some of the elements that are taken into consideration mineral content the surveyors themselves look through any available tailings to find evidence of precious metals they inspect the ores and veins personally and report the visible presences of any valuable minerals it doesn’t get any more direct than that the surveyors are looking for minerals that can be taken by hand in many cases they bypass many mines with “microscopic gold” or “sulphide minerals” because they are difficult to extract value from that is the reason you see gold rush mines stating “free milling gold” or visible gems and deposits while our historical research is extensive and painstaking we don’t solely rely on that second hand information we validate and verify right on site scarcityrarity contrary to popular belief there are many mines out there with substantial mineral reserves and values with that in mind mines are being destroyed by the blm and forest service on a daily basis  years ago you could find a good producing mine in any variety of districts across the west not today with reclamation becoming a business for the government closures are more prevalent usable mining claims are becoming more scarce for instance in a county or a district with high gold values but very few viable mines those mines will have increased value our goal is to find a mine that is still intact preferably not reclaimed that can be worked profitably under casual use with no government interference there are a lot of factors to take into consideration we judge them all and pass the information to you location location in a key mining district or region is vital to pricing of a claim if the mine is located in a gulch or drainage it may rank higher gold rush expeditions inc surveyors will often overlook mines that are right off the highway no one wants to deal with lots of passerby’s unless the mine is completely stunning and secure  gold rush expeditions inc’s ideal sites are large remote and undisturbed with substantial documentation even though a more remote mine will rank high it’s not much good to you if you cannot build a road to it another element of the critique is if the claim is easily accessible by road or trail a mine that is inaccessible cannot ship out ores and its thus going to rank low on our scale environment the next element that is addressed are factors in the climate and environment in general we look at the available resources on the site and make note if there’s any shelter water or timber having year round water is often pivotal and shelter is more than necessary when the sun is beating down on you some older mines will have remnants of old structures and that can prove useful to a miner whether it’s providing shelter in a cabin or utilizing an old mill sometimes it is easier and cheaper to utilize existing structures than building new also as part of environment we consider the aesthetics is the mine itself awe inspiring does it have a special and unique look to it that you can’t quite find anywhere else does it have character does it have an interesting story  market all of the elements above put together a good picture of the market for specific mines and properties this market will fluctuate slightly from year to year but similar to real estate it always seems to grow as mining companies and small miners pay more for claims the values of others will grow naturally history can attest to how valuable a mine is records of the mine producing gold andor other precious metals the general trend is a positive one where the exact mine claim that sold in  for k today will sell for over k in most regions that’s not a bad trend does gold rush expeditions inc offer leases andor shared ventures gold rush expeditions inc does not often enter into shared ventures but there are rare occasions where we have been able to assist small miners in getting their operations up and running for a share of the smelter returns  gold rush expeditions inc does offer leases on many of its higher priced mining claim blocks this is to assist the smaller miner with start up costs we require an initial deposit and monthly lease payments this is also predicated upon  return of net smelter returns can i sell my mining claim through gold rush expeditions inc yes gold rush expeditions

unpatented lode claim gives the claimant complete ownership of all minerals and gems located within the confines of the mining claim  lode mineral claims give ownership of minerals that are located in their original location or amalgamated in a host rock placer mineral claims give ownership of valuable minerals or gems that have been displaced from their original lodes and can be found in gravels or riverbeds placer claims usually apply to the topmost  inches of gravel or sands all unpatented mineral claim rights are subject to annual renewal plainly put if you do not renew your claim annually those rights will revert back to the us federal government keep your mining claim active and valid by paying your annual assessments before september st of each year ownership of a mining claim either placer or lode does not by default convey or imply ownership or interest in any buildings machinery or other equipment that is found within the boundaries of the claim in the case of many mining claims it is possible to take control of the buildings machinery or other items by filing a notice of operation and utilizing the  items in conjunction with or to promote your mineral extraction operation  use of any implement building or machine on the mineral claim may not violate the antiquities act of  any items that have been undisturbed undisturbed means that the item has not been moved or utilized in any manner for over  years are subject to the antiquities act and any movement or removal of said items is a violation of federal law when in doubt please inquire gold rush expeditions

inc can assist with the annual assessment process to ensure that you retain ownership of your claim each year can an unpatented claim be changed to a patented claim no not at this time there is currently a moratorium on patenting mining claims this was signed in by president bill clinton in  specifically to hinder mining efforts in the united states until this moratorium is lifted  it is not currently possible to patent gain full ownership of the land an unpatented mining claim how many claims can an individual own there is no limit to the number of claims you can own in order to file a small miner waiver for annual assessments you cannot own over  claims how long does a mining claim remain active indefinitely provided that the annual assessment payments are kept current these annual assessments must be completed by september st of each year werent most mines abandoned because they were all mined out it may come as a surprise but most mines were not abandoned due to lack of production or minerals there are many reasons that mines were abandoned the most common are related to regulation and are as follows the “silver crash” of  federal support for purchase of silver and silver ores was removed in  the value of silver dropped from over  per ounce to  per ounce in  stabilizing at an average of  by the end of the year this equated to a cut of more than  consider the impact that losing  of your income tomorrow would have on your own economy as a result many silver mines were mothballed while waiting for the price to rise to previous levels of  per ounce during wwi and wwii many left their mines to either fight in the war or help support the war effort by working in other industries in  president roosevelt made it illegal to pursue the mining of any minerals except those considered strategic this act was known as the war act and its intent was to cripple the mining industry while providing man power for wwii  men never returned from wwii this left their mining operations abandoned in addition over  were wounded left permanently disabled and were unable to return to their mines  many men after wwii never returned to their mines in the years after wwii the federal government bolstered efforts to encourage people to work in the cities and offices of the nation  since the repeal of the war act in  mining activity decreased over  these mines were left abandoned because people died or were no longer able to work their mines many more people held their mining claims while they worked their city jobs from  all the while promising to return to mining at some point most never did and when they died or stopped paying on their claims they were considered abandoned where can i get raw ore processed gold rush expeditions inc recommends the paradine

that can be used to purchase barter or trade for most any item how does gold differ from pyrite pyrite is a derivative of iron pyrite often occurs in gold lodes old spanish prospectors lived by the motto “gold rides an iron horse” meaning that where you find heavy concentrations of iron you will find gold if you find something that you think is gold use the knife method to verify gold is mallable it will feel soft you can gouge it with a knife but it will not scratch pyrite on the other hand is a more crystalline formation and is very hard if you scratch it with a knife the surface will mar and become defaced gold and pyrite differ slightly in color shape hardness odor and malleability it’s not difficult to tell the two apart once you have seen them side by side gold also forms in and with pyrite in a form known as auferous pyrite for more information please seedifference between gold and pyrite what does gold look like in its native formin the host rock the appearance of gold is dependent on how it is formed native gold in a good mine will look exactly like what it is gold gold is soft it can be “dented” with the tip of a knife or other hard object gold is also globulus meaning it is not crystalline it will not have hard edges or any crystal formations native gold is also called “free gold” or “free milling gold” this  refers to gold that can be crushed and panned out by crushing the rock you will break the gold out of it it can then be panned out with water or other chemicals  gold can also be microscopic and invisible to the naked eye unless you are planning a pit mine processing thousands of tons per day microscopic gold is as good as no gold gold often runs with quartz gold also alloys with metals such as copper iron and silver an old miner adage is that that you always want to be on the look out for one of the  metals which always occur together those being gold silver copper and platinum the concentrations may vary but this is a very accurate statement this is why there are a lot of mines named “the  metals” where can i find the current price on goldsilver gold rush expeditions inc recommends kitcocom kitco website properties

us about us the story of gold rush expeditions – from then ’til now it all started with george thompson and a book called “some dreams die” in  the book is basically a treasure hunter’s handbook george set up grand images of mining days gone by and the lost treasures buried by miners indians and other outlaws in  driver’s license in one hand and a well read dogeared copy of “some dreams die” corey set out to find these lost treasures endless days and long starry nights were spent wandering and exploring the hills of utah’s remote and unforgiving west desert days were spent matching lore with real maps and history and then finding and documenting the old areas one aspect became clear and consistent with each discovery everything was tied to mining sites that lead to a different search what was this mining thing and why was it nearly dead for the average person today history is pretty clear that the west was settled on one concept mining anyone could be a prospector these prospectors combed the hills and sometimes made a strike farmers and ranchers followed feeding the miners this was the start of a community soon a small town would form because americans are capitalists if anything and these miners and ranchers needed supplies as the mines expanded so did the towns soon there were rail lines be aware that the cross country rail lines were not built for the people and tourism of the nation no they were built to transport massive loads of gold and silver ores to mills and plants these towns would flourish from mining schools hospitals and more would pop up in support of the mining operations in many cases when the mines died out for whatever reasons the towns would fade as well it’s a story that can be seen all over the west even today corey found it intriguing that most every town in utah could be traced back to mining even brigham young and his band of mormons were only able to survive by selling wares to the people who passed along on their way to the gold fields of nevada or the gold rush lands of california yet very little mining was happening today  over the years corey couldn’t help but notice more and more historic mining sites vanishing from the landscape tunnels and drifts that made up the being of many men’s lives were backfilled and bulldozed the history completely destroyed and the mines and their locations becoming lost knowledge a bit of investigation showed that this history was being viciously destroyed by our own us forest service and bureau of land management through their abandoned mine reclamation programs no concern for history or the heritage of a mine camp that had been tucked away for  years in a long forgotten canyon no concern for the men still mining their claims on the weekend for some extra money the mission of these agencies is nothing less than the eradication of mining from the face of the land entire historic mine camps from the s through the great depression arewere being burned and bulldozed at an alarming rate this destruction included mills ore bins trusses and cabins these historic mines where people had built a life were being completely erased from the landscape never to be seen again utah division of oil gas and mining director john baza said it best “it’s time to erase the scar of mining from this land” one week these abandoned mining camps would be there the next week there would be an empty bulldozed piece of land no history no remembrance of the men and women who worked slept and may have died there the concept of wiping out the history of these people and what they built through mining was completely unacceptable corey was determined to do something about it and so gold rush expeditions was born today gold rush expeditions inc combs the historic maps and documents locating valuable and historic mining sites that are still standing as a company we have come to learn that mining is not dead many mines hold millions and sometimes billions of dollars in gold and gem reserves gold rush expeditions inc locates these sites and documents them thoroughly then offering them up for sale providing opportunities for mining to grow and live again mining has been around since the beginning of time and it’s not too difficult to make a living like thousands of miners have done over the years “we find ’em you mine ’em” that pretty much sums it up over the years gold rush expeditions have become experts at finding the best available mines in the west and then documenting and presenting those mines to the public gre takes care of all of the paperwork with the blm and simplifies the process then we show you what you need to do to mine it our legal team helps you through all of the steps of permitting and turning your mining operation into a working producing mine  gold rush expeditions inc also sponsors the national bureau of mines a repository of every mine and mine site that they have documented over the years the goal is to educate people about america’s mining heritage remind us all that we come from tough stock people who were both dreamers and doers highlighting the incredible feats they accomplished gold rush expeditions inc wants to bring back the gold rush gold rush expeditions inc wants these mining sites to be around for future generations to learn from and enjoy gold rush expeditions inc formally formed as an incorporated entity in  since that time they have grown exponentially evolving into a powerful force restoring mining as a way of life mining today today the opportunity for mining is greater than it has ever been old mines that were abandoned when gold mining was made illegal by the war act are still out there these mines provided more than a living they provided independence and freedom  gold rush expeditions inc locates mines throughout the west these mines are ready to work with rich veins visible and ores exposed while regulations have increased the tools and ability to process the ore from these historic mines are more effective than ever while each year more and more mines are erased from our landscape gold rush expeditions inc is racing against the destruction we are out documenting the old mines in the backcountry of the west researching surveying and filing claims on the valuable sites these mines were america’s past success and with a little work they are america’s future success gold rush envisions the transition a generation of paper pushing computer terminal warriors being transformed into an army of miners creating their own future and prosperity working underground digging out gold and gems  over the years gold rush has seen that we are not alone there are many miners in waiting snapping up these sites as quickly as we can locate them gold rush is playing a small part in helping americans to remember and appreciate their past this while offering an opportunity to work the mines and provide a good living for themselves “it’s a st century gold rush if our kids and their kids have something to look back on then we are accomplishing what we have set out to do”   a crash course on abandoned mine reclamation back in the ’s the nation’s mining heritage dotted if not covered the landscape of the western states an estimated  to  thousand of these old abandoned mines were found scattered throughout the west their head frames and waste piles provided a glimpse into the nation’s past today there are still some surviving mines on federal lands but most of those will be gone in a few decades the loss of western mining heritage will accelerate in the coming years rather than diminish not because of the gradual effects of wind weather and vandals but primarily due to government reclamation programs in  congress passed the surface mining control and reclamation act which taxes active coal mines the funds were meant to fix safety hazards and environmental problems from two centuries of coal mining but increasingly the funds are applied towards eliminating historic hard rock mines in the west since the passage of the act in   billion has been spent by the office of surface mining osm to reclaim old mines that have been deemed “hazardous” the history of these landmarks is gone forever never to be seen again why the blm and fs are bent on closing abandoned mines the bureau of land management and forest service claim that they are bulldozing old mining sites for public safety which is a believable story until you look at the numbers from  to  there were only  deaths across the united states attributed to abandoned mines in  there were  deaths attributed to abandoned mines in  there were  deaths attributed to abandoned mines in relation there are approximately  people per day that die while swimming in lakes and rivers across the us that is over  people per year so why isn’t there more of a focus on lake and river safety follow the money they have the money to spend and it’s use it or risk losing it there also seems to be an underlying current among the blm and forest service to reclaim much of the land in the west to its primitive state it appears that the blm and forest service use the surface mining control and reclamation act to reclaim mines and the endangered species act to close large swaths of land with the same goal to keep the public from using the land why it is important to preserve our mining heritage the destruction of these historic landmarks is alarming we are actively destroying our heritage we are standing on the shoulders of giants and at the same time our government organizations are determined to erase all evidence that these giants ever existed when we remember the struggles that our predecessors went through and the obstacles they overcame we begin to see that we are part of a larger narrative it gives us added strength we become more resilient and better able to deal with the challenges in our own lives the ingenuity resourcefulness and the stick to it mentality of these old miners are absolutely amazing here they were far from civilization making their living cutting tunnels and bringing out gold they built small towns with whatever resources they could find they crossed the plains and built every mining town from leadville colorado and virginia city nevada to butte montana they were independent and hardworking dreamers who in very essence built the west thomas paine wrote over  years ago “what we obtain too cheap we esteem too lightly” in a bigger sense when we forget the price that was paid for the rise of this nation and the struggles that we overcame to get where we are we esteem our current position too lightly and we risk losing what our ancestors worked so hard to gain one of the main reasons we work so hard to preserve these old mines is so that we have the physical reminders of the contributions of those who went before us   in corey’s own words “it’s a wild ride i never expected to see so many mining enthusiasts we’ve had our fair share of tough times but i have no regrets this is what i love doing and the more mines i can save and put into production the bigger the chance that these mines and their history will be preserved the best part is seeing the number of people who are able to make a good living working mines that would have otherwise been destroyed” properties

lode details gold rush expeditions  month ago i really like this claim it is one of the nicest you have offered i loved it the last time it was available i’d just like to add corey you and your crew are awesome you have provided a great deal of information on mining and prospecting and have been professional and upstanding to the utmost you are helping to make the dream come true for many have a great day by steven adler you can’t go wrong buying a mine from gre they are honest and accurate with their details i can’t say enough so nuf’ said by don wotherspoon last spring i bought a lode mining claim in southern arizona from gold rush expeditions gre i purchased this claim from gre because i felt that they were a reputable professional company in september i received a notice from blm that they wanted an amendment to the notice of location that had previously been accepted by the county and blm or else they would terminate my claim i contacted gre and they quickly responded to this regulatory change by blm and submitted amendments to the county and blm which have been recorded successfully it is one thing to have a company complete a sale and accept your funds it is another to have that company come through for you after the sale when it matters i highly recommend gre as a competent company with integrity i would go back to them again in the future by c h we have done business with gold rush almost since the inception we have purchased andor sold numerous claims with gold rush and have always had a very pleasant purchasing and selling experience phone calls emails and messages have always been handled in prompt courteous manner we would recommend gold rush expeditions to our valued customers and friends as having a highly respectful and honest organization you need not worry as their word tends to be their bond by bc massey vp  onyx exploration when gre says that they want satisfied customers its not just words they prove it with actions that go beyond normal business practices so this is a shout out to them kudos for all by anonymous buyer purchased on aug   i have bought other claims from individuals that were later forfeited to the blm because of a failure by the previous owners to file the proper paperwork i was able to reclaim the claims but what a pain and waste of time and money i know when i purchase a claim from gold rush expeditions the claim is solid and your support team is there if assistance is needed i would especially recommend purchasing claims from gold rush expeditions to someone who is new to prospecting i am waiting for the weather to cooperate a little more before going to the claim but i feel like i have already been there by way of your video i hope to purchase more claims from gold rush expeditions in the future by anonymous buyer purchased on feb th  gre has answered my questions and some i didnt have very nice to work with easy communication and fast service i would highly recommend them for a mine purchase
