texass capital has a reputation for being a difficult environment for startup funding so when the time comes how do companies in the city handle finding investors by tom foster tom foster is an inc editoratlarge his work has also appeared in popular science fast company details and mens journal among others a longtime new yorker he is a recent transplant to austin tomfoster editoratlarge inctomfoster  comments austin credit getty images in honor of small business week inc reporters deployed to several cities where they spent one day talking to owners and entrepreneurs in a particular sector about their challenges joah spearman meets me for coffee a few blocks from his home in east austin which is also the headquarters of his company localeur spearman a former director of operations at bazaarvoice an austin enterprise software business that went public in  started localeur in early  the company publishes usergenerated restaurant and shopping recommendations geared toward travelersspearman calls it a millennial tripadvisor localeur launched at sxsw and got a lot of media attention ending up on numerous beststartup and besttravelapp lists from the likes of the today show and time spearman a rarity in austin as a black tech entrepreneur became a familiar media presence in the local startup scene localeur founder joah spearmancredit gary williams jr yet fundraising for localeur has been a painful grind not one of the local venture capital firms has invested and spearman has instead raised  million in mostly small increments he has  angel investors including a couple of early facebook leaders and several former bazaarvoice executives hes given away some  percent of the companys equity in the process we got through the first three years averaging two months worth of runway spearman says so i was raising money pretty much every month here  there and the occasional  the team grew to six people but by late  spearman had laid two of them off and moved the company into his house he sold his car and replaced it with a scooter talk of the tech industry conjures images of worldeaters like facebook and amazon or scrappy somethings in hoodies who raise scads of venture capital in pursuit of the next unicorn in fact only a small fraction of startupseven tech startups those most dynamic of small businessesattract professional money a preponderance of them in northern california in the rest of the country vc money is scarcer and more scattered consequently a large majority of tech entrepreneurs lead lives very different from the denizens of hbos silicon valley who ride a roller coaster of feast and famine the funding gap is obvious in austin which has at times been called somewhat cynically the land of the bootstrapped tech company two years ago david altounian a professor of entrepreneurship at st edwards university a small liberalarts school close to downtown took a hard look at the investment environment here altounian who is also a former dell executive and tech entrepreneur explains that five years ago the number of tech startups in austin started to explode the industry was always prominent here first centered around large ibm and motorola outposts and then dell and then a few big software companies in the late s by the late aughts when sxsw became the worlds biggest geek party the crunchy college town had become a shiny new startup hub but the money invested in the citys startups never seemed to measure up to the hype you had a lot more people fighting for the same pool of capital altounian says localeur aims to help travelers discover the best local places to eat drink and morecredit gary williams jr what altounian found stunned the citys tech industry while according to the kauffman foundation austin has the nations highest level of startup activity essentially the rate of new company creation it ranks th for vc funding in  the citys startups raised  million in venture capital while their peers in the boston area raised  billion and the bay area almost  billion whats more while the average deal in most metro areas is around  million its  million in austin with the appearance of altounians research the longsimmering discontent with austins funding scene boiled over questions and blame drove twitter fights medium manifestos and live debates austin investors play it too safe some said austin entrepreneurs dont chase big enough ideas said others texans just dont invest in tech coastal vcs dont bother with the flyover states and on and on some things most everyone agrees on austin investors prefer businesstobusiness companies over the sexy consumer plays associated with san francisco bringing in actual revenue early is important good luck if you plan to grow users first develop a business model later and getting funding for a highly speculative moon shot company is itself something of a moon shot that all worked fine for years as the startup scene grew up around the chipmakers and other earlier infrastructure altounian says but suddenly we had this influx of new entrepreneurs who were thinking about startups more broadly while the specifics of austins funding gap are unique to this city the underlying reality is not last year nearly  percent of venture capital in the us went to entrepreneurs in just three states california new york and massachusetts forty percent went to the bay area alone to understand the lessglamorous norm of small tech businesses nationwide austin is a good place to start the long slog joah spearman of localeur says the main reason he has struggled to raise funding is that austins venture capital community lacks an appetite for consumer internet companies there are two ways we could approach this spearman says we can focus on user growth first which would be the silicon valley way or we can focus on revenue first which is what the austin guys want we spent two years going back and forth hearing the opposite from investors and potential investors where spearman erred was not committing to either approach by mid the companys persistent limbo state had evolved into a financial and existential crisis spearman published a heartfelt medium post simultaneously declaring his love for austin the main image was his wrist tattoo of the citys crest and announcing that he would likely move localeur to california soon after localeurs business got a shot of adrenaline the company signed a contentsyndication deal with jetblue and the pace of geographic expansion increased localeur now serves  cities in the us and canada in october spearman raised another  million from some of his existing investors and started fielding calls from online travel companies interested in buying localeur spearman acknowledges that getting acquired soon would probably be the best outcome although he expects the price would likely be low if we were to take it to silicon valley now wed look like were limping in after getting beat up in austin he says that was not a good look as he shopped for a series a of course it is entirely possible that localeur simply wasnt the right idea but spearman feels hes never had the chance to make it work his experience speaks to what kinds of companies do and dont make it in secondary tech markets it also speaks to a point made by altounian that even when earlystage money in a city is adequate startups splutter without funds to reach escape velocity going it alone square root employeescredit courtesy square root square root is the model of a bootstrapped tech company the business which helps big chains manage multiple retail locations launched  years ago and has never raised outside money it employs  peoplemost of them working out of five repurposed craftsman bungalows at the western edge of downtownand expects to bring in about  million this year square root has landed on the inc  twice highest rank  in  as well as on fortunes best places to work growth has been fueled entirely by cash flow as founder chris taylor sees it he had no choice but to selffund his companybecause he could i knew the area i wanted to address but didnt know right away what the product would be he says so rather than raise a ton of money i was able to leverage some relationships and get some cash flow going early while we figured out the big idea once we had cash flow it just made sense to keep going on our own steam every couple of years square root faces an inflection point at which taylor considers raising money to get to the next level every time the answer ends up being no the benefits of bootstrapping come down to what taylor calls optionality vc investors he fears might prioritize their return on investment over whats good for the company and consequently limit his options you end up going down these  percent success paths instead of a  percent success path because the possible value of the  percent path is higher he says also higher taylor points out is the chance that that path could kill the company its not that taylor is simply building a smaller more conservative business than most vcbacked companies were creating an entirely new categorystore relationship managementand we have customers spending millions of dollars with us he says but bootstrapping allows us to build a culture we want and a product and team we want now square root is facing its biggestever inflection point one that will test the limits of bootstrapping the company traditionally targeted the auto industry but taylor is expanding into retail that raises the prospect of more huge customers which means more doors for sales reps to knock on and more client needs to be met both will require an outsize investment for the first time im thinking i could actually spend money faster than i could make it taylor says its probably time to polish up a pitch deck for investors in other words and face the funding gap its all relative not everyone finds the austin scene inhospitable autumn manning cofounder and ceo of youearnedit says growing her company here has been better than i ever imagined manning moved to austin in  after incubating her startup out of a digital ad agency headquartered in arkansas where she had lived since she was  shes raised about  million for youearnedit including  million in january from a local vc firm called silverton partners as well as san franciscos idg ventures autumn manning of youearneditcredit courtesy tim ryan i know there are a lot of people saying you cant get a good deal in austin or that theyre getting penalized for being in austin says manning if youre saying that i would really turn the mirror on yourself and ask why you think youre getting penalized what is it that youre not doing or could do different manning acknowledges that secondary tech markets are a tougher fundraising challenge but she believes its manageable you have to be more thoughtful and your proof better be there she says but you can get a good deal here youearnedit makes software for hr departments to offer flexible rewards and recognition programs customers include whole foods dell sony and condé nast its first customers were two austinbased companies manning met with at sxsw even before youearnedit raised its seed round by the time she raised her series a this year the company had more than  customersmaking it a much easier sell than spearmans we had a business model that could survive with or without funding and theres no doubt that made a difference she says manning is a firsttime founder so pitching vcs was new to her from that experience she gained two insights first she noticed that local investors like to argue that theres plenty of funding in austin but once you get in a room oneonone with them they say look if you could get more than were offering you would get more she says so theyre actively acknowledging that theyre lowballing you because youre staying local manning called their bluff and shopped for deals around the country she got offers from firms on both coasts theyre challenging you to bring competition to the table she says so you better have the confidence to get on an airplane and go do that manning also realized that while she wanted the local support shed get from austin investors those firms likely wouldnt have enough money to lead a laterstage round if youearnedit needed that for growth so it was important to find an investor with solid connections in other markets when silverton introduced her to idg and offered to partner with the california company the deal closed published on may   localeur  product hunt product huntthe best new products every dayask●log insign up featured  years agolocaleurlocalsonly recommendations on

more important that i keep localeur alive and thriving than to increase my salary” said spearman  “i paid myself  in  and   in  and  and now am paying myself ” even with that selfgiven raise however spearman the boss hasn’t paid spearman the employee for three consecutive pay periods through midjune he said because “we are in the final few months of pushing to become cashflow positive” profitable in other words “i’m repaying the people who have believed in me throughout my entire professional journey” spearman said of the companys  investors several of whom he worked for in previous jobs they include austinbased wp engine inc ceo heather brunner jeff eller founder of the jeff eller group llc in austin and former deputy assistant and director of media affairs for president bill clinton and

localeur cover its payroll frugal habits acquired over a lifetime combined with savings he accumulated during stints at a few highpaying gigs prior to forming localeur is another way spearman is able to survive on such a low income in austin “i grew up poor” he said of his first  years spent in killeen texas and greenville south carolina “i had a single mom who raised three boys on food stamps and by working two jobs to earn some money spearman began working at age  mowing lawns when he was  he created a second revenue stream by selling bubble gum to classmates so it has gone to the present day he never stopped thinking of new ways to make sure he had money coming in spearman is the first person in his immediate family to graduate from college he knew he wasn’t attending unless he paid for it himself so spearman applied for more than  scholarships got about  of them worth roughly  and graduated from the university of texas at austin in  between commencement and localeur’s liftoff spearman held several highprofile highintensity positions • he was the primary speechwriter for david paulison director of the federal emergency management agency in  and  sometimes he’d see president george w bush and secretary of homeland security michael chertoff using what he wrote to answer anderson cooper’s questions on cnn and he often attended briefings that included at least one of those three men • he was director of operations and strategic initiatives in  for bazaarvoice inc which powers consumer product reviews online spearman also cowrote a book published in  “real role models” which profiled “ highlevel black professionals” for the purpose of introducing africanamerican youth to role models outside the sports and entertainment sectors and he founded sneak attack llc a sneaker and urbanfashion company in  and style x the official style segment of south by southwest “i felt my creativity wasn’t activated until i became an entrepreneur” spearman said of his decision to leave corporate america and begin his own ventures “my plan was to found one business every year until one stuck” how do you relieve stress i actually like stress and high pressure but for fun i run longdistance races like halfmarathons go bowling and play a lot of pingpong i have a pingpong table in my front yard if you could be any superhero who would you be wolverine of the xmen he has a
