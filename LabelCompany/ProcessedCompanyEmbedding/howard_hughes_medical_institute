democratic national committee chair larry obrien meier in collaboration with former vice president hubert humphrey and others wanted to feed misinformation to the nixon campaign meier told donald that he was sure the democrats would win the election because larry obrien had a great deal of information on richard nixons illicit dealings with howard hughes that had never been released obrien did not actually have any such information but meier wanted nixon to think he did donald told his brother that obrien was in possession of damaging hughes information that could destroy his campaign terry

moved into a bungalow at the beverly hills hotel where he also rented rooms for his aides his wife and numerous girlfriends he would sit naked in his bedroom with a pink hotel napkin placed over his

remained with rko as far as their political leanings were concerned only after ensuring that the stars under contract to rko had no suspect affiliations would hughes approve completed pictures to be sent back for reshooting this was especially true of the women who were under contract to rko at that time if hughes felt that his stars did not properly represent the political views of his liking or

financial wizard emerged unscathed during that time period rko became known as the home of film noir classic productions thanks in part to the limited budgets required to make such films during hughes

cracked ribs crushed chest with collapsed left lung shifting his heart to the right side of the chest cavity and numerous thirddegree burns an ofttold story said that hughes sent a check to the marine weekly for the remainder of his life as a sign of gratitude however durkins daughter denied that he took any money for the rescue despite his physical injuries hughes was proud that his mind was still working as he lay in his hospital bed he decided that he did not like the beds design he called in plant engineers to design a customized bed equipped with hot and cold running water built in six sections and operated by  electric motors with pushbutton adjustments the hospital bed was designed by hughes specifically to alleviate the pain caused by moving with severe burn injuries despite the fact that he never had the chance to use the bed that he designed hughes bed served as a prototype for the modern hospital bed hughes doctors considered his recovery almost miraculous hughes however believed that neither miracle nor modern medicine contributed to his recovery instead asserting the natural lifegiving properties of freshsqueezed orange juice were responsible many attribute his

those titles are currently held by the antonov an mriya the hercules flew only once for one mile  km and  feet  m above the water with hughes at the controls on november   the hercules was nicknamed the spruce goose by its critics but it was actually made largely from birch not spruce rather than of aluminum because the contract required that hughes build the aircraft of nonstrategic materials it

election richard nixon was alarmed when it was revealed that his brother donald received a  loan from hughes it has long been speculatedby whom that nixons drive to learn what the democrats were planning in  was based in part on his belief that the democrats knew about a later bribe that his friend bebe rebozo had received from hughes after nixon took office in late  donald nixon was collecting intelligence for his brother in preparation for the upcoming presidential election one of donalds sources was john h meier a former business adviser of hughes who had also worked with democratic national committee chair larry obrien meier in collaboration with former vice president hubert humphrey and others wanted to feed misinformation to the nixon campaign meier told donald that he was sure the democrats would win the election because larry obrien had a great deal of information on richard nixons illicit dealings with howard hughes that had never been released obrien did not actually have any such information but meier wanted nixon to think he did donald told his brother that obrien was in possession of damaging hughes information that could destroy his campaign terry

to him unless spoken to throughout this period hughes sat fixated in his chair often naked continually watching movies when he finally emerged in the summer of  his hygiene was terrible he had not bathed nor cut his hair and nails for weeks this may have been due to allodynia which results in a pain response to stimuli that would normally not cause pain after the screening room incident hughes moved into a bungalow at the beverly hills hotel where he also rented rooms for his aides his wife and numerous girlfriends he would sit naked in his bedroom with a pink hotel napkin placed over his genitals watching movies this may have been because hughes found the touch of clothing painful due to allodynia he may have watched movies to distract himself from his pain—a common practice among patients with intractable pain especially those who do not receive adequate treatment in one year hughes spent an estimated  million at the hotel hughes began purchasing all restaurant chains and four

the smallest amount the company could provide for a special order  gallons  l and had it shipped from los angeles a few days after the order arrived hughes announced he was tired of banana nut and wanted only french vanilla ice cream the desert inn ended up distributing free banana nut ice cream to casino customers for a year in a  interview ex–howard hughes communicator robert maheu said there

under contract to rko had no suspect affiliations would hughes approve completed pictures to be sent back for reshooting this was especially true of the women who were under contract to rko at that

end of his year involvement in the motion picture industry however his reputation as a financial wizard emerged unscathed during that time period rko became known as the home of film noir classic productions thanks in part to the limited budgets required to make such films during hughes tenure hughes reportedly walked away from rko having made  million in personal profit general tire was interested mainly in exploiting the value of the rko library for television programming even though it made some attempts to continue producing films after a year and a half of mixed success general

money for the rescue despite his physical injuries hughes was proud that his mind was still working as he lay in his hospital bed he decided that he did not like the beds design he called in plant engineers to design a customized bed equipped with hot and cold running water built in six sections and operated by  electric motors with pushbutton adjustments the hospital bed was designed by hughes specifically to alleviate the pain caused by moving with severe burn injuries despite the fact that he never had the chance to use the bed that he designed hughes bed served as a prototype for the modern hospital bed hughes doctors considered his recovery almost miraculous hughes however believed that neither miracle nor modern medicine contributed to his recovery instead asserting the natural

trustees sold hughes aircraft in  to general motors for  billion allowing the institute to grow dramatically the deal was the topic of a protracted legal battle between hughes and the internal revenue service which hughes ultimately won after his death in  many thought that the balance of hughes estate would go to the institute although it was ultimately divided among his cousins and other heirs given the lack of a will to the contrary the hhmi was the fourth largest private organization as of  and the largest devoted to biological and medical research with an endowment of  billion as of june  glomar exploreredit main article usns glomar explorer tag in  hughes was approached by the cia to help secretly recover soviet submarine k which had sunk near hawaii four years earlier the recovery

de havilland katharine hepburn ginger rogers rita hayworth and gene tierney he also proposed to joan fontaine several times according to her autobiography no bed of roses jean harlow accompanied him to the premiere of hells angels but noah dietrich wrote many years later that the relationship was strictly professional as hughes apparently personally disliked harlow in his  book howard the amazing mr hughes dietrich said that hughes genuinely liked and respected jane russell but never sought romantic involvement with her according to russells autobiography however hughes once tried to bed her after a party russell who was married at the time refused him and hughes promised it would never happen again the two maintained a professional and private friendship for many years hughes remained good friends with tierney who after his failed attempts to seduce her was quoted as saying i dont think howard could love anything that did not have a motor in it later when tierneys daughter daria was born deaf and blind and with a severe learning disability because of tierneys being exposed to rubella during her pregnancy hughes saw to it that daria received the best medical care and paid all expenses in  hughes made a purchase of an unseen luxury steam yacht named the rover which was previously owned by british shipping magnate lord inchcape i have never seen the rover but bought it on the blue prints photographs and the reports of lloyds surveyors my experience is that the english are the most honest race in the world hughes renamed the yacht southern cross and later sold her to swedish entrepreneur axel wennergren on july   hughes struck and killed a pedestrian named gabriel s meyer with his car at the corner of rd street and lorraine in los angeles after the crash hughes was taken to the hospital and certified as sober but an attending doctor made a note that hughes had been drinking a witness to the crash told police that hughes was driving erratically and too fast and that meyer had been standing in the safety zone of a streetcar stop hughes was booked on suspicion of negligent homicide and held overnight in jail until his attorney neil s mccarthy obtained a writ of habeas corpus for his release pending a coroners inquest by the time of the coroners inquiry however the witness had changed his story and claimed that meyer had moved directly in front of hughes car nancy bayly watts who was in the car with hughes at the time of the crash corroborated this version of the story on july   hughes was held blameless by a coroners jury at the inquest into meyers death hughes told reporters outside the inquiry i was driving slowly and a man stepped out of the darkness in front of me on january   hughes married actress jean peters the couple met in the s before peters became a film actress they had a highly publicized romance in  and there was talk of marriage but she said she could not combine it with her career some later claimed that peters was the only woman hughes ever loved and he reportedly had his security officers follow her everywhere even when they were not in a relationship such reports were confirmed by actor max showalter who became a close friend of peters while shooting niagara  showalter told in an interview that because he frequently met with peters hughes men threatened to ruin his career if he did not leave her alone nixon scandaledit shortly before the  presidential election richard nixon was alarmed when it was revealed that his brother donald received a  loan from hughes it has long been speculatedby whom that nixons drive to learn what the democrats were planning in  was based in part on his belief that the democrats knew about a later bribe that his friend bebe rebozo had received from hughes after nixon took office in late  donald nixon was collecting intelligence for his brother in preparation for the upcoming presidential election one of donalds sources was john h meier a former business adviser of hughes who had also worked with democratic national committee chair larry obrien meier in collaboration with former vice president hubert humphrey and others wanted to feed misinformation to the nixon campaign meier told donald that he was sure the democrats would win the election because larry obrien had a great deal of information on richard nixons illicit dealings with howard hughes that had never been released obrien did not actually have any such information but meier wanted nixon to think he did donald told his brother that obrien was in possession of damaging hughes information that could destroy his campaign terry lenzner who was the chief investigator for the senate watergate committee speculates that it was nixons desire to know what obrien knew about nixons dealings with hughes that may have partially motivated the watergate breakin physical declineedit hughes was eccentric and suffered from a severe obsessivecompulsive disorder close friends of hughes reported that he was obsessed with the size of peas one of his favorite foods and used a special fork to sort them by size while directing the outlaw hughes became fixated on a small flaw in one of jane russells blouses claiming that the fabric bunched up along a seam and gave the appearance of two nipples on each breast he wrote a detailed memorandum to the crew on how to fix the problem richard fleischer who directed his kind of woman with hughes as executive producer wrote at length in his autobiography about the difficulty of dealing with the tycoon in his book just tell me when to cry fleischer explained that hughes was fixated on trivial details and was alternately indecisive and obstinate he also revealed that hughes unpredictable mood swings made him wonder if the film would ever be completed in  hughes told his aides that he wanted to screen some movies at a film studio near his home he stayed in the studios darkened screening room for more than four months never leaving he ate only chocolate bars and chicken and drank only milk and was surrounded by dozens of kleenex boxes that he continuously stacked and rearranged he wrote detailed memos to his aides giving them explicit instructions not to look at him nor speak to him unless spoken to throughout this period hughes sat fixated in his chair often naked continually watching movies when he finally emerged in the summer of  his hygiene was terrible he had not bathed nor cut his hair and nails for weeks this may have been due to allodynia which results in a pain response to stimuli that would normally not cause pain after the screening room incident hughes moved into a bungalow at the beverly hills hotel where he also rented rooms for his aides his wife and numerous girlfriends he would sit naked in his bedroom with a pink hotel napkin placed over his genitals watching movies this may have been because hughes found the touch of clothing painful due to allodynia he may have watched movies to distract himself from his pain—a common practice among patients with intractable pain especially those who do not receive adequate treatment in one year hughes spent an estimated  million at the hotel hughes began purchasing all restaurant chains and four star hotels that had been founded within the state of texas this included if for only a short period many unknown franchises currently out of business he placed ownership of the restaurants with the howard hughes medical institute and all licenses were resold shortly after another time he became obsessed with the  film ice station zebra and had it run on a continuous loop in his home according to his aides he watched it  times hughes insisted on using tissues to pick up objects to insulate himself from germs he would also notice dust stains or other imperfections on peoples clothes and demand that they take care of them once one of the most visible men in america hughes ultimately vanished from public view although tabloids continued to follow rumors of his behavior and whereabouts he was reported to be terminally ill mentally unstable or even dead injuries from numerous aircraft crashes caused hughes to spend much of his later life in pain and he eventually became addicted to codeine which he injected intramuscularly hughes had his hair cut and nails trimmed only once a year likely due to the pain caused by the rsdcrps which was caused by the plane crashes he also stored his urine in bottles hughes had this  chrysler new yorker equipped with an aircraftgrade air filtration system that took up the entire trunk later years as a las vegas recluseedit the wealthy and aging hughes accompanied by his entourage of personal aides began moving from one hotel to another always taking up residence in the top floor penthouse in the last ten years of his life  to  hughes lived in hotels in many cities—including beverly hills boston las vegas nassau freeport vancouver london managua and acapulco on november   thanksgiving day hughes arrived in las vegas by railroad car and moved into the desert inn because he refused to leave the hotel and to avoid further conflicts with the owners hughes bought the desert inn in early  the hotels eighth floor became the nerve center of hughes empire and the ninthfloor penthouse became his personal residence between  and  he bought several other hotelcasinos including the castaways new frontier the landmark hotel and casino and the sands he bought the small silver slipper casino for the sole purpose of moving its trademark neon silver slipper visible from hughes bedroom it had apparently kept him awake at night after hughes left the desert inn hotel employees discovered that his drapes had not been opened during the time he lived there and had rotted through an unusual incident marked an earlier hughes connection to las vegas during his  engagement at the last frontier hotel flamboyant entertainer liberace mistook howard hughes for his lighting director instructing him to instantly bring up a blue light should he start to play clair de lune hughes nodded in compliance—but the hotels entertainment director arrived and introduced hughes to liberace hughes wanted to change the image of las vegas to something more glamorous as hughes wrote in a memo to an aide i like to think of las vegas in terms of a welldressed man in a dinner jacket and a beautifully jeweled and furred female getting out of an expensive car hughes bought several local television stations including klastv hughes considerable business holdings were overseen by a small panel unofficially dubbed the mormon mafia because of the many latterday saints on the committee led by frank william gay in addition to supervising daytoday business operations and hughes health they also went to great pains to satisfy hughes every whim for example hughes once became fond of baskinrobbins banana nut ice cream so his aides sought to secure a bulk shipment for him only to discover that baskinrobbins had discontinued the flavor they put in a request for the smallest amount the company could provide for a special order  gallons  l and had it shipped from los angeles a few days after the order arrived hughes announced he was tired of banana nut and wanted only french vanilla ice cream the desert inn ended up distributing free banana nut ice cream to casino customers for a year in a  interview ex–howard hughes communicator robert maheu said there is a rumor that there is still some banana nut ice cream left in the freezer it is most likely true as an owner of several major las vegas businesses hughes wielded much political and economic influence in nevada and elsewhere during the s and early s he disapproved of underground nuclear testing at the nevada test site hughes was concerned about the risk from residual nuclear radiation and attempted to halt the tests when the tests finally went through despite hughes efforts the detonations were powerful enough that the entire hotel where he was staying trembled due to the shock waves in two separate lastditch maneuvers hughes instructed his representatives to offer milliondollar bribes to both presidents lyndon b johnson and richard nixon in  jean peters filed for divorce the two had not lived together for many years peters requested a lifetime alimony payment of  a year adjusted for inflation and waived all claims to hughes estate hughes offered her a settlement of over a million dollars but she declined it hughes did not insist on a confidentiality agreement from peters as a condition of the divorce aides reported that hughes never spoke ill of her she refused to discuss her life with hughes and declined several lucrative offers from publishers and biographers peters would state only that she had not seen hughes for several years before their divorce and had only dealt with him by phone hughes was living in the intercontinental hotel near lake managua in nicaragua seeking privacy and security when a magnitude  earthquake damaged managua in december  as a precaution hughes moved to the nicaraguan national palace and stayed there as a guest of anastasio somoza debayle before leaving for florida

penthouse of the xanadu beach resort  marina for the last four years of his life hughes had spent a total of  million on his many properties in las vegas memoir hoaxedit in  author clifford irving caused a media sensation when he claimed he had cowritten an authorized autobiography of hughes hughes was so reclusive that he did not immediately publicly refute irvings statement leading many to

money for the rescue despite his physical injuries hughes was proud that his mind was still working as he lay in his hospital bed he decided that he did not like the beds design he called in plant engineers to design a customized bed equipped with hot and cold running water built in six sections and operated by  electric motors with pushbutton adjustments the hospital bed was designed by hughes specifically to alleviate the pain caused by moving with severe burn injuries despite the fact that he never had the chance to use the bed that he designed hughes bed served as a prototype for the modern hospital bed hughes doctors considered his recovery almost miraculous hughes however believed that neither miracle nor modern medicine contributed to his recovery instead asserting the natural lifegiving properties of freshsqueezed orange juice were responsible many attribute his longterm dependence on opiates to his use of codeine as a painkiller during his convalescence the trademark

close friend of peters while shooting niagara  showalter told in an interview that because he frequently met with peters hughes men threatened to ruin his career if he did not leave her alone nixon scandaledit shortly before the  presidential election richard nixon was alarmed when it was revealed that his brother donald received a  loan from hughes it has long been speculatedby whom that nixons drive to learn what the democrats were planning in  was based in part on his belief that the democrats knew about a later bribe that his friend bebe rebozo had received from hughes after nixon took office in late  donald nixon was collecting intelligence for his brother in preparation for the upcoming presidential election one of donalds sources was john h meier a former business adviser of hughes who had also worked with democratic national committee chair larry obrien meier in collaboration with former vice president hubert humphrey and others wanted to feed misinformation to the nixon campaign meier told donald that he was sure the democrats would win the election because larry obrien had a great deal of information on richard nixons illicit dealings with howard hughes that had never been released obrien did not actually have any such information but meier wanted nixon to think he did donald told his brother that obrien was in possession of damaging hughes information that could destroy his campaign terry lenzner who was the chief investigator for the senate watergate committee speculates that it was nixons desire to know what obrien knew about nixons dealings with hughes that may have partially motivated the watergate breakin physical declineedit hughes was eccentric and suffered from a severe obsessivecompulsive disorder close friends of hughes reported that he was obsessed with the size of peas one of his favorite foods and used a special fork to sort them by size while directing the outlaw hughes became fixated on a small flaw in one of jane russells blouses claiming that the fabric bunched up along a seam and gave the appearance of two nipples on each breast he wrote a detailed memorandum to the crew on how to fix the problem richard fleischer who directed his kind of woman with hughes as executive producer wrote at length in his autobiography about the difficulty of dealing with the tycoon in his book just tell me when to cry fleischer explained that hughes was fixated on trivial details and was alternately indecisive and obstinate he also revealed that hughes unpredictable mood swings made him wonder if the film would ever be completed in  hughes told his aides that he wanted to screen some movies at a film studio near his home he stayed in the studios darkened screening room for more than four months never leaving he ate only chocolate bars and chicken and drank only milk and was surrounded by dozens of kleenex boxes that he continuously stacked and rearranged he wrote detailed memos to his aides giving them explicit instructions not to look at him nor speak to him unless spoken to throughout this period hughes sat fixated in his chair often naked continually watching movies when he finally emerged in the summer of  his hygiene was terrible he had not bathed nor cut his hair and nails for weeks this may have been due to allodynia which results in a pain response to stimuli that would normally not cause pain after the screening room incident hughes moved into a bungalow at the beverly hills hotel where he also rented rooms for his aides his wife and numerous girlfriends he would sit naked in his bedroom with a pink hotel napkin placed over his genitals watching movies this may have been because hughes found the touch of clothing painful due to allodynia he may have watched movies to distract himself from his pain—a common practice among patients with intractable pain especially those who do not receive adequate treatment in one year hughes spent an estimated  million at the hotel hughes began purchasing all restaurant chains and four star hotels that had been founded within the state of texas this included if for only a short period many unknown franchises currently out of business he placed ownership of the restaurants with the howard hughes medical institute and all licenses were resold shortly after another time he became obsessed with the  film ice station zebra and had it run on a continuous loop in his home according to his aides he watched it  times hughes insisted on using tissues to pick up objects to insulate himself from germs he would also notice dust stains or other imperfections on peoples clothes and demand that they take care of them once one of the most visible men in america hughes ultimately vanished from public view although tabloids continued to follow rumors of his behavior and whereabouts he was reported to be terminally ill mentally unstable or even dead injuries from numerous aircraft crashes caused hughes to spend much of his later life in pain and he eventually became addicted to codeine which he injected intramuscularly hughes had his hair cut and nails trimmed only once a year likely due to the pain caused by the rsdcrps which was caused by the plane crashes he also stored his urine in bottles hughes had this  chrysler new yorker equipped with an aircraftgrade air filtration system that took up the entire trunk later years as a las vegas recluseedit the wealthy and aging hughes accompanied by his entourage of personal aides began moving from one hotel to another always taking up residence in the top floor penthouse in the last ten years of his life  to  hughes lived in hotels in many cities—including beverly hills boston las vegas nassau freeport vancouver london managua and acapulco on november   thanksgiving day hughes arrived in las vegas by railroad car and moved into the desert inn because he refused to leave the hotel and to avoid further conflicts with the owners hughes bought the desert inn in early  the hotels eighth floor became the nerve center of hughes empire and the ninthfloor penthouse became his personal residence between  and  he bought several other hotelcasinos including the castaways new frontier the landmark hotel and casino and the sands he bought the small silver slipper casino for the sole purpose of moving its trademark neon silver slipper visible from hughes bedroom it had apparently kept him awake at night after hughes left the desert inn hotel employees discovered that his drapes had not been opened during the time he lived there and had rotted through an unusual incident marked an earlier hughes connection to las vegas during his  engagement at the last frontier hotel flamboyant entertainer liberace mistook howard hughes for his lighting director instructing him to instantly bring up a blue light should he start to play clair de lune hughes nodded in compliance—but the hotels entertainment director arrived and introduced hughes to liberace hughes wanted to change the image of las vegas to something more glamorous as hughes wrote in a memo to an aide i like to think of las vegas in terms of a welldressed man in a dinner jacket and a beautifully jeweled and furred female getting out of an expensive car hughes bought several local television stations including klastv hughes considerable business holdings were overseen by a small panel unofficially dubbed the mormon mafia because of the many latterday saints on the committee led by frank william gay in addition to supervising daytoday business operations and hughes health they also went to great pains to satisfy hughes every whim for example hughes once became fond of baskinrobbins banana nut ice cream so his aides sought to secure a bulk shipment for him only to discover that baskinrobbins had discontinued the flavor they put in a request for the smallest amount the company could provide for a special order  gallons  l and had it shipped from los angeles a few days after the order arrived hughes announced he was tired of banana nut and wanted only french vanilla ice cream the desert inn ended up distributing free banana nut ice cream to casino customers for a year in a  interview ex–howard hughes communicator robert maheu said there is a rumor that there is still some banana nut ice cream left in the freezer it is most likely true as an owner of several major las vegas businesses hughes wielded much political and economic influence in nevada and elsewhere during the s and early s he disapproved of underground nuclear testing at the nevada test site hughes was concerned about the risk from residual nuclear radiation and attempted to halt the tests when the tests finally went through despite hughes efforts the detonations were powerful enough that the entire hotel where he was staying trembled due to the shock waves in two separate lastditch maneuvers hughes instructed his representatives to offer milliondollar bribes to both presidents lyndon b johnson and richard nixon in  jean peters filed for divorce the two had not lived together for many years peters requested a lifetime alimony payment of  a year adjusted for inflation and waived all claims to hughes estate hughes offered her a settlement of over a million dollars but she declined it hughes did not insist on a confidentiality agreement from peters as a condition of the divorce aides reported that hughes never spoke ill of her she refused to discuss her life with hughes and declined several lucrative offers from publishers and biographers peters would state only that she had not seen hughes for several years before their divorce and had only dealt with him by phone hughes was living in the intercontinental hotel near lake managua in nicaragua seeking privacy and security when a magnitude  earthquake damaged managua in december  as a precaution hughes moved to the nicaraguan national palace and stayed there as a guest of anastasio somoza debayle before leaving for florida on a private jet the following day he subsequently moved into the penthouse at the xanadu princess resort on grand bahama island which he had recently purchased he lived almost exclusively in the penthouse of the xanadu beach resort  marina for the last four years of his life hughes had spent a total of  million on his many properties in las vegas memoir hoaxedit in  author clifford irving caused a media sensation when he claimed he had cowritten an authorized autobiography of hughes hughes was so reclusive that he did not immediately publicly refute irvings statement leading many to believe the irving book was genuine however before the books publication hughes finally denounced irving in a teleconference and the entire project was eventually exposed as a hoax irving was later convicted of fraud and spent  months in prison in  the orson welles film f for fake included a section on the hughes biography hoax in  the hoax by clifford irving was published in the united kingdom

methodist hospital in houston texas other accounts indicate that he died on the flight from freeport grand bahama to houston after receiving a call his senior counsel frank p morse ordered his staff to get his body on a plane and return him to the united states it was common that foreign countries would hold a corpse as ransom so that an estate could not be settled morse ordered the pilots to

first cousin william lummis and  million split equally between his two exwives ella rice and jean peters in this will hughes left his entire estate to the hughes medical institute as he had no connection to family and was seriously ill this is contrary to the many wills that have surfaced after his death the original will that included payments to aides never surfaced it was apparently in a home surrounding the desert inn golf course belonging to the mother of an assistant he had no desire to leave any money to family aides or churches including william gay and frank morsefull citation needed hughes was not mormon and had no reason to leave his estate to that church frank p morse is still the attorney of record for hughes gay has devoted his life to the church of jesus christ of latterday saintsfull citation needed a further  million was endowed to a gasstation owner melvin dummar who told reporters that late one evening in  he found a disheveled and dirty man lying along us

death a mysterious man appeared at his gas station leaving an envelope containing the will on his desk unsure if the will was genuine and unsure of what to do dummar left the will at the lds church

engineers to design a customized bed equipped with hot and cold running water built in six sections and operated by  electric motors with pushbutton adjustments the hospital bed was designed by hughes specifically to alleviate the pain caused by moving with severe burn injuries despite the fact that he never had the chance to use the bed that he designed hughes bed served as a prototype for the modern hospital bed hughes doctors considered his recovery almost miraculous hughes however believed that neither miracle nor modern medicine contributed to his recovery instead asserting the natural

office in late  donald nixon was collecting intelligence for his brother in preparation for the upcoming presidential election one of donalds sources was john h meier a former business adviser of hughes who had also worked with democratic national committee chair larry obrien meier in collaboration with former vice president hubert humphrey and others wanted to feed misinformation to the nixon campaign meier told donald that he was sure the democrats would win the election because larry obrien had a great deal of information on richard nixons illicit dealings with howard hughes that had never been released obrien did not actually have any such information but meier wanted nixon to think he did donald told his brother that obrien was in possession of damaging hughes information that could destroy his campaign terry lenzner who was the chief investigator for the senate watergate committee speculates that it was nixons desire to know what obrien knew about nixons dealings with hughes that may have partially motivated the watergate breakin physical declineedit hughes was eccentric and suffered from a severe obsessivecompulsive disorder close friends of hughes reported that he was obsessed with the size of peas one of his favorite foods and used a special fork to sort them by size while directing the outlaw hughes became fixated on a small flaw in one of jane russells blouses claiming that the fabric bunched up along a seam and gave the appearance of two nipples on each breast he wrote a detailed memorandum to the crew on how to fix the problem richard fleischer who directed his kind of woman with hughes as executive producer wrote at length in his autobiography about the difficulty of dealing with the tycoon in his book just tell me when to cry fleischer

completed in  hughes told his aides that he wanted to screen some movies at a film studio near his home he stayed in the studios darkened screening room for more than four months never leaving he ate only chocolate bars and chicken and drank only milk and was surrounded by dozens of kleenex boxes that he continuously stacked and rearranged he wrote detailed memos to his aides giving them explicit instructions not to look at him nor speak to him unless spoken to throughout this period hughes sat fixated in his chair often naked continually watching movies when he finally emerged in the summer of  his hygiene was terrible he had not bathed nor cut his hair and nails for weeks this may have been due to allodynia which results in a pain response to stimuli that would normally not cause pain after the screening room incident hughes moved into a bungalow at the beverly hills hotel where he also rented rooms for his aides his wife and numerous girlfriends he would sit naked in his bedroom with a pink hotel napkin placed over his genitals watching movies this may have been because hughes found the touch of clothing painful due to allodynia he may have watched movies to distract himself from his pain—a common practice among patients with intractable pain especially those who do not receive adequate treatment in one year hughes spent an estimated  million at the hotel hughes began purchasing all restaurant chains and four star hotels that had been founded within the state of texas this included if for only a short period many unknown franchises currently out of business he placed ownership of the restaurants with the howard hughes medical institute and all licenses were resold shortly after another time he became obsessed with the  film ice station zebra and had it run on a continuous loop in his home according to his aides he watched it  times hughes insisted on using tissues to pick up objects to insulate himself from germs he would also notice dust stains or other imperfections on peoples clothes and demand that they take care of them once one of the most visible men in america hughes ultimately vanished from public view although tabloids continued to follow rumors of his behavior and whereabouts he was reported to be terminally ill mentally unstable or even dead injuries from numerous aircraft crashes caused hughes to spend much of his later life in pain and he eventually became addicted to codeine which he injected intramuscularly hughes had his hair cut and nails trimmed only once a year likely due to the pain caused by the rsdcrps which was caused by the plane crashes he also stored his urine in bottles hughes had this  chrysler new yorker equipped with an aircraftgrade air filtration system that took up the entire trunk later years as a las vegas recluseedit the wealthy and aging hughes accompanied by his entourage of personal aides began moving from one hotel to another always taking up residence in the top floor penthouse in the last ten years of his life  to  hughes lived in hotels in many cities—including beverly hills boston las vegas nassau freeport vancouver london managua and acapulco on november   thanksgiving day hughes arrived in las vegas by railroad car and moved into the desert inn because he refused to leave the hotel and to avoid further conflicts with the owners hughes bought the desert inn in early  the hotels eighth floor became the nerve center of hughes empire and the ninthfloor penthouse became his personal residence between  and  he bought several other hotelcasinos including the castaways new frontier the landmark hotel and casino and the sands he bought the small silver slipper casino for the sole purpose of moving its trademark neon silver slipper visible from hughes bedroom it had apparently kept him awake at night after hughes left the desert inn hotel employees discovered that his drapes had not been opened during the time he lived there and had rotted through an unusual incident marked an earlier hughes connection to las vegas during his  engagement at the last frontier hotel flamboyant entertainer liberace mistook howard hughes for his lighting director instructing him to instantly bring up a blue light should he start to play clair de lune hughes nodded in compliance—but the hotels entertainment director arrived and introduced hughes to liberace hughes wanted to change the image of las vegas to something more glamorous as hughes wrote in a memo to an aide i like to think of las vegas in terms of a welldressed man in a dinner jacket and a beautifully jeweled and furred female getting out of an expensive car hughes bought several local television stations including klastv hughes considerable business holdings were overseen by a small panel unofficially dubbed the mormon mafia because of the many latterday saints on the committee led by frank william gay in addition to supervising daytoday business operations and hughes health they also went to great pains to satisfy hughes every whim for example hughes once became fond of baskinrobbins banana nut ice cream so his aides sought to secure a bulk shipment for him only to discover that baskinrobbins had discontinued the flavor they put in a request for the smallest amount the company could provide for a special order  gallons  l and had it shipped from los angeles a few days after the order arrived hughes announced he was tired of banana nut and wanted only french vanilla ice cream the desert inn ended up distributing free banana nut ice cream to casino customers for a year in a  interview ex–howard hughes communicator robert maheu said there is a rumor that there is still some banana nut ice cream left in the freezer it is most likely true as an owner of several major las vegas businesses hughes wielded much political and economic influence in nevada and elsewhere during the s and early s he disapproved of underground nuclear testing at the nevada test site hughes was concerned about the risk from residual nuclear radiation and attempted to halt the tests when the tests finally went through despite hughes efforts the detonations were powerful enough that the entire hotel where he was staying trembled due to the shock waves in two separate lastditch maneuvers hughes instructed his representatives to offer milliondollar bribes to both presidents lyndon b johnson and richard nixon in  jean peters filed for divorce the two had not lived together for many years peters requested a lifetime alimony payment of  a year adjusted for inflation and waived all claims to hughes estate hughes offered her a settlement of over a million dollars but she declined it hughes did not insist on a confidentiality agreement from peters as a condition of the divorce aides reported that hughes never spoke ill of her she refused to discuss her life with hughes and declined several lucrative offers from publishers and biographers peters would state only that she had not seen hughes for several years before their divorce and had only dealt with him by phone hughes was living in the intercontinental hotel near lake managua in nicaragua seeking privacy and security when a magnitude  earthquake damaged managua in december  as a precaution hughes moved to the nicaraguan national palace and stayed there as a guest of anastasio somoza debayle before leaving for florida

penthouse of the xanadu beach resort  marina for the last four years of his life hughes had spent a total of  million on his many properties in las vegas memoir hoaxedit in  author clifford irving caused a media sensation when he claimed he had cowritten an authorized autobiography of hughes hughes was so reclusive that he did not immediately publicly refute irvings statement leading many to believe the irving book was genuine however before the books publication hughes finally denounced irving in a teleconference and the entire project was eventually exposed as a hoax irving was later convicted of fraud and spent  months in prison in  the orson welles film f for fake included a section on the hughes biography hoax in  the hoax by clifford irving was published in the united kingdom

first cousin william lummis and  million split equally between his two exwives ella rice and jean peters in this will hughes left his entire estate to the hughes medical institute as he had no connection to family and was seriously ill this is contrary to the many wills that have surfaced after his death the original will that included payments to aides never surfaced it was apparently in a home surrounding the desert inn golf course belonging to the mother of an assistant he had no desire to leave any money to family aides or churches including william gay and frank morsefull citation needed hughes was not mormon and had no reason to leave his estate to that church frank p morse is still the attorney of record for hughes gay has devoted his life to the church of jesus christ of

rko a struggling major hollywood studio by acquiring  of the outstanding stock from floyd odlums atlas corporation within weeks of acquiring the studio hughes dismissed threequarters of the work force and production was shut down for six months during which time investigations were conducted of each employee who remained with rko as far as their political leanings were concerned only after ensuring that the stars under contract to rko had no suspect affiliations would hughes approve completed pictures to be sent back for reshooting this was especially true of the women who were under contract to rko at that time if hughes felt that his stars did not properly represent the political views of his liking or if a films anticommunist politics were not sufficiently clear he pulled the plug in  an

as part of the settlement of the united states v paramount pictures inc antitrust case as a result of the hearings the shaky status of rko became increasingly apparent a steady stream of lawsuits from

aircraft manufacturing and twa holdings during the korean war years hughes offered to buy out all other stockholders in order to dispense with their distractions he had gained neartotal control of rko

virtual end of his year involvement in the motion picture industry however his reputation as a financial wizard emerged unscathed during that time period rko became known as the home of film noir classic productions thanks in part to the limited budgets required to make such films during hughes tenure hughes reportedly walked away from rko having made  million in personal profit general tire

office in late  donald nixon was collecting intelligence for his brother in preparation for the upcoming presidential election one of donalds sources was john h meier a former business adviser of hughes who had also worked with democratic national committee chair larry obrien meier in collaboration with former vice president hubert humphrey and others wanted to feed misinformation to the nixon campaign meier told donald that he was sure the democrats would win the election because larry obrien had a great deal of information on richard nixons illicit dealings with howard hughes that had never been released obrien did not actually have any such information but meier wanted nixon to think he did donald told his brother that obrien was in possession of damaging hughes information that could destroy his campaign terry lenzner who was the chief investigator for the senate watergate committee speculates that it was nixons desire to know what obrien knew about nixons dealings with

instructions not to look at him nor speak to him unless spoken to throughout this period hughes sat fixated in his chair often naked continually watching movies when he finally emerged in the summer

after the screening room incident hughes moved into a bungalow at the beverly hills hotel where he also rented rooms for his aides his wife and numerous girlfriends he would sit naked in his bedroom
