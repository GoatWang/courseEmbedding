seasoned medical intuitive and has a gift for healing this enables her to give you fast indepth insight in your sessions lana has firsthand experience of being completely healed with the techniques used in the body codewhat is proxy testing and how is it doneif you have read the emotion code you have gained an understanding of proxy testing in case you need to refresh your memory i have excerpted portions of the emotion code below for your reviewwhen someone has been given authority to act for someone else we commonly refer to the authorized person as a proxy a proxy is someone who acts as a substitute in proxy testing the proxy temporarily “becomes” the person being tested by voluntarily putting themselves into the position of standing in for someone else a proxy can be tested as if they were the subject of the testing allowing their body to be used to benefit the subject proxy testing is most useful when you want to help someone who is not present or who is inaccessible for some reason when you release trapped emotions from someone at a distance it is literally a form of remote or distance healing although remote healing has not been incorporated into western medicine it has been practiced both anciently and in modern times by those who practice the silva method qigong gungfu reiki and other respected techniquestestimonialshealing allison in japani once worked with a number of ballerinas from a local dance school near my practice allison one of the dancers that i had been treating went to japan to dance with a group from disneyland late one night i got a phone call from allison’s worried mother “doctor nelson we have a big problem” she said “allison has hurt her hip and can’t dance she is supposed to be in a big show tomorrow is there anything you can do” i told her i’d like to speak to allison so she gave me the number of her hotel in japan when i reached her allison described the problem with her hip and said it had started bothering her that day for no apparent reason and that she was having difficulty walking dancing the next day was out of the question having gotten permission from allison’s mother and from allison to test her i asked jean to act as proxy although allison was literally on the other side of the earth we had no problem making the connection we chose to call allison on the phone in this situation to get her input but it’s important to note that proxy testing can be done without having the subject on the telephone while you are testing them the energetic connection between the proxy and the subject is sufficient distance is no barrier to energy energy is truly everywhere and fills the world and indeed fills the immensity of space there is as much energy in the air between objects as there is in the objects themselves since energy is continuous and everywherepresent working on allison presented no difficulty we discovered that allison had two trapped emotions lodged in the tissues of her hip the trapped emotions had to do with loneliness and grief over her trip to japan “do you feel that you don’t want to be in japan” i asked allison on the phone she grudgingly admitted it was true “it’s exciting to be here and all” she said “but i’m very homesick i miss my mom and my friends i just really don’t want to be here and i wish i could go home” by running a magnet down jean’s back we released the two trapped emotions from allison even though allison was halfaworld away in japan the results were instantaneous before we hung up the phone with allison her hip pain was entirely gone she went on stage the next day and danced without any problem dorene’s remote experiencea patient named dorene wanted to share this story about how remote healing was just as effective for her as being there in person i have seen dr nelson intermittently over the last 0 years or so for various problems i had been suffering for several days with the symptoms of a hiatal hernia including heartburn and pain i was really miserable and i wasn’t getting anything done my husband rick and i were sitting in our family room when rick decided to make a phone call to dr nelson to see if there was anything that he could do to help me he found through testing that my symptoms were being caused by a trapped emotion and he treated it i can honestly say that the relief was instantaneous as we were sitting there and the symptoms completely left me before the phone conversation was over i highly recommend that people be open to this type of treatment there are wonderful discoveries available to us today through remote treatments by those who are knowledgeable  dorene n disclaimer releasing trapped emotions using the emotion code or any other type of energy healing practiced by the

bradley nelson is a chiropractor and craniopath who calls himself a renowned holistic physician and lecturer and calls his special secrets of healing the emotion code and the body code he bases his healing methods on an eclectic union of energy healing kirlian photography applied kinesiology magnet therapy and a belief that the unconscious mind records everything one ever experiences and is the key to perfect health and happiness like many other healers whose imaginations seem to be their main driving force nelson believes there is only one cause and one cure for all illnesses nelson claims to have gained his healing knowledge from a higher power through some sort of silent prayer he begins his webinars and healing sessions with  seconds of silence to invoke the help of something upstairs he claims his healing crosses many borders he can heal depression relationships and bodiesall with one magical system that can take place in just a few minutes and can be done at a distance here is what you can do with nelsons body code feel more emotionally connected with others than ever before experience the lightness of releasing your trapped emotional baggage be empowered to communicate with your own subconscious learn the hottest techniques to tap into your own internal computer acquire amazing tools to help your friends and loved ones discover the unseen causes of illness most doctors arent aware of internalize and practice healing methods known only to a few discern your real health challenge and know what to do about it now learn to communicate with and heal your animals and pets im pretty sure that my doctor doesnt know how to use magnets or his subconscious mind to heal pets or release trapped emotions many of nelsons claims are preposterous for example he claims that we inherit trapped emotions from parents and ancestors and that the subconscious stores every detail of every experience weve ever had even so some preposterous claims may resonate with many brokenhearted people perhaps the most important discovery that dr nelson has made is that trapped emotional energies will often gather around the heart creating a heartwall that may block you from giving and receiving love freely if he were speaking metaphorically i think id agree with him but id have to point out that this isnt a scoop but nelson means it literally energy is not a metaphor it is literally surrounding the heart which apparently is the literal seat of giving and receiving love to which one can only say nelson you should take some lessons in anatomy physiology and neurology to learn more about the emotions and the chemicals involved in feelings some of nelsons claims are popular myths among the holistic antiscientific medicine crowd for example he passes on the tale that has been a favorite among this crowd for many years that prescription drugs are the third leading cause of death for those who care this is a lie bradleys contribution to the lie is to claim that normal use of prescription drugs is the third leading cause of death in the us the centers for disease controla much better source than nelson bradleyreport that in  the number three cause of death in the us was stroke with  deaths number one was heart disease with  deaths and number two was cancer with  i dont doubt that nelson has some satisfied customers and can whip up a frenzied page of testimonials should he so desire but his healing methods are not based on solid science i would be a bit suspicious of anyone who claims he knows something the entire scientific community has missed anyway there is no reason to believe that energy healing of any kind is anything but placebo medicine there is no justification for belief in muscle testing applied kinesiology as valid for anything kirlian photography does not prove energy fields exist around all living things there is no evidence that magnets can untrap emotions whatever that might mean all in all i would have to say that if you seek treatment from nelson you are a believer in faith healing anyway i wouldnt see a chiropractor for emotional problems make sure you read his disclaimer the statements on this website

ret dr brad   00t i want to tell you the story about how i began on my healing journey… my name is dr bradley nelson dc ret and i am one of those lucky people who was blessed to discover an incredible secret that i want to share with you it is a secret that has transformed my life and the lives of thousands of people across the world…and i know it will do the same for you now before we go on to that i want to share with you an inspiring story it’s the story of how i found my true calling and why i must share this knowledge with you… overcoming a debilitating disease as a  year old boy… when i was  years old i was diagnosed with kidney disease at the hospital the doctors told us that there was no treatment for what i had they told me to be careful not to run or play too hard because it could be dangerous i remember thinking that they didn’t really need to tell me that because just walking would sometimes create pain in my back that would make me feel like i had been stabbed with a knife since this disease was potentially fatal and since there was no medical treatment for it my parents decided to try an alternative they took me to see a couple of osteopathic doctors who practiced and lived in a trailer house situated in the middle of a field on the outskirts of town their names were dr alan bain and dr ida harmon “doc and ida” started working on me and within a couple of weeks i felt much betterthe pain that i had been experiencing was much less frequent and much less severe after about a month i had just about forgotten that i was ever sick my parents took me back to the clinic where they ran the tests on me again the tests were all negative and as i recall that was the st time i ever heard the phrase “spontaneous remission” “whatever we did must’ve worked” – but of course they hadn’t done anything i knew in my heart that what my “alternative doctors” had done had worked finding my true calling i decided then and there that i wanted to be a doctor when i grew up but not just any kind of dr i wanted to be that kind of doctor if i had to practice in a trailer house in the middle of a muddy field that was okay with me doc and ida treated people by the busload who’d come to them from all over even from other states they were miracle workers and my life would never be the same after my experience with them i remember very distinctly lying on my back on their table during a treatment session and telling dr harmon “when i grow up i want to do what you do” she replied “no you don’t if you go to school you’ll never learn the right way to heal they’ll fill your head so full of dogma and nonsense that you’ll never be able to think for yourself again” maybe it was my age but for some reason this advice really stayed with me a detour into the world of computer programming as the years went on my dream of being a healer started to fade a bit i was introduced to computer programming in college and i loved it i loved business and decided that i wouldn’t go into the healing arts after all instead i was going to become a businessman when i was about  months away from starting the mba program at brigham young university my wife jean and i went home to montana for christmas as we were sitting with my mother and father in their living room my father suddenly asked me “are you sure you don’t want to go to chiropractic school you’ve always wanted to do that and it seems like a really great career” i replied that “no i’ve decided to get my mba so i’m really going in a different direction” he said “well why don’t you think about it one more time” i told him that i would receiving direction from above later that evening jean and i drew up a pro and con list on one side was chiropractic and on the other side was the mba and the business world the list was a little longer on the chiropractic side but i wasn’t convinced however i was now not so sure what i really wanted to do i had thought that my mind was made up but now i felt like i was being torn between two exciting futures when jean and i got married we made an agreement that we would never make any momentous or important decision without praying about it to see if it was right this was definitely one of those momentous decisions so that night found me on my knees i essentially said “father in heaven if it makes any difference to you please help me to know what direction to go i will go either way” i was awakened in the middle of the night with my mind full of thoughts about healing and how wonderful it is to be able to serve other people that way i remember thinking “well yes that’s true but this other direction is good too…” i had this experience  times that night i woke up  times and each time my mind was full of these “warm fuzzy feelings” about going into the healing arts nevertheless i wasn’t convinced do i seem a bit thick headed to you the single most pivotal moment in my life… the next night found me on my knees once again asking god for guidance and this was a night that i will never forget if i live to be one million years old this night like the night before i was awakened  times and each time i was awakened my mind was filled with the same thoughts as the night before but somehow these feelings became progressively stronger and more powerful each time i was awakened the third time that i woke up that night my mind was overflowing with thoughts of service to mankind and to humanity it’s impossible for me to describe what this experience was like the feelings were absolutely overwhelming and as my head was filled with thoughts of healing and helping the world a voice spoke to me that voice was crystal clear and it was as distinct and audible as anything i’ve ever heard it said “this is a sacred calling” the body is a sacred temple i’ve reflected on this experience many times since then and i believe because the human body is actually a sacred “temple” for our spirit to inhabit that any time we are working to help that body function better we are doing a sacred thing if we are sewing up an injury if we are helping someone who is disabled if we are healing someone who is in need of healing we are doing a sacred thing i ended up going to chiropractic school later that year it was one of the great experiences of my life and thanks to my classmates it was a truly enlightening experience but even so i was very much on guard i remembered ida’s warning to me from many years before that i would lose the ability to think for myself no matter what healing method was taught by my instructors as being the “best way” to fix this or that problem my attitude was always “well maybe maybe not maybe there’s a better way to do this it just hasn’t been figured out yet” computer programming and the healing arts by this time i had become pretty good at computer programming in fact i was able to help put myself through chiropractic school by programming the admissions software that our college used i remember my instructors saying how the brain is the most sophisticated computer in the known universe and i can remember thinking “wow if the brain is really a computer will we ever have the ability to access the data that must be stored in there because if we could it would be amazing” i figured that someday as technology advanced we might eventually gain this ability little did i know how accessing the subconscious database would affect my practice and the rest of my life when i went into practice for myself one of the very first patients that i treated was a man who weighed about 0 pounds he was in tears because he was in so much pain i remember feeling a sense of panic wondering “how can i know what this man really needs what if i don’t do the right thing how can i really help this man to get well as quickly as possible” my first contact with the power of the body code i said a silent prayer to god at that point “father in heaven you got me into this you need to help me now if you will” and he did somehow i was able to help that man to get out of pain in short order i came to rely on prayer i prayed all the time for help although no one knew it i practiced for 0 years in one form or another and it was my habit to ask a short silent prayer of help for each patient that i treated each time i treated them i prayed that god would give me the “gift of healing” one of the spiritual gifts that are spoken of in the scriptures i think i pestered him for that gift on a daily basis for at least 0 years i learned for myself that prayers are answered my patients got well there were times especially during the last years that i was in practice when the patient might present a problem that i didn’t know how to deal with something that i had never seen before and there were times when in answer to my silent prayer of help the information i needed to know would instantly flood into my mind sometimes this information was a completely different way of looking at things than i had never even considered before leaving my practice to spread the power of the body code i loved my patients i considered them my good friends leaving my practice was one of the hardest things that i ever had to do i was a bit like marcus welby md if you’re old enough to remember marcus welby was a medical doctor and probably the st “dr show” that appeared on tv during my childhood in the 0s it was one of my favorite shows and for some strange reason it made a huge impact on me dr welby was general practitioner a “family dr” he took care of families and the show was always interesting because you never knew what was going to happen from one episode to the next sometimes i felt like a family doctor myself i took care of families in many cases working with everything from childhood asthma to the problems of old age “if we can find those imbalances and fix them perhaps your symptoms will go away” as time went on my patient’s problems seemed to increase in complexity as my ability to help them increased the last 0 years that i spent in practice i specialized in working with people who were suffering from conditions that were considered “incurable” by western medicine complex problems like fibromyalgia chronic fatigue syndrome lupus and even cancer consistently i told these patients “i don’t treat diseases i don’t claim to cure diseases i simply try to find the imbalances that are going on in the body i believe that the symptoms that you are having are because of imbalances that are going on in your body if we can find those imbalances and fix them perhaps your symptoms will go away” and go away they did during those years i saw patients with these difficult problems from all over the us and canada the vast majority of them got well and quite rapidly i didn’t end up helping everyone and my success rate was not  but it was very close to  teaching others to help themselves… somewhere along the line i developed this very powerful feeling that people could do a lot to help themselves i had this deep driving urge to empower people i begin teaching seminars to do just that in  and taught as many seminars to as many people as i could around the us and canada for many years but i was wearing myself out i was working in my practice 0 hours a week and then flying off on weekends teaching seminars and my family was suffering for it in  i got a message from “upstairs” that i needed to turn my practice over to someone else and sell everything i owned it had become clear to me that these healing methods that i developed were not just for me or my patients these healing methods that i had developed were for the whole world…including you letting go of emotional baggage with the emotion code i had to get out of practice so that i would have time to write “the emotion code” i left practice in  and in june of  i published “the emotion code” the success of that book has been astonishing to me it taught me how powerful the written word is there are people now on every continent and in nearly every country who are using the emotion code to get rid of their own emotional baggage and the best part is that they are helping their loved ones to do the same i get emails every day from people whose lives are changing who are falling in love for the first time because they got rid of their heartwall people who are getting rid of their anxiety panic attacks phobias depression as well as their pain and discomfort i’ve been all over the world teaching the emotion code seminar from australia to germany from toronto to auckland from seattle to new york city from dublin to amsterdam the emotion code is only one small piece of a larger picture… but the emotion code was only one piece of the puzzle since our “trapped emotions” are the single most common kind of imbalance that we suffer from it was the first piece of healing information that i needed to get out to the world the truth was that even with its worldwide popularitythe emotion code was just the tip of the iceberg the entire system that i had put together during those years that i was in practice a system that i called “the body code” was the essential groundbreaking “missing piece” that i now needed to share with the world my secret weapon computer programming and the subconscious mind because of my years as a computer programmer i was always trying to combine the use of a computer with the healing work that i was doing the body code was developed in response to my need to figure out what was really wrong with people in the absolute shortest timeframe possible i ran my practice in such a way that i had about 0 minutes per patient visit that might not seem like a whole lot of time and it’s not i knew other holistic practitioners who would easily spend an hour with a patient but i had a secret weapon and that was the ability to access their subconscious mind through muscle testing as time went on i developed a “mind mapping” system that was perfect for my needs after the emotion code was published i had a vague idea in the back of my mind that eventually i would teach the body code system to doctors although i had taught it in seminars before i had no plans to teach it again as i was putting all of my effort into getting the emotion code out to the world however that was about to change “share this knowledge with everyone…” one early morning in august of  i woke up to find my mind full of a very specific instruction to “take all the information that you have gained take everything that you have learned about healing and put it into a selfstudy course that anyone can use and learn and make it available to everyone everywhere” it’s hard to describe how crystalclear this instruction was there was no question that this is what i was supposed to do yet for just a moment the thought of how much work this was going to be made me look upward and ask “are you sure about this” there was no response to this question but i wasn’t expecting one really i spent the next year working nonstop on the body code system i would start working on it before the sun was up and often still be working on it after midnight it’s really more a matter of “remembering” than learning i believe that the body code system is the most advanced method of energetic healing and of natural healing that exists on the planet today it’s really amazing and while i would love to take credit for it i will never do that because i believe that i’m just the messenger i believe that everything that has happened to me in my life has prepared me to be this messenger to bring the body code system to the world to bring the emotion code to the world to give back the healing birthright that belongs to every single one of us to turn us back into the healers that we are capable of being if this story resonates with your heart if you can feel the truth of it then i hope you will join me there is so much you can do to help yourself to get well and stay well there are people all around you who need your help you can help them you can heal their lives it’s really more a matter of “remembering” than learning somewhere deep

earliest use of the word “φύσις” usually translated as nature occurs in homer “hermes gave me the herb drawing it from the ground and showed me its nature” hermes initial function was that of a messenger sent to warn odysseus of the imprisoning wrath of circe in addition hermes wished to demonstrate the qualities of the natural world by using an herb a moly or a white flowered herb with black roots hermes is trying to demonstrate the mundane features of this “magical” white plant eventually the greeks came to see physis as that which is unchanging its counterpoint nomos means “nurture” nomos is that which exists as a result of human belief so the questions went do the gods really exist or do we humans create their existence making them a part of nomos it wasn’t until later that physis came to be known in a more legalistic sense or in the sense of the verb form phusis indicating that nature has a period of growth over time … the title to the touristfacing website for the country of dominica is “discover dominica the nature island” a cursory google image search will show you beautiful foliage cobalt blue waters and relaxing hot springs indeed it would be a perfect place for a vacation the website touts dominica as “the ideal spot for a wedding or honeymoon” implicitly they mean a “natural” wedding or honeymoon dominica is in the news today after two american men were arrested after they were caught engaging in an act of indecent exposure on an atlantis cruise ship it is alleged that they were having sex on their balcony of their rooms while the ship was docked it’s unclear who caught them but the story seems to suggest that a resident of the island caught the two men engaging in an act of buggery a criminal act that carries a maximum 0 year prison sentence homosexuality possesses qualities of both nomos and physis gay sex does indeed occur in the animal kingdom there are species of animals who engage in sexual intercourse regardless of the sex of its partner as a human identity “homosexuality” is a nomos nurtured into existence by the greater society ironically it is less possible to punish the nomos or the aspect of homosexuality that’s culturally fabricated so they go after the physis when one engages in acts of sodomy one has committed a “crime against nature” tellingly the courts in dominica were only able to prosecute on the basis of indecent exposure in other words they exposed themselves as homosexuals and of course the men were set free under certain financial conditions i just finished listening to a wonderful radiolab episode on the english mathematician alan turing he was arrested for “acts of gross indecency” his sentence chemical castration the buggery laws of 0s england were such that one had two choices be imprisoned or take estrogen the latter choice was aimed at erasing the potency of his manhood turing’s career centered around one principle intellectual problem “what if machines become our equivalents” he believed it to have been possible and the english courts decided turing against nature must be stripped of his manhood leave a comment a nietzschean yogi published march  0 by bradley m nelson yoga class was the last place on earth i would expect to be reminded of nietzsche’s view of the historical human yet there i was listening to my instructor’s words of wisdom “live in the past you’re always regretting something live for the future and you’re full of anxiety be here in the present” of course this sentiment smacks of late 0’s be here now counterculture which is far removed from the iron that is the nietzschean übermensch but i find a connection to what we call the “historical human” in his use and abuse of history he says “there is a degree of insomnia of rumination of the historical sense through which something living comes to harm and finally perishes whether it is a person or a people or a culture” one perishes once the “historical sense” finally takes hold completely for some there is only a past that seeks to strangulate the living present in other words a memory is not something that you should hold on to but something that should be discarded and forgotten in order to go about living of course nietzsche was referring to history in a much more universal sense if i may use the words “universal” and “nietzsche” in the same sentence… yet one must personalize this statement after all nietzsche is nothing if not lifeaffirming nietzsche tells us to say yes to life one can easily see how quickly the overman’s horizon begins to broaden but at the very beginning of class today my teacher put on some music for us the music was not exactly my style but then again my “style” of music doesn’t lend itself very well to relaxation and meditation i stopped short when i noticed that the singer sang the word “god” as in “god leads us to the infinite” i’m not exactly militant in my atheism so i let it slide but my teacher warned us that the music “uses the g o d word” and that she had received complaints in the past she explained that the yogic god can be seen that way but should be seen as “energy” a concept that i was familiar with from classes past i wanted to remember to ask her whether the man was an atheist or a christian but i had forgotten and at this point in time i find the answer irrelevant one comment if you liked this angela davis video you might like… published november  0 by bradley m nelson may i ask why in the world is youtube advertising an exgay video to me after watching this clip of angela davis speaking about judith butler’s refusal to accept a german glbt award an event that had escaped my attention back in the summer of  it was bad enough that youtube tried to get me to watch some terrible contemporary horror film trailer after watching clips of the brood on halloween no less what is the meaning of this dreadful misunderstanding leave a comment why demand a center published september  0 by bradley m nelson bulls and bears are inherently peaceful creatures that is only if we leave them alone otherwise they attack ferociously maiming those who dare rouse them from their slumber one gambles when one deals with these unpredictable creatures is wall street as an organic entity parallel to nature itself it certainly is quite moody given to fits of rage and fits of joy in order to make sense of the markets we attach a binary a fertile bull market vs a barren bear market these labels depend on a quantification of wall street’s daily performance when one looks from the broadly focused view of hindsight the status of the markets appear to be a bit more ambiguous based on a more general observation wall street in a constant state of flux there are those who do not wish for a bull market after all there is profit to be squeezed out of a bear market there are companies whose stock profits by laying off hundreds of its employees it appears to be financially responsible and sparks an interest in purchasing its stock only on wall street can a “good” day for some be a “bad” day for all the others it’s the simple laws of capital you win i lose a truly bad day on wall street is a day where everyone breaks even if nothing happens no one wins and no one loses and we all should have just stayed home as if made redundant on a bad day the traders go home with a sense of bored neutrality it has been said that there is no central focus to the wall street occupation but does wall street itself have a central focus one may say that “gaining” money is its purpose but the market isn’t a single organic entity it consists of individual traders who deal with the stocks of individual corporations each gamble against one another poke the bull and it charges disturb the bear and it attacks leave it alone and what happens everyone breaks even no one goes home feeling happy or unhappy wall street would cease to perpetuate its cycle in a world of fox news vs msnbc is it any wonder that we’re taken aback by the lack of a focused soundbite by a lack of a center this movement which started out as a few scattered protesters with a nondescript sense of angst were mocked by the mainstream “left” media yet the protests are gaining momentum as we speak and soon the media may secondguess its paternalistic fingerwaving the organism growing down on wall street will indeed be “too big to ignore” why demand a center when the center no longer holds leave a comment “don’t you want to have a body” published august  0 by bradley m nelson leave a comment democracy published august  0

create the “world’s most valuable company”  billion dollars i don’t care to divide the cost of an iphone into that amount mostly because i know it’s not that simple aweinspiring numbers aside it is quite remarkable what apple has achieved chiefly they have created an army of faithful followers who just gotta’ have that new product regardless of personal necessity and look at what it’s done it’s created a company that possesses a market cap that’s greater than that of exxon mobil our fuel is now plastic and handsomely designed david asked me on the train about how many new yorkers own iphones
