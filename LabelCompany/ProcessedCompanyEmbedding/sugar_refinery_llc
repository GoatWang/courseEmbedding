hawaii commercial sugar hcs sugar mill in puunene hawaii sugar refinery in arabi louisiana united states sugar refinery in groningen the netherlands a sugar refinery is a refinery which processes raw sugar into white refined sugar or that processes sugar beet to refined sugar many cane sugar mills produce raw sugar which is sugar that still contains molasses giving it more colour and impurities than the white sugar which is normally consumed in households and used as an ingredient in soft drinks and foods while cane sugar does not need refining to be palatable sugar from sugar beet is almost always refined to remove the strong almost always unwanted taste of beets from it the refined sugar produced is more than  percent pure sucrose whereas many sugar mills only operate during a limited time of the year during the cane harvesting period many cane sugar refineries work the whole year round sugar beet refineries tend to have shorter periods when they process beet but may store intermediate product and process that in the offseason raw sugar is either processed into white refined sugar in local refineries and sold to the local industry and consumers or it is exported and refined in the country of destination sugar refineries are often located in heavy sugarconsuming regions such as north america europe and japan since the s many stateofthe art sugar refineries have been built in the middle east and north africa region eg in dubai saudi arabia and algeria the world´s largest sugar refinery company is american sugar refining with facilities in north america and

rights reserved skil  sugar refining how sugar is refined  the basic story raw sugar is made in tropical countries where sugar cane can be grown profitably it is then shipped in bulk to a refinery in the country where the sugar is required it now has to be finally cleaned up purified and made ready for the consumer it helps to think of refining as a series of steps from left to right where colour and nonsugars are concentrating to the left and pure sugar is concentrating to the right however the raw sugar comes into the process to the left of centre not at one end in the description that follows the flow of sugar is followed first and then the remainder of the process is reviewed affinationthe first stage of processing the raw sugar is to soften and then remove the layer of mother liquor surrounding the crystals with a process called affination the raw sugar is mixed with a warm concentrated syrup of slightly higher purity than the syrup layer so that it will not dissolve the crystals the resulting magma is centrifuged to separate the crystals from the syrup thus removing the greater part of the impurities from the input sugar and leaving the crystals ready for dissolving before further treatment the liquor which results from dissolving the washed crystals still contains some colour fine particles gums and resins and other nonsugars carbonatationthe first stage of processing the liquor is aimed at removing the solids which make the liquor turbid coincidentally some of the colour is removed too one of the two common processing techniques is known as carbonatation where small clumps of chalk are grown in the juice the clumps as they form collect a lot of the nonsugars so that by filtering out the chalk one also takes out the nonsugars once this is done the sugar liquor is now ready for decolourisation the other technique phosphatation is chemically similar but uses phosphate rather than carbonate formation decolourisationthere are also two common methods of colour removal in refineries both relying on absorption techniques with the liquor being pumped through columns of medium one option open to the refiner is to use granular activated carbon gac which removes most colour but little else the carbon is regenerated in a hot kiln where the colour is burnt off from the carbon the other option is to use an ion exchange resin which removes less colour than gac but also removes some of the inorganics present the resin is regenerated chemically which gives rise to large quantities of unpleasant liquid effluents the clear lightly coloured liquor is now ready for crystallisation except that it is a little too dilute for optimum energy consumption in the refinery it is therefore evaporated prior to going to the crystallisation pan boiling in the pan even more water is boiled off until conditions are right for sugar crystals to grow you may have done something like this at school but probably not with sugar because it is difficult to get the crystals to grow well in the factory the workers throw in some sugar dust to initiate crystal formation once the crystals have grown the resulting mixture of crystals and mother liquor is spun in centrifuges to separate the two rather like washing is spin dried the crystals are then given a final dry with hot air before being packed andor stored ready for despatch recovery the liquor left over from the preparation of white sugar and the washings from the affination stage both contain sugar which it is economic to recover they are therefore sent to the recovery house which operates rather like a raw sugar factory aiming to make a sugar with a quality comparable to the washed raws after the affination stage as with the other sugar processes one cannot get all of the sugar out of the liquor and therefore there is a sweet byproduct made refiners molasses this is usually turned into a cattle food or is sent to a distillery where alcohol is made do you want to
