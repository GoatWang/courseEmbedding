exchange the distributor of any fund may be an “affiliated person” or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of the funds adviser or fund subadviser  shares of each fund will be purchased from the trust only in large aggregations of a specified number referred to as “creation units” creation units may be purchased through orders placed with the distributor by or through an “authorized participant” which is either a a brokerdealer or other participant in the continuous net settlement “cns” system of the national securities clearing corporation “nscc” a clearing agency that is registered with the commission or b a participant “dtc participant” in the depository trust company “dtc” and which in either case has executed a participant agreement with the distributor with respect to the creation and redemption of creation units purchases and redemptions of the funds creation units will be processed either through an enhanced clearing process available to dtc participants that are also participants in the cns system of the nscc the “nscc process” or through a manual clearing process that is available to all dtc participants the “dtc process”  in order to keep costs low and permit each fund to be as fully invested as possible shares will be purchased and redeemed in creation units and generally on an inkind basis accordingly except where the purchase or redemption will include cash under the limited circumstances specified below purchasers will be required to purchase creation units by making an inkind deposit of specified instruments “deposit instruments” and shareholders redeeming their shares will receive an inkind transfer of specified instruments “redemption instruments” on any given business day the names and quantities of the instruments that constitute the deposit instruments and the names and quantities of the instruments that constitute the redemption instruments will be identical and these instruments may be referred to in the case of either a purchase or redemption as the “creation basket” in addition the creation basket will correspond pro rata to the positions in a funds portfolio including cash positions except a in the case of bonds for minor differences when it is impossible to break up bonds beyond certain minimum sizes needed for transfer and settlement b for minor differences when rounding is necessary to eliminate fractional shares or lots that are not tradeable round lots  or c tba transactions short positions and other positions that cannot be transferred in kind  will be excluded from the creation basket if there is a difference between the net asset value “nav” attributable to a creation unit and the aggregate market value of the creation basket exchanged for the creation unit the party conveying instruments with the lower value will also pay to the other an amount in cash equal to that difference the “balancing amount”  purchases and redemptions of creation units may be made in whole or in part on a cash basis rather than in kind solely under the following circumstances a to the extent there is a balancing amount as described above b if on a given business day a fund announces before the open of trading that all purchases all redemptions or all purchases and redemptions on that day will be made entirely in cash c if upon receiving a purchase or redemption order from an authorized participant a fund determines to require the purchase or redemption as applicable to be made start printed page entirely in cash  d if on a given business day a fund requires all authorized participants purchasing or redeeming shares on that day to deposit or receive as applicable cash in lieu of some or all of the deposit instruments or redemption instruments respectively solely because i such instruments are not eligible for transfer through either the nscc process or dtc process or ii in the case of funds holding nonus investments “global funds” such instruments are not eligible for trading due to local trading restrictions local restrictions on securities transfers or other similar circumstances or e if a fund permits an authorized participant to deposit or receive as applicable cash in lieu of some or all of the deposit instruments or redemption instruments respectively solely because i such instruments are in the case of the purchase of a creation unit not available in sufficient quantity ii such instruments are not eligible for trading by an authorized participant or the investor on whose behalf the authorized participant is acting or iii a holder of shares of a fund holding nonus investments would be subject to unfavorable income tax treatment if the holder receives redemption proceeds in kind  each business day before the open of trading on the listing exchange each fund will cause to be published through the nscc the names and quantities of the instruments comprising the creation basket as well as the estimated balancing amount if any for that day the published creation basket will apply until a new creation basket is announced on the following business day and there will be no intraday changes to the creation basket except to correct errors in the published creation basket the listing exchange or a major market data vendor will disseminate every  seconds throughout the trading day an amount representing the funds estimated nav which will be the value of the funds portfolio positions on a per share basis  an investor purchasing or redeeming a creation unit will be charged a fee “transaction fee” to protect continuing shareholders of the funds from the dilutive costs associated with the purchase and redemption of creation units the distributor will deliver a confirmation and fund prospectus “prospectus” to the purchaser in addition the distributor will maintain records of both the orders placed with it and the confirmations of acceptance furnished by it  beneficial owners of shares may sell their shares in the secondary market shares will be listed on a listing exchange and traded in the secondary market in the same manner as other equity securities applicants state that it is expected that one or more specialists or market makers collectively “exchange market makers” will be assigned for the shares of each fund the price of shares trading on the listing exchange will be based on a current bidoffer market transactions involving the sale of shares on the listing exchange will be subject to customary brokerage commissions and charges  applicants expect that purchasers of creation units will include arbitrageurs and that exchange market makers acting in their unique role to provide a fair and orderly secondary market for shares also may purchase creation units for use in their own market making activities applicants expect that secondary market purchasers of shares will include both institutional investors and retail investors applicants state that because the market price of creation units will be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities investors should be able to sell shares in the secondary market at prices that do not vary materially from their nav  neither the trust nor any fund will be advertised or marketed as a conventional openend investment company or mutual fund instead each fund will be marketed as an “activelymanaged exchangetraded fund” any advertising material that describes the features of obtaining buying or selling creation units or buying or selling shares on the listing exchange or where there is reference to redeemability will prominently disclose that shares are not individually redeemable and that owners of shares may acquire shares from a fund and tender those shares for redemption to a fund in creation units only  the funds web site which will be publicly available prior to the public offering of shares will include or will include links to each funds current prospectus which may be downloaded that web site which will be publicly available at no charge will also contain on a per share basis for each fund the prior business days nav and the market closing price or the midpoint of the bidask spread at the time of calculation of such nav the “bidask price” and a calculation of the premium or discount of the market closing price or bidask price against such nav on each business day before commencement of trading in shares on the listing exchange each fund will also disclose on its web site the identities and quantities of its portfolio positions held by the fund that will form the basis for the funds calculation of nav at the end of the business day applicants legal analysis  applicants request an order under section c of the act for an exemption from sections a a d and e of the act and rule c under the act and under sections c and b of the act for an exemption from sections a and a of the actstart printed page   section c of the act provides that the commission may exempt any person security or transaction or any class of persons securities or transactions from any provision of the act if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act section b of the act authorizes the commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section a of the act if evidence establishes that the terms of the proposed transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned and the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of the registered investment company and the general provisions of the act sections a and a of the act  section a of the act defines an “openend company” as a management investment company that is offering for sale or has outstanding any redeemable security of which it is the issuer section a of the act defines a redeemable security as any security other than shortterm paper under the terms of which the holder upon its presentation to the issuer is entitled to receive approximately a proportionate share of the issuers current net assets or the cash equivalent applicants request an order to permit the trust to register as an openend management investment company and redeem shares in creation units only applicants state that each investor is entitled to purchase or redeem creation units rather than trade the individual shares in the secondary market applicants further state that because of the arbitrage possibilities created by the redeemability of creation units it is expected that the market price of an individual share will not vary materially from its nav section d of the act and rule c under the act  section d of the act among other things prohibits a dealer from selling a redeemable security which is currently being offered to the public by or through a principal underwriter except at a current public offering price described in the prospectus rule c under the act generally requires that a dealer selling redeeming or repurchasing a redeemable security do so only at a price based on its nav applicants state that secondary market trading in shares will take place at negotiated prices rather than at the current offering price described in the funds prospectus thus purchases and sales of shares in the secondary market will not comply with section d of the act and rule c under the act applicants request an exemption under section c from these provisions  applicants assert that the concerns sought to be addressed by section d of the act and rule c under the act with respect to pricing are equally satisfied by the proposed method of pricing shares applicants maintain that while there is little legislative history regarding section d its provisions as well as those of rule c appear to have been intended a to prevent dilution caused by certain risklesstrading schemes by principal underwriters and contract dealers b to prevent unjust discrimination or preferential treatment among buyers and c to ensure an orderly distribution of shares by eliminating price competition from brokers offering shares at less than the published sales price and repurchasing shares at more than the published redemption price  applicants state that a secondary market transactions in shares would not cause dilution for owners of such shares because such transactions do not involve the trust or funds as parties and b to the extent different prices exist during a given trading day or from day to day such variances occur as a result of thirdparty market forces such as supply and demand therefore applicants assert that secondary market transactions in shares will not lead to discrimination or preferential treatment among purchasers finally applicants contend that the proposed distribution system will be orderly because arbitrage activity will ensure that the difference between the market price of shares and their nav remains immaterial section e  section e of the act generally prohibits a registered investment company from suspending the right of redemption or postponing the date of payment of redemption proceeds for more than seven days after the tender of a security for redemption applicants observe that the settlement of redemptions of creation units of global funds will be contingent not only on the settlement cycle of the us securities markets but also on the delivery cycles in foreign markets in which those funds invest applicants assert that under certain circumstances the delivery cycles for transferring portfolio positions to redeeming investors coupled with local market holiday schedules may require a delivery process of up to  calendar days applicants therefore request relief from section e in order for each global fund to provide payment or satisfaction of redemptions within the maximum number of calendar days required for such payment or satisfaction in the principal local markets where transactions in its portfolio positions customarily clear and settle but in any event within a period not to exceed fifteen calendar days  applicants submit that congress adopted section e to prevent unreasonable undisclosed or unforeseen delays in the actual payment of redemption proceeds applicants state that allowing redemption payments for creation units of a global fund to be made within  calendar days would not be inconsistent with the spirit and intent of section e applicants state that each global funds statement of additional information “sai” will disclose those local holidays over the period of at least one year following the date of the sai if any that are expected to prevent the delivery of redemption proceeds in seven calendar days and the maximum number of days up to  calendar days needed to deliver the proceeds for that global fund applicants are not seeking relief from section e with respect to global funds that do not effect redemptions of creation units in kind sections a and  of the act  section a and  of the act generally prohibit an affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of such a person “second tier affiliate” from selling any security to or purchasing any security from the company section a of the act defines “affiliated person” to include any person directly or indirectly owning controlling or holding with power to vote  or more of the outstanding voting securities of the other person and any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with the other person section a of the act defines “control” of a fund as “the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies” of the fund and provides that a control relationship will be presumed start printed page where one person owns more than  of another persons voting securities the funds may be deemed to be controlled by an adviser and hence affiliated persons of each other in addition the funds may be deemed to be under common control with any other registered investment company or series thereof advised by an adviser an “affiliated fund”  applicants request an exemption from section a under sections c and b to permit inkind purchases and redemptions of creation units from the funds by persons that are affiliated persons or second tier affiliates of the funds solely by virtue of one or more of the following a holding  or more or more than  of the outstanding shares of one or more funds b an affiliation with a person with an ownership interest described in a or c holding  or more or more than  of the shares of one or more affiliated funds  applicants assert that no useful purpose would be served by prohibiting the affiliated persons described above from making inkind purchases or inkind redemptions of shares of a fund in creation units both the deposit procedures for inkind purchases of creation units and the redemption procedures for inkind redemptions will be effected in exactly the same manner for all purchases and redemptions the valuation of the deposit instruments and redemption instruments will be made in the same manner and in the same manner as the funds portfolio positions regardless of the identity of the purchaser or redeemer except with respect to cash determined in accordance with the procedures described in section ig of the application deposit instruments and redemption instruments will be the same for all purchasers and redeemers therefore applicants state that the inkind purchases and redemptions will afford no opportunity for the specified affiliated persons of a fund to effect a transaction detrimental to other holders of shares of that fund applicants do not believe that inkind purchases and redemptions will result in abusive selfdealing or overreaching of the fund applicants conditions applicants agree that any order of the commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions  as long as the funds operate in reliance on the requested order the shares of the funds will be listed on a listing exchange  neither the trust nor any fund will be advertised or marketed as an openend investment company or a mutual fund any advertising material that describes the purchase or sale of creation units or refers to redeemability will prominently disclose that the shares are not individually redeemable and that owners of the shares may acquire those shares from the fund and tender those shares for redemption to the fund in creation units only  the web site for the funds which is and will be publicly accessible at no charge will contain on a per share basis for each fund the prior business days nav and the market closing price or bidask price and a calculation of the premium or discount of the market closing price or bidask price against such nav  on each business day before commencement of trading in shares on the listing exchange the fund will disclose on its web site the identities and quantities of the portfolio positions held by the fund that will form the basis for the funds calculation of nav at the end of the business day  the adviser or any fund subadviser directly or indirectly will not cause any authorized participant or any investor on whose behalf an authorized participant may transact with the fund to acquire any deposit instrument for the fund through a transaction in which the fund could not engage directly  the requested relief to permit etf operations will expire on

experience and potentially stronger relationships in the fixed income markets purchases of creation units either on an all cash basis or in kind are expected to be neutral to the funds from a tax
