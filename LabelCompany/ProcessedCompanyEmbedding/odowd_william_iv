working on bringing the company current in its financial reporting to the securities and exchange commission sec as we previously shared during the third quarter of  we identified certain errors related to the accounting of an antidilution agreement that was part of a  transaction after an extensive review period we determined that the antidilution agreement should have been accounted for as a derivative liability and changes in the fair value recorded through earnings at each balance sheet date on april   we filed comprehensive form k in which we included restated financials for all required prior periodsin may  our board decided to retain the services of bdo usa llp bdo as our new independent registered public accounting firm we are very thankful to be working with such a prestigious firm with bdo we immediately set out to bring ourselves current with our sec filings consequently during the summer of  we filed quarterly reports on form q for the periods ended march   june   september   march   june   and an annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   with the timely filing of our quarterly report on form q for the second quarter of this year we became current with our sec filingswhile working toward the twin goals of becoming current with our sec filings and maintaining full compliance going forward our primary business focus during  has been devoted to the development of upcoming online digital entertainment commonly referred to as web series we have a slate of several projects in various stages of development and i am very excited to announce our next web series to enter production will be south beach sugar a minute soap opera set amidst dueling record companies on miami beach we anticipate the start of principal photography to occur in february  and most importantly we have secured over  million of advertising commitments against this serieswe believe these early advertising commitments reflect the solid reputation the company has built as a leader in the digital entertainment space having received multiple nominations for original scripted programming at the  streamy awards for our successful web series aim high and cybergeddon we were very fortunate and cybergeddon won for best actress missy peregrym wellknown from her current role as the lead on abcs rookie blue not to be left out aim high starring jackson rathbone twilight and aimee teegarden friday night lights had previously won the writers guild award for outstanding achievement in writing for original new media beyond their critical success both series attracted large audiences online with cybergeddon alone achieving  million page views and  million minutes spent on its site within yahoo furthermore in partnership with domestic and international platforms we have distributed these productions in more than  territories worldwideread morewe expect that the production and distribution of high quality entertainment programming online will be the driver for continued revenue growth for the company in  we feel very strongly that we are in the right space at the right time digital productions are the fastest growing segment in the entertainment industry driven by changes in media consumption the economist reports that us consumers spend  hours and  minutes daily on digital content as compared to  hours and  minutes watching television this is evidenced by the fact that netflix has now surpassed hbo in paid subscribers youtube recently reported that over six billion videos are viewed each month on its site and advertisers have responded increasing their spending on digital projects by  since early  leading advertisingvideoondemand avod platforms including hulu aol youtube and yahoo are continually sourcing quality content to distribute on their sites we believe that premium content is simply more attractive to potential audiences and to leading advertisers who want their products to have brand rub with a south beach sugar rather than with a grainy video of a cat playing the piano thus we believe there is a clear advantage for companies that can produce and distribute high quality digital contentas you can probably tell we at dolphin digital media are excited about our business for  and beyond and as always we thank you for your continued faith and support and we wish you and your families all the best
