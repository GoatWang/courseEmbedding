benefits selfadjusting wheel bearing licensing opportunities patents the coates spherical rotary valve csrv system in the late s and s most vehicles combustion engines in the usa were running at a compression ratio of  to  which resulted in an engine efficiency of approximately  percent the rest of the engine power was lost in friction pumping and heat loss when it was found that lead additives in fuel had an adverse effect on the environment it was removed from the fuel this caused the poppet valves and combustion chamber on poppet valve engines to overheat raising the temperature to in excess of  degrees f and damaging the poppet valvesthe answer to this problem was to lower the compression ratio of all engines to  to  or lower thus reducing efficiency of the combustion engine to approximately  percent this means less miles per gallon mpg lower brake horse power bhp and lower torque the air traveling in through the inlet venturi of a combustion engine inlet travels at a speed of up to ft a second in normally aspirated engines this works fine but in poppet valve engines the bhp and torque decreased as the air traveling in does not increase in speed unless a turbo or supercharger is incorporated at higher rpms the poppet valve tends to float or bounce and is unable to service the cylinder and chamber to capacity with air and fuel mixture this is the reason for adding two extra valves to modern engines causing unburned fuel to escape through the exhaust system which leads to a loss of power lower mpg and produces significant pollutionthe poppet valves stems are lubricated with engine oil which is burned off after a short period of running the stem of the inlet valve system is also lubricated with engine oil which is washed off and inducted into the combustion chamber with air and fuel mixture this slows combustion and produces further emissions and eventually clogs the catalytic convertervariable valve timing has advantages at lower rpms as it can shorten the overlap duration of the valves but has extra moving parts that eventually wear on quick deceleration it can cause piston and valve contact where serious damage can occur poppet valves if not activated with hydraulic systems must have clearance readjusted periodically the successful poppet valve of the original combustion engine has been used and modified continuously until the present however it is the most troublesome part of a combustion engine and has lower efficiency at higher rpms introducing the csrv enginethe coates spherical rotary valve engine is the most advanced in the world with the most positive valving system ever built the breathing capabilities of the system are almost double that of a poppet valve for instance a static test of a fivelitre poppet valve engine on an airflow machine produced a reading of  cubic feet per minute cfm with valve fully opened the fivelitre coates spherical rotary valve engine on the same machine however produced a reading of  cfms fully opened a colossal advantage in airflow comparison a fivelitre poppet vavle engine tested on a dynomometer under the same loads and conditions at  produced  bhp and  foot pounds of torque the maximum rpms on the poppet valve engine were  rpms the spherical rotary valve engine in comparison reached  rpms the coates spherical rotary valve comprises two spherical rotary valves assembled on two separate shafts  one for inlet and one for exhaust they rotate on ceramic carbon bearing with no oil lubrication the spheres do not make contact with any part of the housing the seals are a floating type and are also made of a ceramic material they have two piston rings and are floating in a small cylindertype chamber they are activated by the compression and the combustion strokes of the engine which allows  percent sealing effectiveness when compressedbecause the valves rotate away from the combustion chamber and are vented and charged on the opposite side of each sphere this creates a lower combustion chamber temperature allowing for higher compression ratios to be used thus creating an extremely efficient engine some of the coates spherical rotary combustion engines are at  to   to   to  and  to  compression ratios depending on the application all rights reserved   coates international ltd      terms of use      privacy policy      website by nw design coates

rotary valve system csrv replaces the traditional poppet valves and all their associated parts springs guides seats retainers cotters pushrods cam followers camshaft camshaft bearings and many more parts including the oil animation csrv vs poppet valve the csrv system is comprised of only two moving shafts and does not utilize oil pressure fed bearings or oil spray in fact no engine oil is present in the head of the csrv engine  this means the engine oil does not see the hottest parts of the engine which was the exhaust poppet valves  these extremely hot components usually are engine oil spray cooled  this heat would breakdown the atomic structure of the engine oil thus lowering the oil viscosity therefore oil changes are recommended every  to  miles  on the other hand with the csrv  incorporated in the engine design oil change intervals are extended to approximately  miles or more the constant rotation of the csrv rotate away from the extreme heat of the combustion chamber eliminating the possibility of hot spots in the combustion chamber thus allowing for higher compression chamber ratios to be incorporated in the design of a combustion engine  this results in a higher thermal efficient engine and a more complete combustion that will utilize all of the energy contained in the fuel also reducing harmful emissions high compression ratios in the  and s combustion engines utilized compression ratios of  to  and higher producing higher horsepower hp more torque tq and a higher thermal efficient engine   engine efficiency was at approximately   governments around the world found that tetraethyl lead was the lead component in the gasoline at that time the findings were that this lead component in the fuel was extremely hazardous to human health and the world’s environment it was then removed from the fuel  this caused the high compression automobile engines to develop hot spots in the combustion chamber and the hot spot was found to be the exhaust poppet valve  it was getting red hot causing preignition and damage to the engines  the only remedy for this was to lower the compression ratio of all engines this resulted in a lowering of thermal efficiency from an engine having  efficiency to  to  efficiency  this included the less dense fuel with the lead removed this means for every dollar worth of fuel you put into your vehicle you only get  to  cents of drivability and the other  to  cents are lost through heat friction and pumping losses  we extract out of the earth approximately  barrels of oil daily  barrels of this oil is lost just keeping our engines running  the other  barrels make possible our actual driving motion and at the same time creating insurmountable amounts of other harmful pollutions to be pumped into our atmosphere these are the reasons that compelled founder george coates to develop the csrv combustion engine  the csrv engine utilizes much higher compression ratios and has no hot spots and has a much greater volumetric efficiency creating a higher thermal efficient combustion engine in the  –  and possibly higher  with the ability to utilize alternative fuels these possibilities open up new opportunities to reduce the world’s consumption of oilfossil fuels and reduce the production of harmful emissions that are pumped out into our atmosphere every day and if implemented will reduce the united states’ dependency on imported foreign oilrethinking the internal combustion engine the coates spherical rotary valve engine is the most advanced in the world a conventional piston engine ignites the fuel and air mixture in the combustion cycle and evacuates the gas byproducts in the exhaust cycle these cycles occur thousands of times per minute per cylinder through the rotation of the camshaft a springloaded poppet valve opens to enable the fuel and air mixture to enter the firing chamber during the induction stroke the camshaft then closes the intake valve during the compression and combustion stroke of the cylinder and opens a second springloaded valve to vent the cylinder after ignition these gases then enter the exhaust manifold the parts required for this conventional springloaded valve assembly include items such as springs cotters guides rockers shafts and the valves themselves the valve operates in a vertical position in the cylinder head such that a downward movement opens the valve and allows the introduction or evacuation of gas from the chamber the weakest link in the conventional engine has been the limited effectiveness of the poppet valve the coates engine replaces the poppet valve with a spherical rotary valve thereby creating more efficient and powerful combustion and compression stokes the spherical rotary valve system is made up of spheres rotating on a shaft sandwiched between a split head these spheres are either chain or belt driven via the crankshaft much like an overhead camshaft each sphere rotates against a matching seal between it and the piston one for intake and one for exhaust the spheres have cavities and ports machined into them for the induction of fuel and air on the intake stroke and the evacuation of fired gases on the exhaust stroke this design performs exactly the same function as poppet valves but the design eliminates the poppet valves valve springs guides camshaft pushrods rocker arms and other smaller parts the coates engine operates with over  fewer parts than convention engines in addition the spherical rotary valve combustion engine utilizes a proprietary seal at the intake and exhaust ports of the cylinder to prevent pressure leakage this twopiece seal contacts the peripheral surface of the rotary valve and utilizes the compression and expansion of the fuel and air mixture to create a gastight seal with the valves the lubrication of the rotary valve assembly is accomplished by bronze shaft bearings csrv advantagesthe spherical rotary valve combustion engine possesses several significant advantages over the conventional poppet valve assembly the benefits include the following lower emissions conventional engines run hot due to their inability to disperse heat from the firing chamber the resulting high temperatures break down the oil used to lubricate the valves and produce oxides of nitrogen as well as the usual hydrocarbons in addition oil entering the combustion chamber through the intake valve is continually redirected back into the induction system due to pressure provided by the exhaust valve this process compounds the problem of oil burning in a conventional engine  the coates engine avoids the problem of oil burning by requiring no oil lubricants for the valves moreover the rotation of the spherical valve heads reduces engine temperature by constantly changing the surface exposed to combustion heat by eliminating the use of oil in valve lubrication and lowering operating temperature the coates engine emits significantly lower levels of pollutants than a conventional engine reduced fuel requirements  conventional engines lose power through friction and pumping the spherical rotary valve assembly virtually eliminates engine friction and pumping losses as a result of this operating efficiency engines incorporating the spherical rotary valve design offer higher fuel economy than do conventional engines reduced lubrication requirements  the use of seals and shaft bearing make oil lubrication of the valve heads unnecessary and lower the overall oil requirements of the coates engine in comparison to a conventional engine without the component wear that characterizes typical poppet valve systems engines using the spherical rotary valve design also produce fewer metallic particulates as a result of these factors the spherical rotary valve engine can realize longer maintenance intervals than conventional engines increased engine power  the comparative efficiencies of the spherical rotary valve combustion engine have enabled engine speeds of  rpms in addition the spherical rotary valve design can accommodate markedly higher compression ratios than conventional engines the rotary design provides these exceptionally higher compression ratios with no detectable detonation when utilizing fuels of lower octane ratings these factors coupled with the ability of the rotary valve head to deliver more fuel to the combustion chamber than the poppet valve makes the coates design especially well suited for more powerful engines reduced engine noise and vibration  the spherical rotary valve combustion engine virtually eliminates mechanical clatter one of the sources of engine noise mechanical clatter is a byproduct of the wearing of components inadequate lubrication and components working themselves out of adjustment the operation of cils prototype engines involves a rotary movement of the valve with uniform acceleration and deceleration of the components  without the specific stresses and vibrations inherent in a poppet valve assembly the spherical rotary valve combustion engine runs more quietly than conventional engines alternative fuel adaptability  unlike engines of conventional design the spherical rotary valve assembly can be fit to almost any internal combustion engine from the single cylinder to the largest marine diesel in addition the spherical rotary valve system causes the engine to run far cooler than conventional designs thereby enabling it to utilize lower octane fuels conventional poppet valves run hot due to their inability to disperse heat away from the combustion chamber hot exhaust valves in the conventional valve train system create hot spots which are the primary cause of preignotion unless lead additives are present leadfree gasoline requires the use of longstroke relatively low compression engines in order to function properly without fuel additives high compression ratios can be utilized incorporating the coates more efficient and powerful shortstroke design while maintaining the desirable characteristics of optimum performance using leadfree gasoline the design also allows the use of alternate fuels such as methanol and an alcohol mixture the capability of variable valve timing is a design characteristic that lends itself to alternate fuel compatibility reduced manufacturing costs  utilizing standard production techniques while remaining within acceptable engineering standards and tolerances relating to current production line technology the design can be manufactured at a substantial savings due to the following factors a reduction in the number of engine componentsthe number of components required in the manufacture of the design is approximately  vs  for conventional valve train designs and b all components of the design can be die cast or stamped out resulting in a dramatic reduction of assembly time over conventional engine designs and once assembled requires no further adjustments comparative analysis emissions tests conducted by an independent epacompliant laboratory in usa have confirmed the superiority of coates international csrv engines in producing significantly lower pollutant the following chart presents the emission results as reported by an independent laboratory which tested two vehicles one running with stock engine and the second with stock engine retrofitted with coates csrv system both vehicles were tested in steady state with the following parameters no egr systemwarm up run on dynamometer  minutesengine temperature  degrees finertia load  poundsroad horsepower two catalytic converters installed emission type stock engine csrv engine improvement hc ppm    co ppm    nox ppm    co     each vehicle was tested under various rpm and mph scenarios and the above data represent the best results from the multiple test runs engine dynamicsthe average poppet valve opens a maximum of approximately  millimeters restricting air flow in addition valves in high compression engines cannot open before top dead center if they do they will make contact with the piston and engine destruction occurs the coates spherical rotary valve system can open before top dead center and in fact can open at any desired point this flexibility in breathing ports far exceeds the four poppet valve per cylinder combustion engine and allows the engine to run more effectively poppet valve engines almost always exceed a temperature of  degrees f which in turn at such high temperatures produce oxides of nitrogen which are visible as smog over cities such as los angeles etc the inlet poppet valve stems induct oil through the induction valve guides on the exhaust stroke the poppet exhaust valve stems allow back pressure through the valve guides into the engine casing this pressure is then redirected through the fuel induction system and in turn is reburned in the engine creating yet more hydrocarbons carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide back pressure and oil burning in combustion engines equipped with the coates valve system are substantially reduced principally because the coates system requires no oil lubricants the oilfree environment is possible because the shaft bearings in the system are made of materials which require no lubrication the end result is a significant reduction in hydrocarbon carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide

 sector • capital goods    industry • industrial machinery and components tweet     coates international ltd de business description coates international ltd has been developing over a period of more than  years a patented coates spherical rotary valve® “csrv®” system technology which is adaptable for use in pistondriven internal combustion engines of many types independent testing of various engines in which we incorporated our csrv® system technology “csrv® engines” confirmed meaningful fuel savings when compared with internal combustion engines based on the conventional “poppet valve” assembly prevalent in most internal combustion engines throughout the world in addition our csrv® engines produced only ultralow levels of harmful emissions while in operation engines operating on the csrv® system technology can be powered by a wide selection of fuels we believe that these three major advantages of the csrv® system technology constitute the first revolutionary technological advancement of the internal combustion engine suitable for large scale production since its introduction more than one hundred years ago the csrv® system is designed to replace the intake and exhaust conventional “poppet valves” currently used in almost all pistondriven stationary automotive motorcycle and marine engines unlike conventional valves which protrude into the engine combustion chamber the coates® rotary valve system utilizes spherical valves that rotate in a cavity formed between a twopiece cylinder head the coates rotary valve system uses approximately th the moving parts of conventional poppet valve assemblies as a result of these design improvements management believes that the engines incorporating the coates rotary valve system coates engines® will last significantly longer and will require less lubrication over the life of the engine as compared to conventional engines in addition coates rotary valves can be designed with a larger opening into the engine cylinder than conventional valves so that more fuel and air can be inducted into and expelled from the cylinder in a shorter period of time larger valve openings permit higher revolutionsperminute rpm’s and permit higher compression ratios with lower combustion chamber temperatures allowing the coates engine® to produce more power than equivalent conventional engines the csrv® engine is a highly thermalefficient power unit we have been granted an exclusive license to this technology from our founder george j coates and his son gregory g coates the “coates license agreement” in the territory defined to include north america central america and south america the “americas” since our inception the bulk of our development costs and related operational costs have been funded primarily through cash generated from the sales of our common stock issuances of promissory notes and convertible promissory notes capital contributions sales of a small number of natural gas powered csrv® industrial electric power generator sets “gen sets” a gain on the sale of the land and building that serves as our principal facility from the performance of contractual research and development activities involving the csrv® system technology and the receipt of licensing fees for our csrv® system technology we have completed development of the csrv® system technologybased generator engine and are prepared to commence the production phase of our operations provided we raise sufficient new working capital to first produce and field test a number of additional engine generators we intend to sell the engine generators to almont energy inc “almont” for i a license agreement covering the territory of canada and ii certain rights to a license covering the territory of the united states almont is a privately held independent third party entity based in alberta calgary canada we also intend to enter into licensing arrangements with third party manufacturers with existing industry experience and manufacturing capacity we intend to take advantage of the fact that essentially all the components of the csrv® generator engine may be readily sourced and acquired from subcontractors and accordingly expect to manufacture the engine generator by developing assembly lines within owned manufacturing facilities we intend to initially commence production of gen sets on a small scale this will enable us to prove our concept for the csrv® system technology and we expect this will dovetail with the existing substantial demand in the marketplace we plan to address this demand by establishing large scale manufacturing operations in the united states transitioning to large scale manufacturing is expected to require a substantial increase in our work force and substantial capital expenditures our ability to establish such manufacturing operations recruit plant workers finance initial manufacturing inventories and fund capital expenditures is highly dependent on our ability to successfully raise substantial new working capital in an amount and at a pace which matches our business plans potential sources of such new working capital include sales of our equity andor debt securities through private placement pursuing and entering into additional sublicensing agreements with oem’s andor distributors positive working capital generated from sales of our csrv® products once we raise sufficient new working capital and commence production although we have been successful in raising sufficient working capital to continue our ongoing operations we have encountered very challenging credit and equity investment markets and have not been able to raise sufficient new working capital to enable us to commence production of our csrv® products there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising adequate new working capital or even any new working capital to carry out our business plans the current economic environment which is characterized by tight credit markets investor uncertainty about how to safely invest funds and low investor confidence has introduced additional risk and difficulty to our challenge to secure such additional working capital     view
