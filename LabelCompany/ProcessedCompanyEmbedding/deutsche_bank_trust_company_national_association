including bank statements tax returns ws pay stubs work and personal references and a ton of money all up front before you could get a mortgage approved and receive the keys to your new home but thanks to the big banks and investment firms obscene fraud you can lose your home in the blink of an eye a mortgage servicing companybank simply brings a copy of the original mortgage note where you were forced to sign your life away and an assignment from one of the passthrough company’s that you’ve never even heard of record a new deed and your home is gone the foreclosure documents as you may have been heard by now were not even reviewed in many cases by a human actually reading them robosigners they’re called some signatures were forged some documents were never properly filed or sealed

such they will not be handling the marketing of the property the delay on getting it listed might be due to the type of loan it is if it is a fha or a va loan there are delays in the government marketing until ownership is transfered from deutsche bank the way the property would be transfered from the bank to the government is through a claim being filed by the bank my guess that this loan is tied to one of those programs the fact it is boarded up suggests to me that fha is involved to me because they have regs that stipulate how vacant homes are handled of course others banks secure
