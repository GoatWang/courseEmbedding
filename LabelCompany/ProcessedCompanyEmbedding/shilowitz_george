charlesbank coinvestment partners limited partnership cbsc acquisition inc and cibc capital corporation cibc collectively the charlesbank defendants move for dismissal of the second fourth fifth and sixth causes of action and for partial dismissal of the first cause of action in the complaint pursuant to cplr  seq  defendant george shilowitz moves to dismiss the claims in the complaint asserted against him seq  defendants motions are granted in part and denied in part for the reasons that follow factual background  procedural history as this is a motion to dismiss the facts recited are taken from the complaint and the documentary evidence in  the company was founded by plaintiff matthew r mayers defendant siegel and nonparty david rosenwaksfn complaint ¶¶  the company is a delaware llc that through various subsidiaries provides investment management services ¶  defendant shilowitz became a member of the company in  ¶  on may   the companys operative version of its llc agreement the llc agreement was entered into when cibc became a member ¶¶  this action concerns whether mayers termination from the company was for cause a determination which would result in the forfeiture of half of mayers  equity in the company ¶¶   prior to his termination mayers was the companys general counsel and chief compliance officer ¶  he is a member of the companys board ¶  in  the company began investing its clients money in collateralized debt obligations cdos ¶  a cdo is a special purpose investment vehicle comprised of debt and equityfn a cdo derives revenue from a pool of collateral that is pledged to the cdo and held by a trustee the revenue is paid to the cdos investors pursuant to a waterfall in other words the cdos revenue is paid out to the cdos tranches in descending order with the lower tranches not getting paid until the higher tranches have been paid the lower tranches as a result are riskier investments but provide higher returns the tranches are known as the cdos debt a cdo also has equity which is the riskiest investment since it only makes money if all of the debt tranches are paid cdos often have collateral managers that are charged with selecting and managing the cdos collateral however some cdos such as the cdo at issue in this case do not have collateral managers instead decision making regarding the collateral is placed in the hands of a supermajority of the cdos equity holders thus the owners of a supermajority of the equity control the collateral in  the company had invested its clients money in a cdo called tropic cdo iv tropic ¶¶  the company through a subsidiary purchased a supermajority of tropics equity id the company then attempted to sell tropics collateral to other investors at deeply discounted prices in exchange for a fee called a consent paymentfn id tropics investors viewed the companys actions as a scheme to defraud them by stripping tropics collateral in exchange for a bribe ¶  the company gave up on this scheme after it was sued ¶¶  mayers however created a company called tp investments llc tpi starting in  mayers had tpi buy a supermajority of tropics equity and then attempted to sell tropics collateral in exchange for consent payments the company learned of mayers actions in late  and held a board meeting on december   during which mayers was confronted about his tpi dealings and told to sell his tropic equity additionally in a letter dated january   the company demanded that mayers divest himself of tropic equity or else he would be fired for cause mayers had two choices  get rid of his tropic equity at a loss of  or  refuse get fired for cause and lose half his equity in the company which was worth millions of dollars mayers sold his tropic equity on january   despite acceding to the companys demands mayers was fired for cause mayers maintains that his involvement with tropic is not grounds for termination for cause under the llc agreement section  of the llc agreement requires mayers to devote substantially all of his full professional time to the performance of his duties as an employee of the company however mayers is allowed to make passive investments on his own behalf so long as they do not require any material time consequently mayers is allowed to trade on his own behalf so long as doing so does not cause him to neglect his duties to the company on this motion the parties do not dispute the question of whether the time mayers devoted to his tropic scheme contravened section  rather there is a dispute about the scope of the parties fiduciary duties and how such duties are implicated by mayers involvement with tropic section h titled conflicts of interest requires disclosure of board member conflicts this section expressly recognizes that rights provided for under this agreement such as the right to make personal proprietary passive investments are not overridden by this section but notwithstanding mayers right to make passive investments mayers cannot credibly contend that he can pursue an investment strategy such as with tropic which aims to harm the companys clients aside from mayers traditional fiduciary duties to the company and its clients no investment fund can be expected to employ someone once the funds clients know that that employee is attempting to undermine their investments the company gave up its involvement with tropic equity once the market got wind of its plan since such a scheme is fatal to investor trust similarly fatal is public knowledge that mayers was doing the same nonetheless though mayers actions may seem untoward the only relevant inquiry is if they constitute grounds for termination with cause under section b which providesthe company may terminate mayers for cause at any time such act shall be taken by the board as used herein cause means any of  mayers fraud or willful or gross misconduct with respect to the business affairs of the company  mayers willful and material breach of any of the covenants and obligations in this agreement including the covenants set forth in article  or  a criminal fraud conviction with respect to clauses  or  of the definition of cause no act or failure to act by mayers shall be considered cause unless the company has given a reasonably detailed written notice thereof to mayers and where remedial action is reasonably feasible mayers has failed to remedy the act or omission within  business days after receiving such notice section c provides that if mayers is terminated for cause he forfeits  of his equityshilowitz who is also a board member voted to terminate mayers for cause however on december   mayers and shilowitz had entered into a contract the shilowitz agreement in which they agreed to not vote for the other to be terminated without cause or removed from the board at the time the shilowitz agreement was executed the company was operating under its third amended and restated llc agreement dated as of march   the  llc agreement the current llc agreement is its fifth iteration which was executed in  the shilowitz agreement which is not set to expire until december   refers to the definition of cause set forth in the  llc agreement shilowitz argues that the shilowitz agreement became a nullity upon the execution of the companys fourth llc agreement and remained a nullity upon the execution of the current llc agreement by virtue of the llc agreements integration clause mayers contends that the shilowitz agreement survives and was violated by shilowitz when he voted to fire mayers though the shilowitz agreement permits shilowitz to vote for mayers termination for cause mayers avers that since as he maintains in this action he was fired without cause shilowitz has breached on february   mayers commenced this action by filing a summons with notice the complaint filed on june   contains nine causes of action  breach of the llc agreement for terminating mayers without cause and failing to provide proper written notice and opportunity to cure against all defendants  breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing against all defendants  breach of the shilowitz agreement  aiding and abetting breach of the llc agreement against all defendants  breach of fiduciary duty against all defendants  aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty against all defendants  conversion of personal items after his termination against the company siegel and shilowitz  bailee liability against the company siegel and shilowitz and  declaratory and injunctive relief motions to dismiss on a motion to dismiss the court must accept as true the facts alleged in the complaint as well as all reasonable inferences that may be gleaned from those facts amaro v gani realty corp  add  st dept  skillgames llc v brody  add   st dept  citing mcgill v parker  add    see also cron v harago fabrics  nyd    the court is not permitted to assess the merits of the complaint or any of its factual allegations but may only determine if assuming the truth of the facts alleged the complaint states the elements of a legally cognizable cause of action skillgames id citing guggenheimer v ginzburg  nyd    deficiencies in the complaint may be remedied by affidavits submitted by the plaintiff amaro  nyd at  however factual allegations that do not state a viable cause of action that consist of bare legal conclusions or that are inherently incredible or clearly contradicted by documentary evidence are not entitled to such consideration skillgames  add at  citing caniglia v chicago tribunenew york news syndicate  add  st dept  further where the defendant seeks to dismiss the complaint based upon documentary evidence the motion will succeed if the documentary evidence utterly refutes plaintiffs factual allegations conclusively establishing a defense as a matter of law goshen v mutual life ins co of ny  nyd    citation omitted leon v martinez  nyd    the charlesbank defendants motion seq  the charlesbank defendants move to dismiss the second breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing fourth aiding and abetting breach of the llc agreement fifth breach of fiduciary duty and sixth aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty causes of action and for partial dismissal of the first breach of the llc agreement cause of action in essence the charlesbank defendants seek to clarify the legal duties they owed mayers with respect to his termination they argue that the llc agreement governs and that mayers may not rely on broader fiduciary or equitable principles delaware law applies under delaware law when interpreting a contract the court must give great weight to the parties objective manifestations of their intent in the written language of their agreement in re ibp inc shareholders lit  ad   del ch  if a contracts meaning is plain and unambiguous it will be given effect id nonetheless in delaware the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing attaches to every contract by operation of law it requires contracting parties to refrain from arbitrary or unreasonable conduct which has the effect of preventing the other party to the contract from receiving the fruits of the bargain otherwise parties to a contract could undermine and frustrate every legal obligation entered into the implied covenant acts as a way to import terms into an agreement to address unanticipated developments or to fill gaps in the contracts provisions to state a claim for breach of the implied covenant a litigant must allege  a specific obligation implied in the contract  a breach of that obligation and  resulting damages met life ins co v tremont group holdings inc  wl  at  del ch  citations and quotation marks omitted emphasis in original see also dunlap v state farm fire  cas co  ad   n  del  collecting cases however the covenant of good faith and fair dealing does not provide a court with the authority to rewrite or supply omitted provisions to a written contract rather a court should be cautious when implying a contractual obligation and do so only where obligations which can be understood from the text of the written agreement have nevertheless been omitted from the agreement in the literal sense in this instance a courts inquiry should focus on what the parties likely would have done if they had considered the issue involved the express terms of a contract and not an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing however will govern the parties relations when the terms expressly address the dispute fitzgerald v cantor  wl  at  del ch  citations and quotation marks omitted emphasis added see also wiggs v summit midstream partners llc  wl  at  del ch  section b of the llc agreement expressly governs whether mayers termination was for cause this bars a good faith claim if mayers takes issue with his former business partners previously engaging in the very scheme he is accused of his recourse as always is a derivative claim on behalf of the company for such wrongs mayers cannot however justify his bad acts by arguing they did it too to be sure mayers has every right to challenge whether his conduct is grounds for termination under the express terms of the llc agreement but mayers cannot evade such terms through a good faith claim mayers also cannot maintain his claim for breach of fiduciary duty under delaware law a fiduciary duty claim arising from a contract must be adjudicated within the analytical framework of a breach of contract claim nemec v shrader  ad   del  any fiduciary claims arising out of the same facts that underlie the contract obligations are foreclosed as superfluous id the only narrow exception to this rule is where the alleged fiduciary duty is owed to the shareholders grayson v imagination station inc  wl  at  del ch  here mayers simply objects to his termination being labeled for causefn since this dispute is expressly governed by the llc agreement the fiduciary duty claim is dismissed as duplicative as a consequence the claim for aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty also is dismissed see globis partners lp v plumtree software inc  wl  at  del ch  as for mayers claim for aiding and abetting breach of contract delaware law only recognizes such a claim where the subject breach relates to a fiduciary duty see gotham partners lp v hallwood realty partners lp  ad   del  feeley v nhaocg llc  ad   del ch  again the parties fiduciary duties are not determinative of mayers claims all that matters is whether mayers dealings with tropic allow for his termination to be deemed as one for cause under section b thus this aiding and abetting claim fails finally with respect to the breach of contract claim the charlesbank defendants ask the court to find the termination letter sufficient and also to dismiss mayers claim for recoupment of the  that he lost when he was forced to sell his tropic equity the letters notice is perfectly clear so clear in fact that mayers knew exactly what to do in response — sell his tropic equity mayers a highly sophisticated individual chose to do so without seeking any legally enforceable guarantee from the company that if he complied he would not be terminated for cause mayers chose to sell without better protecting himself the idea that a businessman of his caliber was forced to do anything is simply unbelievable additionally as the company understandably maintains mayers involvement with tropic was not amenable to remedial action though selling his tropic equity was clearly the right thing to do mayers actions constitute a breach of trust — both as to his partners and the companys investors — that once lost is difficult to regain that being said regardless of how the court might view mayers actions it is the llc agreement itself and to the extent its terms are unclear the parties own intentions that will determine if mayers forfeits half his equity see in re ibp inc shareholders lit supra discovery is needed to deduce if notwithstanding the llc agreements allowance of personal passive investments undermining the companys clients investments for personal gain constitutes willful or gross misconduct with respect to the business affairs of the company shilowitzs motion seq  shilowitz argues that mayers claim for breach of the shilowitz agreement fails for two reasons  the subsequent llc agreements contain integration clauses and  shilowitz did not breach because he voted to fire mayers for cause the shilowitz agreement is governed by new york law under new york law a subsequent contract regarding the same subject matter supersedes the prior contract friedman v ocean dreams llc  misc d a at  sup ct kings county  demarest j quoting indep energy corp v trigen energy corp  fsupp   sdny  see also mandarin oriental mgmt usa inc v ny hotel  motel trades council  wl  at  sdny  collecting cases accord shubin v surchin  add   st dept  when a subsequent agreement contains an integration clause and in some instances even when such a clause is absent the prior agreement becomes a nullity and the new agreement governs see id however when the new agreement does not cover the subject of the parties prior negotiated issues the new agreement does not subsume the prior agreement kramer v danalis  add  st dept  desola group inc v coors brewing co  add  st dept  the ias courts reliance on the standard integration clause in the agreement was misplaced since that clause provides that previous communications concerning only the subject matter of the agreement ie market research are superseded here the shilowitz agreement was not superseded by the subsequent llc agreements though the shilowitz agreement references the  llc agreement it merely does so out of convenience in promising not to fire each other without cause mayers and shilowitz wanted to track the llc agreements definition of causefn there is no plausible basis to infer that the parties intended for the execution of subsequent llc agreements to extinguish their personal pact of loyalty which does not apply to other members of the company in fact it is unclear if the other members even knew about the shilowitz agreement and perhaps their pact was kept out of the llc agreements to keep it a secret regardless as their agreement covers a unique loyalty promise beyond the scope of the llc agreements its unsurprising lack of inclusion in the subsequent llc agreements does not nullify it shilowitz cannot disclaim his agreement with mayers based on a strained gloss on the law of integration that contravenes the parties intentions finally there is no merit to shilowitzs argument that a pretextual forcause termination vote is not a breach if this were the case the parties bargain would be illusory new yorks good faith doctrine forecloses shilowitzs argument see jaffe v paramount communications inc  add   st dept  duty of good faith and fair dealing is breached when a party to a contract acts in a manner that although not expressly forbidden by any contractual provision would deprive the other party of the right to receive the benefits under their agreement see also  w nd owners corp v jennifer realty co  nyd    therefore if it is ultimately determined that mayers was fired without cause mayers would prevail on liability against shilowitz it is unclear however what damages mayers could recover for this breach since if mayers prevails he will keep his equity notably since part ii of the shilowitz agreement states that a violation is an irreparable harm warranting injunctive relief the parties may have contemplated using this contract merely to preemptively prevent termination not recover damages afterward regardless the issue of damages is beyond the scope of this motionfn accordingly it is ordered that the motions to dismiss the complaint by defendants stone castle partners llc joshua s siegel charlesbank equity fund vi limited partnership charlesbank equity coinvestment fund vi limited partnership charlesbank coinvestment partners limited partnership cbsc acquisition inc cibc capital corporation and george shilowitz are granted in part as follows  the second breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing fourth aiding and abetting breach of the llc agreement fifth breach of fiduciary duty and sixth aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty causes of action are dismissed  the first cause of action breach of the llc agreement may proceed in accordance with the decision  all breach of contract claims may only proceed against the parties to those contracts and  the motions are otherwise denied and it is further ordered that within  days of the entry of this order on the nyscef system plaintiff matthew r mayers shall file an amended complaint only containing the claims surviving this motion and clearly identifying which claims apply to which defendants dated february  enter  jsc footnotes footnote  rosenwaks sold his equity in  footnote  see generally loreley financing jersey no  ltd v ubs ltd  misc d  sup ct ny county  footnote  during the financial crisis many equity holders believed that the only return they would ever see would come from the sale of the cdos collateral the court will not opine on the myriad issues surrounding this course of conduct other than to note that managing client money invested in a cdos debt while also having a proprietary investment in the cdos equity can lead to a conflict of interest footnote  mayers cites no authority for the notion that he can maintain a fiduciary duty claim because defendants equity increases due to his share forfeiture this is a foreseeable consequence of forfeiture all that matters is whether the llc agreement permits his termination to be deemed for cause since the llc agreement permits termination for cause at any time defendants motivations are irrelevant though the parties dispute whether defendants had prior knowledge of mayers alleged scheme or if they sanctioned it it strains credulity to think that mayers can continue working for the company after his personal involvement with tropic came to light especially given the companys prior litigation though mayers may feel he got a raw deal such is the risk when playing games with a cdos equity since the debt holders tend to get quite upset regardless if they have a viable claim see eg fin guar ins co v putnam advisory co  wl  sdny sept   footnote  the definition of cause in the  llc agreement is the same as in the current llc agreement footnote  there also appears to be a causation problem because even if shilowtiz did not vote to fire mayers a vote by the majority of the rest of the board would suffice search this case google scholar google books legal blogs google
