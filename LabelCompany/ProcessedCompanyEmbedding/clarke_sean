since  he will work at asda until the end of july and act as an adviser to britain’s thirdbiggest supermarket until the end of the year asda has been the main casualty of the supermarket price war as customers defect to rivals such as the german discounters aldi and lidl walmart said last month that price cuts had failed to stop sales falling for the seventh quarterly period in a row as shoppers opted to shop in rivals’ smaller shops instead of asda’s large stores andy clarke launched a plan called “project renewal” to revive the business in october including cutting prices refurbishing big stores scrapping products and shelving expansion plans asda announced  job cuts in stores and its head office in march and said it would close staff canteens to cut costs asda also opted out of the
