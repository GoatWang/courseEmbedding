circuit judge brorby senior circuit judge and gorsuch circuit judge gorsuch circuit judge david richison filed this lawsuit in  alleging that his former coworkers tricked him into giving up his shares in the small software company where he used to work while it’s not clear whether mr richison’s shares were taken from him rightly or wrongly it is clear they were taken from him long ago in  for this reason the district court held all of mr richison’s claims for relief brought nine years later timebarred under the applicable limitations statutes on appeal mr richison seeks reversal based on a new legal theory he never pressed before the district court this he cannot do at least not without showing plain error a feat he doesn’t even attempt so it is that we must and do affirm in the s david richison was a shareholder director and officer of ernest group inc “egi” but the relationship soured over the years and in january  it unraveled completely that month mr richison signed a memo “resigning from all positions in ernest group” and “forfeiting    ownership of all  shares” roa at  from then on egi no longer treated mr richison as an officer director or shareholder and soon the company reissued mr richison’s shares to other employees for his part mr richison ceased reporting any ownership interest in egi on his tax returns though for a brief time he continued to work at the company in the more limited capacity of a salaried employee this last lingering link however was soon severed when in  mr richison quit working for egi entirely shortly thereafter mr richison contacted the company’s accountant asking that he not be listed as either an officer or shareholder on the corporation’s tax returns for the next several years mr richison and egi had little contact but two events stand out in  egi’s president came to mr richison’s house asking mr richison to reconfirm that he’d relinquished his shares back in  despite his earlier disavowals of share ownership mr richison now refused to cooperate then in  egi’s accountant tried again allegedly telling mr richison that the company was facing an irs audit and that there would be “deep trouble” unless mr richison signed a document confirming the transfer of his shares in  this time mr richison agreed to cooperate and signed the accountant’s document mr richison later discovered there was no irs audit instead he says the accountant’s  phone call was a ploy to enrich egi’s officers and owners by facilitating the sale of a controlling interest in the company to a private equity firm arguing that he had been misled mr richison filed this diversity suit in  alleging conversion civil conspiracy unjust enrichment and breach of fiduciary duty all in violation of oklahoma law in support of all these claims mr richison pursued a singular theory of the facts he alleged that he retained full possession of his shares in egi through  and he alleged that it was only when the company’s accountant approached him in  that he signed a document relinquishing his interest in the shares in reply the defendants moved for summary judgment the undisputed facts they submitted showed that mr richison gave up his egi shares in  not  because mr richison’s claims were based solely on the unlawful taking of his shares the defendants submitted that all his claims accrued nine not two years earlier and this they contended meant that all of mr richison’s claims were timebarred under the relevant oklahoma statutes of limitations the district court agreed with all this and granted summary judgment to the defendants it is this result mr richison now appeals we begin our analysis by looking to oklahoma limitations law oklahoma follows the traditional rule that the statute of limitations generally begins to run when the litigant’s claim accrues that is when he or she can first maintain the claim to a successful conclusion see consolidated grain  barge co v structural systems inc  pd   okla in this case each of mr richison’s tort claims expressly rests on an allegation that he had full possession of egi shares until the defendants took them from him in  see am compl â¶  resp to def’s mot for sum j at  yet as we’ve seen the undisputed facts in this case show that the shares were taken from mr richison back in  it was then that mr richison turned in his resignation “forfeiting ownership of all  shares” then that egi removed him from the corporation’s roster of shareholders and then that the company began treating him as an employee not an owner in its tax filings indeed the undisputed facts show that until filing this suit mr richison hadn’t asserted ownership or exerted dominion and control over the shares for almost a decade it was in  if ever that a claim for the taking of his stock first could have been brought and so accrued for limitations purposes under oklahoma law given that the longest statute of limitations possibly applicable to mr richison’s tort claims is five years see  okla stat §  those claims are timebarred one and all just as the district court held of course mr richison argues that the district court erred in his view there is a live factual dispute for the jury to resolve regarding whether his shares were taken in  rather than  a jury could find that his shares were taken from him in  he says because the document he signed in  relinquishing his interest in them was not legally enforceable all this however misses the point whether the document mr richison signed in  relinquishing his shares was an enforceable contract surely bears on the question whether the defendants were legally authorized to take the shares but to determine when the clock on mr richison’s tort claims began to run we don’t ask when or even whether the defendants lawfully obtained the rights to plaintiff’s property instead what matters is when his tort claims first accrued that is when he first could’ve alleged that the defendants’ conduct was unlawful and whatever we may say about the propriety of the defendants’ conduct the undisputed facts show that any claim involving the wrongful taking of mr richison’s shares accrued in  not in  recognizing the trouble with this theory mr richison seeks to introduce another backup theory on appeal even if the defendants did take his shares in  as they contend mr richison says that their actions in  still tortiously deprived him of a claim to those shares surely he says giving up even a weak claim of interest in the shares even clearing up a mere shadow of a doubt about their status had some value to egi in  especially given that the company was allegedly seeking to polish its records in preparation for a plump stock sale and mr richison contends he had a right to exact a fee for quitting that claim rather than being duped into giving it away for free this is a much more plausible theory one far more consistent with the facts as they emerged at summary judgment but the problem is mr richison never pursued it in the district court in his complaint mr richison alleged only that he retained full possession of the egi shares in  and that the defendants took those shares from him that year at summary judgment the defendants challenged mr richison’s factual account arguing that his claims were timebarred because any such taking occurred in  not  on notice and in the face of this challenge mr richison chose to respond to the defendants’ dispositive motion only by contesting the defendants’ facts steadfastly maintaining that he retained possession of the shares through  at no point did he introduce the alternative legal theory that even if he relinquished the shares in  he was tortiously misled into confirming that fact in  thus we cannot agree with mr richison’s contention that his pleadings before the district court fairly presented this alternative legal theory for the court’s consideration where as here a plaintiff pursues a new legal theory for the first time on appeal that new theory suffers the distinct disadvantage of starting at least a few paces back from the block if the theory was intentionally relinquished or abandoned in the district court we usually deem it waived and refuse to consider it see united states v olano  us    s ct   l ed d   united states v teague  fd   th cir see also singleton v wulff  us    s ct   l ed d   “it is the general rule of course that a federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below” lone star steel v united mine workers of am  fd   th cir “ordinarily a party may not lose in the district court on one theory of the case and then prevail on appeal on a different theory” by contrast if the theory simply wasn’t raised before the district court we usually hold it forfeited see olano  us at   s ct  teague  fd at  “waiver is accomplished by intent but forfeiture comes about through neglect” see united states v zubiatorres  fd   th cir quoting united states v carrascosalazar  fd   th cir unlike waived theories we will entertain forfeited theories on appeal but we will reverse a district court’s judgment on the basis of a forfeited theory only if failing to do so would entrench a plainly erroneous result see zubiatorres  fd at  to show plain error a party must establish the presence of  error  that is plain which  affects substantial rights and which  seriously affects the fairness integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings see id at  naturally a litigant in mr richison’s position would prefer to have us consider a previously unraised theory merely forfeited rather than waived yet instead of attempting to show plain error mr richison says we may forgo plain error review entirely because his new theory is “purely legal” and does not require any additional factfinding in doing so however mr richison overlooks our controlling precedent long ago this court held that we will reverse on the basis of a legal theory not previously presented to the district court when the correct resolution of that theory is beyond a reasonable doubt and the failure to intervene would result in a miscarriage of justice see petrini v howard  fd   n  th cir see also bartlettcollins co v surinam nav co  fd   th cir gomes v williams  fd   th cir  stahmann farms inc v united states  fd   th cir hicks v gates rubber co  fd   th cir united states v  south titan court  fd   th cir all using similar formulations more recently we have stated this standard in slightly different terms requiring a litigant to show the four elements of plain error see emp’rs reinsurance corp v midcontinent cas co  fd   th cir applying plain error to forfeited legal arguments ecclesiastes  inc v lmc holding co  fd   th cir same linguistic packaging aside the substantive analysis under either articulation of the standard is similar see titan court  fd at  and the litigant’s burden is the same establishing a clear legal error that implicates a miscarriage of justice thus our longstanding practice has been to review newly raised but not waived legal arguments under what substantively amounts to and what we have more recently described as the plain error standard and we confirm this rule again today to be sure as we’ve noted previously this court’s cases haven’t always been so precise in distinguishing between waiver and forfeiture see zubiatorres  fd at   n  neither as it turns out have they always been so precise about applying the plain errormanifest injustice standard to newly raised legal theories see eg proctor  gamble co v haugen  fd   th cir  geddes v united staffing alliance emp med plan  fd   th cir united states v jarvis  fd    n  th cir all reversing based on new legal theories without explicitly finding plain error or manifest injustice but despite this imprecision no case in this circuit has held that we may reverse based on “purely legal” arguments in the absence of plain error and the fact that this court has sometimes reversed on the basis of a new legal argument without indicating the burden the appellant must carry to obtain reversal cannot ensconce binding precedent requiring or allowing us to ignore the longstanding requirement that new legal arguments overcome plain error see cooper indus inc v aviall svcs inc  us    s ct   l ed d   noting that “questions which merely lurk in the record of earlier cases neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon are not to be considered as having been so decided as to constitute precedents” what’s more even if the silence of haugen geddes and jarvis could be understood as a deliberate relaxing of the miscarriage of justiceplain error requirement our older and so controlling cases petrini bartlettcollins stahmann hicks and titan court all discuss appellate intervention only in the presence of legal error and manifest injustice as the plain error standard requires so it is that our precedent does nothing to preclude and instead does a great deal more to affirm our conclusion that plain error review should pertain in these circumstances other considerations support this result allowing mr richison to receive unconditional review of his newly minted legal theory would risk affording more forgiving appellate procedures to civil litigants like mr richison than to similarly situated criminal defendants by rule criminal defendants may seek review of unwaived arguments “not brought to the district court’s attention” only under the plain error standard see fedrcrimp b it would be highly anomalous we think to afford civil appellants like mr richison a more forgiving standard than we provide criminal defendants especially as the supreme court has cautioned us repeatedly against creating unwarranted exceptions to plain error review in the criminal context see johnson v united states  us    s ct   l ed d   puckett v united states  us   s ct    l ed d   overruling united states v peterson  fd  th cir neither would the result mr richison seeks sit easily with the larger structure of our adversarial and appellate systems our adversarial system endows the parties with the opportunity and duty to craft their own legal theories for relief in the district court it is the significant but limited job of our appellate system to correct errors made by the district court in assessing the legal theories presented to it not to serve as “a secondshot forum    where secondary backup theories may be mounted for the first time” telecommunications inc v cir  fd   th cir internal quotation marks omitted affording plenary appellate review to newly raised legal theories would do much to undermine this adversarial and appellate order it would force the judicial system to permit costly “doovers” in the district court anytime a party can conceive a new winning argument on appeal even when the district court answered perfectly every question of law the parties bothered to put before it it would also work unfairness on appellees who no doubt thought they knew the legal questions at issue in the case by the time of appeal only to be surprised when a new threat to their victory in the district court emerges from nowhere for the first time in the pages of an appellate brief under our plain error rule parties have the opportunity not only to present whatever theory they desire in the district court but also to explain why their substantial rights and the integrity of our judicial system justify undoing the work of that district court on the force of an argument they didn’t present the first time around it would be wasteful and an invitation for potential abuse to permit a second trip to the district court on the basis of any lesser showing this reluctance to command doovers in the district court is also why we treat arguments for affirming the district court differently than arguments for reversing it we have long said that we may affirm on any basis supported by the record even if it requires ruling on arguments not reached by the district court or even presented to us on appeal see united states v davis  fd   th cir griess v state of colo  fd   th cir see also sec v chenery corp  us    s ct   l ed   “in reviewing the decision of a lower court it must be affirmed if the result is correct although the lower court relied upon a wrong ground or gave a wrong reason” internal quotation omitted this preference for affirmance no doubt follows from the deference we owe to the district courts and the judgments they reach many times only after years of involved and expensive proceedings because of the cost and risk involved anytime we upset a court’s reasoned judgment we are ready to affirm whenever the record allows it so it is that appellants must always shoulder a heavy burden they must come ready both to show the district court’s error and when necessary to explain why no other grounds can support affirmance of the district court’s decision and this burden is rightfully all the higher when the argument for reversal wasn’t even presented to the lower court for all these reasons we reject mr richison’s invitation to overlook the fact that he forfeited his alternative claim to relief if a newly raised legal theory is entitled to appellate review at all if it wasn’t waived before the district court it may form a basis for reversal only if the appellant can satisfy the elements of the plain error standard of review in civil cases this often proves to be an “extraordinary nearly insurmountable burden” see emp’rs reinsurance corp  fd at  before us however mr richison hasn’t even attempted to show how his new legal theory satisfies the plain error standard and the failure to do so the failure to argue for plain error and its application on appeal surely marks the end of the road for an argument for reversal not first presented to the district court see mckissick v yuen  fd   th cir noting that “even if a party’s arguments were merely forfeited before the district court the failure to explain    how they survive the plain error standard waives the arguments in this court” that said we appreciate that mr richison’s decision not to raise his alternative theory of relief before the district court could have been the product of a wellreasoned and even shrewd decision it very well may be that he or his counsel judged the lawsuit worthwhile only if they could recoup the full value of the shares not some comparatively small expected settlement value associated with mr richison’s decision in  to confirm his earlier relinquishment of the shares likewise mr richison or his counsel may have thought an alternative valueoftheclaim theory would be distracting from or detrimental to the argument that mr richison was a shareholder in  and decided it wasn’t worth the risk but however reasonable mr richison’s decision was not to pursue a different legal theory before the district court we are equally certain that mr richison may not now revisit that decision on appeal without at least satisfying the plain error standard of review affirmed notes  neither does the discovery rule salvage mr richison’s claims the discovery rule of course tolls the statute of limitations until a plaintiff acquires “sufficient information which if pursued would lead to the true condition of things” daugherty v farmers coop ass’n  pd   okla  in this case however the undisputed facts show that mr richison had ample reason to know since the early ’s that the defendants had taken his shares after all mr richison himself expressly disclaimed his interest in the shares in  and in july of  contacted egi’s accountant to ask that he not be listed as either an officer or shareholder on the corporation’s tax returns in his own tax returns mr richison likewise ceased reporting an ownership interest in egi that year and hasn’t reported one since even if we could somehow overlook all this evidence regarding mr richison’s knowledge in  and  there remains the fact that the president of egi visited mr richison in  and asked him for written confirmation of the  transfer at that point any reasonable person would have had sufficient information as a matter of law to know that others were asserting ownership of and dominion over the shares  although the supreme court has advised us that there are “circumstances in which a federal appellate court is justified in resolving an issue not passed on below” the court has consistently left the job of defining the bounds of such circumstances to the courts of appeals singleton  us at   s ct  see also exxon shipping co v baker  us    s ct   l ed d    jarvis illustrates how we have on occasion come to reverse based on a forfeited argument without addressing the standard for doing so in that case we evaluated only whether the legal nature of the newly presented argument allowed us to consider it that is whether it could be advanced on appeal at all see jarvis  fd at  n  that question of course now has a simple and wellsettled answer we are free to consider any new argument legal or otherwise provided it was not waived in the district court see zubiatorres  fd at  jarvis didn’t however address the burden that must be carried by such a forfeited argument to justify reversal as evidenced by the fact it didn’t discuss or apply the plain errormiscarriage of justice rule already established by petrini stahmann farms and titan court so when it comes to the question raised by mr richison whether an appellant needs to show plain error to win reversal on a new legal theory jarvis
