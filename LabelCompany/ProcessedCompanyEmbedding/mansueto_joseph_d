video chicago magazine share this story edit module x edit module edit module edit module the quiet billionaire morningstar ceo joe mansueto after an idyllic midwestern upbringing joe mansueto founded an enormously successful financial information company on the simple premise that people might like an easytouse guide to mutual funds now the morningstar ceo is turning his skills to the risky world of magazine publishing can he succeed again by john cook published june   if you happened to be driving down hohman avenue in hammond indiana in december of  you may have seen a handlettered sign reading “fine pines and awesome balsams” designed to advertise the services of a small christmastree business that had sprung up in the neighborhood just that month it was a modest affair as seasonal christmas tree lots go a rented parking lot filled with the aforementioned pines and balsams snow fences to keep out thieves and rented lamps to light the way after dark for families wandering through the merchandise looking for that perfect tree it was quite ordinary in all respects but for the proprietor joe mansueto the softspoken contemplative yearold doctor’s son who had rented the lot lights and snow fence and hauled all the trees to hammond from the randolph street market in chicago was not your average tree hawker for starters he was on his way to earning his master’s degree in business administration from the university of chicago graduate school of businessan institution that seeks to prepare its charges for the executive ranks not sapstained grunt work but as mansueto counted out the change for those eightfoot pines his young mind was already nursing the seeds of an idea that would turn him into a billionaire and it had nothing to do with trees related content mansueto q  a “i guess i broke even” mansueto says today sitting in a glasswalled conference room in the loop headquarters of morningstar the financial information firm he founded  years ago “i realized that the key thing is how you manage your inventory if you’re left with too many trees at the end that can kill you i think if i had done it another year it would have been a moneymaker” mansueto knows something about making money morningstar which he founded in his lincoln park living room has become one of the most recognizable brands in the business of investment advice its star ratings for mutual funds have made it the roger ebert of the investing worlda universally recognized and trusted adviser that reduces the intimidating complexity of mutual funds into simple ataglance evaluations if you have a retirement account or invest in mutual funds there’s a good chance that you’ve used morningstar’s services even if you didn’t know itmansueto has found a way to sell his data and analysis to just about everyone who handles or writes about money from yahoo to big brokerages like j p morgan chase to smallscale financial advisers in may  mansueto took morningstar public and his percent ownership stake in the company he meticulously guided for more than two decades became worth more than  million overnight since then the stock has soared  percent catapulting mansueto last year onto forbes magazine’s list of the  wealthiest people in america his  million shares are currently worth  billion this past april mansueto revealed plans to sell up to  million of those shares which at recent prices would fetch more than  million it didn’t take long for mansueto to find some new toys to buy with all that money last june just one month after the ipo he surprised many by buying two struggling financial magazines inc and fast company from gruner  jahr a division of the german publishing conglomerate bertelsmann for  million a few months before that time out chicagoan attempt by the owners of time out london and time out new york to extend the successful youthoriented weekly city guide to chicagowas launched with a percent investment from mansueto a few years prior to that mansueto lost out in an attempt to buy the very magazine you now hold in your hands when primedia sold it in  though mansueto says he entered the high bid of  million primedia decided instead to sell it to tribune company for  million clearly joe mansueto has a magazine jones and he wouldn’t be the first to make obscene amounts of money in the business world and use it to buy himself cachet in the form of a shiny new magazine or newspaperphilip anschutz the billionaire founder of qwest communications is launching a chain of commuter newspapers aimed at young readers bruce wasserstein the new york investment banker bought new york magazine two years ago for  million and the realestate mogul mort zuckerman has his new york daily news and us news and world report but if mansueto is indeed making a play to join the press baronshe is coy about whether or not more purchases are in the offinghe lacks one crucial attribute common to the egomassaging billionaire who buys himself a soapbox an ego “i’ve met a lot of billionaires” says john koten the editor in chief of inc and fast company and the ceo of mansueto ventures “and joe is different the important thing about joe is that he’s very substantial not showy i think of him as a real midwestern billionaire whenever he says something people know that even if it’s not loud or histrionic they need to listen to what he’s saying there’s a tremendous amount of strength there it’s almost zen” mansueto may be a billionaire but at morningstar he’s cubicle bound like the rest of us he’s never had an office and prefers being open and accessible to his employees over being “cramped” behind closed doors there’s a fairly good chance that no other billionaire has spent six weeks as mansueto once did working as a night manager at arby’snot because he needed the job but because he was considering opening a restaurant and was curious about the business for someone who has devoted his life to helping other people accumulate wealth he is remarkably uninterested in its trappings according to his friends the closest thing to an extravagance in mansueto’s life is the sevenyearold bmw he drives approximate blue book value  which is notable mostly because of the significant step up it represents from the used mitsubishi montero with rust holes in the floor panel that he continued to drive well after he earned his first million “he is splurging when if he sees a sweater at the gap he likes he buys it in several colors” says his longtime friend and former business partner kurt hanson indeed mansueto showed up for an interview wearing what looked suspiciously like a gap charcoal turtleneck sweater and blue jeans “i think joe is genuinely selfeffacing” hanson says “it’s not that fake selfeffacing that politicians do he has no psychic need for a squarefoot corner office with a mahogany desk” no one who has ever met joe mansueto would peg him for a christmas tree salesman he is quiet unassuming and intensely thoughtful with a medium frame and welltended hands that don’t advertise an aptitude for hard physical labor he is a ringer for the actor michael moriarty who played an assistant district attorney on law  order he shares moriarty’s purposeful gaze and open face and yet anybody who has met mansueto also knows that selling christmas trees for a month just to see how it’s donejust because he was curiousis precisely the sort of thing he would do he seems blithely unaware of the status barriers that make it unlikely for a recent mba grad to be managing the night shift at arby’s and he has a penchant for following his curiosity wherever it leads him in the late s when morningstar began to establish a web presence he decided he’d better learn about the online world so he set up a charmingly primitive web site he used to keep friends and family up to date on the progress of the birth of his first child jenna he did the entire project himself from registering the domain name to writing the software code that allowed users to post messages on the site “i always enjoyed just kind of seeing how business works” he says “at the end of the day you have more money in your pocket than at the beginning of the day it’s kind of interesting how that works” mansueto got his first sense of how it works when he was in the sixth grade born in  he grew up in calumet city illinois near the indiana border in a neighborhood he describes as a classic suburban idyllriding his bike around the neighborhood football in the street trips into the city on the weekends for lunch at the walnut room his parents met at a hospital his father mario was an ear nose and throat specialist his mother sara was a nurse who left the profession to stay home with joe his brothers john and daniel and his sister connie as a child mansueto was a ham radio enthusiast his first successful act of entrepreneurialism was when at a ham festival he saw a receiver on sale at a steep discount “i knew it was worth say ” he says “and this guy was selling it for  i remember borrowing  from the guy’s father who took me and i went and sold it for about  and you know as a sixth grader to make  in a month i was in heaven i thought gee this is easy how you can buy something and sell it for morei was just kind of amazed how that works” mansueto carried that geewhiz fascination with making money to the university of chicago where he went as an undergraduate and stayed on to earn an mba to hear him tell it mansueto’s time there was like a scene out of real genius the  geeksgonewild val kilmer vehicle but with doityourself business ventures instead of kilmer’s elaborate gonzo physics experiments he and his roommate hanson launched the room  soda service out of their dorm room in the shoreland “i think we did it more for the entrepreneurial fun than for the money” says hanson “we found you could call the coke distributor and he’d roll up ten cases of coke to your room” students would stop by  hours a day for soda and chips and mansueto and hanson each pulled in about  in profit per quarter the same ethic informed mansueto’s christmas tree venture a few years later “here’s a guy with an mba from one of the best business schools in the country standing in the middle of all these trees” recalls jeff jarmuth another college friend who now advises hedge funds “and he was always really good at investing even back then so money wasn’t an issue but he was as happy as a clam because he was running the show” after graduating mansueto and hanson went into business together launching strategic media research a consulting firm that did market research for radio stations hanson had interned at a few stations during college they set up shop in northbrookbecause hanson says the suburb’s name looked classy on the business cardsand conducted phone surveys designed to tease out the demographic characteristics and consumer habits of people who liked groups such as the eagles after about a year mansueto realized he didn’t want to be in radio and he decided to strike out on his own shortly after business school mansueto read the money masters by john train a collection of profiles of successful investors one of them was the oracle of omaha warren buffett for mansueto it was a transformative experience he had long been fascinated by investing and his friends say that studying companies was his only real discernible hobby “he’d write away for annual reports” says jarmuth who lived with mansueto after they graduated “the mailman would come and he’d be cussing because he had  pounds of annual reports” reading about buffett’s nononsense nofrills longview approach to investing ignited something in mansueto and he sent away for the latest annual report from buffett’s company berkshire hathaway “it was an epiphany” mansueto says buffett’s direct unadorned letter to his investors was a welcome departure from the typical annual report which tended to be little more than a thicket of prdriven bromides designed to prop up the stock price in discovering buffett mansueto found a model for the kind of businessman he wanted to become methodical ethical and transparent around the same time mansueto began investing in mutual funds in the early s prior to the widespread introduction of individual retirement accounts and the emergence of the middleclass individual investor mutual funds were a relatively small phenomenon and there was no single source of information on themperformance holdings and the like the only way to get that information was to order each fund’s prospectus individually which mansueto did one night in his onebedroom apartment at clark street and wrightwood avenue as he looked through all those prospectuses spread out across his dining room table the idea hit him “i thought boy wouldn’t it be really interesting if somebody compiled all these things into a compendium so i wouldn’t have to make these calls every three months” mansueto says “gee maybe this could be a business you could publish a book on mutual funds with comprehensive information with the goal of helping investors make better decisions about the funds they were buying” and so morningstar was born but methodical as ever mansueto waited a few years before actually diving in first he did that stint at arby’s to see if he wouldn’t rather pursue a chain of fastfood health food stores he would not and then he spent two years working for a venture capital firm and later as a stock analyst just to make sure the mutual funds idea held up over time it did so in april of  he launched morningstar his timing was astonishing when mansueto started morningstarfirst as a quarterly book with a onepage summary of financial data for every fund available before branching out into newsletters and commercial databases of fund informationthere were  mutual funds with  billion in assets today there are more than  funds with more than  trillion in assets throughout that period of massive growth morningstar was virtually the only game in town for getting information on mutual funds and it continues to be so “they’ve had an immense impact” says jane bryant quinn newsweek’s personal finance columnist “before morningstar people had absolutely no ideayou can’t really tell anything from the fund’s prospectus now everybody wants to buy a fivestar fund all the ads for funds trumpet their four or fivestar ratings it’s given people the sense that they can get independent evaluations of mutual funds which they never had before before morningstar what did they have to go on but what the salesman told them” today morningstar employs  analysts to cover  funds and  stocks it has recently launched a database of hedge fundsa notoriously murky corner of the financial worldand taken a huge step into asset management with the million purchase of ibbotson associates a chicago firm that manages more than  million in retirement accounts morningstar has offices in  countries including china england and australia last year it pulled in revenues of more than  million but despite mansueto’s initial commitment to helping individual investors by shining a light on the mutual fund world less than a third of that money came from morningstar’s individual investor services which consist largely of its web site the vast majority of its revenue millionnow comes from licensing its data and ratings to financial advisers and institutional clients such as charles schwab merrill lynch fidelity investments goldman sachs and j p morgan chase that arrangementmorningstar makes money off some of the same firms that it is supposed to be dispassionately evaluatinghas raised eyebrows and in december  the company announced that new york attorney general eliot spitzer had opened an investigation into morningstar associates its consulting arm morningstar associates sells its services to k plans designing menus of funds that should be attractive to a given company’s employees spitzer has not specified what he is looking into but published reports have speculated that his office is investigating the possibility that morningstar may be paid to recommend certain fundsa charge the company firmly denies a separate securities and exchange commission investigation into an error morningstar made in reporting a fund’s value was closed in february without action the conflictofinterest accusations are particularly troubling because they cut to the heart of morningstar’s brand identityproviding independent uncorrupted investment advice without fear or favor so to speak when scandal gripped wall street in  after spitzer launched investigations into  investment banks for offering biased research in an attempt to drum up banking business morningstar’s analysts were some of the earliest and most outspoken critics of the shenanigans and morningstar eventually stepped in to help remedy the situationand make some moneyby agreeing as part of the banks’ settlement with spitzer to provide independent analysis for five banks to pass on to clients ironically most of those banks offer mutual funds that morningstar also rates “it would certainly be nice if those investigations wrap up soon” says marvin loh the managing director of d e investment research which covers morningstar adding that the purchase of ibbotson has increased worries about conflicts of interest “some people have raised concerns that it would possibly conflict with their other business lines they’re rating mutual funds and they purchase mutual funds” on behalf of clients whose assets they manage mansueto says that there are rigid rules at morningstar designed to ward off conflicts of interest one is that the people responsible for selling the data are not allowed to talk to analysts period but he is characteristically philosophical about the criticism “i think it’s very fair” he says “i think it’s only natural to evaluate the evaluator we’ve tried to be very open and transparent in how we run the business and let people make their own judgments about who we are what we do and how we do it for the regulators to be looking at this it’s perfectly fine these are legitimate things to inquire about” when spitzer launched the investigation mansueto’s friends jarmuth and hanson tried to argue that it was political grandstanding on spitzer’s parthe had just declared his candidacy for governor of new york “we couldn’t get joe to agree to that” hanson says “one good lesson joe took away from buffett in starting morningstar was developing a thesis on what is a good businessand publishing is a good business” hanson says because you incur costs just once to gather the information and sell it over and over again not to mention he adds with a wry laugh “serve a community with lots of moneyinvestorsand it shouldn’t be too hard to get money out of them but publishing financial evaluations is different from publishing magazines and the question for mansueto is precisely how hard it will be for inc fast company and to a lesser extent time out chicagohe’s on the hook for only half of that ventureto get money out of an advertising community that is eyeing print media warily as readership drops and online competition surges though magazine ad revenues were up last year a total of  percent across the board to  billion according to the magazine publishers of america the total number of us magazine ad pages sold in  had crept up by just over half a percentage point over the preceding year and even as the industry as a whole slowly shakes off the post– ad slumpa revival driven in large part by the success of celebrity titles like us weeklythe business category has been anemic at best total ad revenues for business titles last year were  billion up from  billion in  that’s an average annual growth rate of just  percentthe sort of returns that a morningstar analyst would scoff at few publications more clearly embody the tumble that print magazines have taken since the roaring nineties than fast company when the realestate tycoon mort zuckerman sold it to gruner  jahr in  for a whopping  million fast company was pulling in more than  million a year in revenue and was fat with  ad pagesmore than vanity fair last year it took in less than half that millionwith a mere  ad pages much of fast company’s decline can be attributed to the fact that the silicon valley culture it chronicled with cover lines like “how to webify yourself” simply doesn’t exist anymorelive by the bubble die by the bubble and its close identification with the irrational exuberance of the internet boom is the biggest obstacle it faces in reestablishing a loyal readership to a business community that still smarts from boondoggles like petscom the term “fast company” doesn’t mean what it once did inc a staid yearold monthly with a longstanding audience of entrepreneurs and smallbusiness owners is on better footing but its numbers are only slightly less disconcerting than fast company’sad pages were down  percent last year and revenue was down  percent six years ago inc took in  million in revenue last year it pulled down just more than half that together fast company and inc lost  million last year mansueto says he hopes to cut that loss in half this year which essentially means he paid  million for the privilege of losing another  million this year nor is time out chicago which was launched a year ago a sure bet though time out has met success in london and new york it remains to be seen whether the magazine’s snappy urban approach to weekend living will sell in chicago already mansueto says it has hit distribution snags after learning that the distributor had been leaving boxes of the magazines unopened in stores rather than making sure they were quickly put on displaywhich meant death for a weeklytime out had to hire its own people to go store to store and make sure the magazines got on racks “it’s not making money” mansueto says “nor do we plan for it to make money for several years that’s just how it is in the magazine business but there’s some real momentum behind it in terms of the circulation in terms of the advertising support” mansueto declined to offer specific figures aside from pegging the circulation at “about ” time out chicago’s publisher steve timble did not respond to repeated voice mail messages all of which raises the question if joe mansueto is so smart what’s he doing investing in business magazines “he’s in good company” says koten the ceo of mansueto ventures “si newhouse and rupert murdoch are planning to make big investments in business news” koten is referring to condé nast’s plans to launch a new business title in  and news corp’s planned businessnews cable channel “these are not properties that stand a chance of going backwards” he says acknowledging that the magazines under his care having been bled dry and neglected by gruner  jahr have essentially hit rock bottom “but the brands have a value beyond print” inc’s conference business for instance was once a major part of its operation koten says and he’s working to beef it up once again for mansueto picking up fast company and inc for less than  percent of what gruner  jahr paid for them in  isn’t much different from buying a ham radio receiver that’s on sale for a third of what it’s worth only this time he didn’t have to borrow money from a friend’s dad to seal the deal “buy low sell high” koten says “his view is that gruner  jahr bought at the absolute peak and hung on until they hit bottom” “true the magazine business is a bit in the doldrums today” mansueto says “but in my view it’s more cyclical than secular it’s not a longterm decline for the magazine business if you’ve got a strong franchise the magazine business is not the newspaper business google and craig’s list are a real threat to classified advertising but a monthly magazinei think it’s pretty hard to recreate that experience on the web if you look at time warner their magazine business does i don’t know  billion in sales a billion in profit i mean that’s not chump change” but for all mansueto’s coldeyed analytical justifications there is an emotional explanation for his new hobby you don’t try and fail to buy a city magazine and then say yes when an expanding local entertainment magazine franchise comes calling and then put in a bid for two business magazines all in the course of three years just because you think they’re all good investments that happened to come over the transom he likes magazines and he wanted to own some “they’re very creative interesting businesses” he says “i love to read i’m a magazine junkie and so there’s something about the great journalism combined with compelling graphics nice paper stockthat whole package i find very attractive if it’s done right” in fact mansueto says koten would like him to own morehe has raised the prospect of buying more titles “the magazines are fun interesting things” mansueto says “might something pop up it may but i’ve told them ‘let’s get these magazines working first before we broach the subject of buying more’” mansueto put about  of his own money into morningstar during its first five years of operation just under half of that came from savings bonds that his father had bought for him as a child mansueto is still very close with his parentshe drives to their home in munster indiana most weekends for dinnerand he becomes emotional talking about his father’s efforts to make sure he had a nest egg to start out with “i had these savings bonds that my dad gave me when i graduated” he says “you know it’s kind of touching when you see them because they all have dates on them i was born in september  so there’s one dated september  for  and then there’d be one from october  and so every month my dad is going to the bank and buying me savings bonds since i was born i felt that that’s money that i didn’t want to lose” family looms large in mansueto’s life in  he married rika yoshida a morningstar analyst today they have three children and live in a lincoln park condominium mansueto keeps strict work hours  am to  or  pm with an occasional saturday at the office so he can spend as much time with them as possible aside from his beloved early morning jogs along lake michigan and reading the occasional annual report he has no other interests or hobbies to take him away from thema fact of which he seems almost proud four years ago his younger brother john a financial adviser who lived in the chicago area came down with what seemed like a bad flu “i remember i had lunch with him” mansueto says “he was saying ‘i’m feeling bad i think i’m just going to go home and sleep’ and then a week later he’s in the hospital and a couple days later he’s on a respirator” john was diagnosed with west nile virusthere was an outbreak in chicago that year “he had a very severe form of it” mansueto says “where basically it was like polio you lose the capacity to move your muscles” after a ninemonth hospital stay john was released in the spring of  he was still weak wheelchair bound and in need of physical therapy because he had trouble breathing his lungs had a tendency to fill up with fluid which had to be drained at the hospital on friday may   while john was on the way home from physical therapy his lungs filled up too quickly and he drowned mansueto has difficulty talking about it “i feel like i’ve led a golden life” he says “with the exception of losing my brother compared to that i’ve never had any bad thing happen to me i still wake up in the middle of the night and think about it we were very close” in  if all goes according to plan morningstar will move from its current location on west wacker drive into a new office tower at the longneglected block  site at state and randolph streets in chicago’s loop it’s worth noting that nothing has ever gone according to plan when it comes to the longvacant lot downtown at press time construction had been halted owing to the financial woes of the construction company contracted to build the development mansueto and his team will share the building with cbs and wbbm–channel  mansueto hopes to build a huge financial information display at ground level on washington street possibly a giant stock ticker that will roll out morningstar financial data throughout the day on top of the tower he has secured the rights to add the morningstar logo to the city’s skyline a prospect that one might expect would be a big deal for himthe name of the company he started nearly a quarter century ago from his living room will become a part of chicago’s landscapebut he demurs “it’s nice it’s not the sears tower it’s taller than marshall field’s but it’s not as tall as many of the skyscrapers in chicago” the name that will soon loom above the downtown streetscape comes from henry david thoreau’s on walden pond “it was one of the first books i read when i was at the university of chicago” mansueto says “i can still remember sitting in regenstein library sitting in one of those very comfortable chairs finishing that book wondering gee how is thoreau going to end this book and i get to that last line ‘the sun is but a morning star’ and i pause and look out over the quad and the snow is coming down and i think to myself what the hell does that mean” he has since figured it out “it’s an optimistic statement something that’s been around as long as the sun is still in its infancy it’s still a morning star there’s a rebirth that’s just beginning thoreau to me is about independence selfreliance thrift that’s what walden’s all about” it’s vintage mansueto the thinking man’s capitalist he named the company that would make him a billionaireand ostensibly help make countless investors who use morningstar’s data wealthier than they otherwise would beafter the work of a transcendentalist tax dodger is he aware that thoreau was not exactly a fan of the accumulation of wealth “well ok it’s not a perfect analogy” he says “that’s why it’s not the thoreau company”   share edit module advertisement other politics
