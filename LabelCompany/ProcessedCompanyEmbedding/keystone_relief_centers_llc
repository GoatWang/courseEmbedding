the pennsylvania department of health on thursday announced the names of  companies that will be permitted to sell medical marijuana across the state next year reaching another milestone in a program that could lead to cannabis being available by  the announcement also set off another round of consternation about whether the cannabis dispensaries were being distributed fairly and put in places where they would serve the most patients in suburban philadelphia six are to open in montgomery county three in bucks county and two each in chester and delaware counties in philadelphia the state approved four locations three across the northernmost tier of the city with one in east mount airy and two in northeast philadelphia the fourth is in fishtown near the sugarhouse casino “there’s not one in center city not one in west philadelphia not one by the airport or in old city” said andrew b sacks a lawyer and chairman of the medical marijuana and hemp department at sacks weston diamond llc “there should have been one on walnut street period this is just asinine” each of the  winners has the right to operate three storefronts though  dispensaries are allowed by law many applicants chose not to ask for additional outlets just  are expected to open sometime next year “it’s hard to see if there was much consideration for access by patients given these locations” said alva mather one of three partners at the pepper hamilton llp law firm leading a new cannabis industry group “being able to get to healthcare facilities is always an issue it’s not set up with that framework in mind” “a lot of these patients are terminal” said chris goldstein a marijuana and patient advocate who writes the philly column for phillycom “dispensaries should be as convenient as a cvs or a rite aid” but that could change the winners who have not committed themselves to opening all three of their allotted dispensaries “have the ability to put in for their second or third locations after their first is up and running” said april hutcheson a spokeswoman for the state health department hutcheson said the locations were businesses that scored the highest on their applications “this is only the start of the program and we’re moving quickly to getting medication to the public” hutcheson said “as we need to grow we can they still have the ability to open up more locations” the city zoning office is ready to expand the number of sites it has cleared the way for  dispensary locations granting zoning permits for real estate in neighborhoods that include northern liberties old city and center city there is a variance for th and walnut streets it is up to a permit winner to arrange with the building owner to open at one of those sites all applicants were required to pay  to apply for a dispensary permit the companies also had to post a  deposit — refundable only to failed bidders — for each storefront each of the winners’ three shops is required to be in a different county dispensaries will operate like pharmacies that sell only one product medicinal cannabis oils which can be vaporized or consumed in a solution they will be forbidden to sell wholeplant flower or edible products each permit according to industry experts is worth  million to  million depending on the location and the number of customers each serves the dispensaries will be the only point where patients will encounter medical marijuana to get it they will be required to see a doctor who is certified and registered with the state department of health the doctor will write a letter stating that the patient suffers from one or more of  qualifying conditions it is up to the patient to submit the letter to the state and receive an id card only card holders will be allowed to enter and they will be able to buy medical cannabis from any dispensary in the state in southeastern pennsylvania dispensaries are slated for abington bensalem bristol devon elkins park fort washington king of
