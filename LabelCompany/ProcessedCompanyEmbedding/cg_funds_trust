mutual fund private fund  provident fund other instruments content   mutual fund   mutual fund is an investment product in the form of collective investment scheme into which funds of investors are pooled and managed by an asset management company which is licensed by the sec to undertake investment management business a mutual fund is a juristic person separate from the responsible asset management company        as the investing public’s interest is at stake establishment and management of mutual funds are subject to the sec regulations to ensure that they are managed appropriately by professionals in accordance with the objectives of the fund schemes   the sec’s criteria for approving a mutual fund includes clarity and regulatory compliance of the investment policy disclosure of risks and returns disclosure of redemption rights including the right to dividends if any the right to transfer investment units and the right to cast a vote on proposed change to the scheme etc      after an approval for establishing a mutual fund is granted the initial public offering cannot commence until the asset management company appoints an independent thirdparty as fund supervisor to guard the assets of the fund and ensure that the investment complies with the fund scheme   upon completion of the initial public offering the proceeds must be registered as a mutual fund thus becoming a juristic person separate from the asset management company in the possible event of bankruptcy of the asset management company the asset segregation will prevent the creditors’ claim for right in the fund’s assets any retail fund must have at least  unitholders   in managing a mutual fund the asset management company must comply with the governing rules and the investment policy specified in the prospectus the investment policy must be risk diverse in terms of asset industrial sector and company and in line with investment restrictions if any   a fund manager is assigned by the asset management company to make investment decisions in line with the investment objectives and policy specified in the scheme prior to performing such role the fund manager must obtain an approval from the sec whose criteria include levels of relevant knowledge and work experience professional codes of conduct and possession of prohibited characteristics   in addition a fund supervisor must be appointed to perform fiduciary duties and act for the best interest of the unitholders this includes ensuring that the investment is in accordance with the fund scheme reviewing the calculation of the net asset value nav safekeeping and registration of fund assets taking a legal action against the asset management company’s misconduct on behalf of the unitholders and appointing an secapproved auditor to audit the financial statements of the fund   the asset management company must regularly calculate and disclose the nav based on the market price as well as prepare the halfyear and annual financial statements in compliance with the accounting standards and disclose them completely for investors to make investment decisions  mutual fund with specific purposes    property fund is a retail fund established for the specific purpose of seeking benefits from freehold or leasehold of a property it gives the investing public an alternative access to property investment and an opportunity to earn stable income mainly from leasehold a property fund is prohibited to seek any benefit other than rental fees and its investment units must be distributed to the investing public fairly and thoroughly      infrastructure fund is a vehicle for raising capital for an infrastructure project developed by a public or private developer this helps to curb budgetary burdens and public debts as well as offer a financing alternative for business sectors an infrastructure fund gains returns from the infrastructure project in which it invests and pays dividends to

constraints on foreign shareholding limit on the stock exchange of thailand set   thai trust fund is not subject to strict supervision as it is not offered to the general public and established for specific purposes       content  private fund  provident fund     private fund is a pooled fund collected from no more than  investors managed by a licensed asset management company and investing in securities or other assets according to the agreement made with the investors unlike mutual fund private fund is not a juristic person and therefore to protect investors’ interest the sec regulations require that the responsible asset management company appoint an secapproved private fund manager and that the private fund’s assets be segregated from the management company’s proprietary portfolio to prevent seeking of improper benefits from the private fund’s assets the asset management company must appoint an secapproved custodian to safeguard the private fund’s assets the custodian too must separate the private fund’s assets from its own proprietary portfolio    provident fund is a fund set up voluntarily between an employer and its employees as an incentive for the latter to earn additional savings for retirement or resignation the pooled fund consists of money contributed by both parties initially provident funds were supervised by the ministry of finance and later came under the sec supervision of asset management business on march      regulations on provident funds are generally in line with those governing mutual and private funds this includes asset segregation asset custody prevention of conflicts of interest investment restrictions asset valuation information disclosure investors’ choice and unitization of members’ rights   provident fund is managed by private fund manager who is approved by the sec and appointed by the asset management company the sec is the registrar of provident funds registers amendments to the fund articles and gives advice on members’ rights     more information on provident funds is available at httpwwwthaipvdcom     content other instruments   derivative warrants dw   derivative warrant is an instrument that gives holders the right to buy or sell the underlying securities or the right to earn profits from dw prices or underlying asset’s index at present the sec allows an offer for sale of dw with securities as the underlying asset a dw issuer is a third party which is not the listed company issuing the underlying securities generally there are two types of derivative warrant as follows    dw having no assetssecurities as collateral the risk of such dw is subject to an issuer’s obligation to deliver the underlying securities or pay the differences to grant an approval for offering of noncollateral dw the sec considers the issuer’s risk management financial condition and operating system eligible issuers are securities companies or commercial banks having in place a robust risk management system financial stability and effective control and operation    dw having assetssecurities as collateral in full the risk of such dw is on the safety of the collateral instead of the issuer’s risk
