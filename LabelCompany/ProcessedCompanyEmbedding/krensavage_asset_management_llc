dubious value its mostrecent failure a topical lidocaine to prevent the pain of gynecological procedures helped consume almost  million on research and development during the last two years lidocaine is a proven painkiller available in overthecounter sunburn lotions yours still managed to failthe lidocaine debacle follows junipers failed bid to develop a progesterone gel prochieve to prevent preterm birth  physicians embrace progesterone as a prophylactic against premature labor juniper and a partner the former watson pharmaceuticals spent almost a decade and tens of millions of dollars testing prochieve on more than  pregnant women regulators in  rejected the drugnow juniper is threatening to repeat this pattern by testing a drug that delivers progesterone via a vaginal ring its development likely would consume tens of millions of dollars and take at least five years while providing no guarantees of safety and efficacyeven if junipers progesterone ring were to win approval it likely would compete with clones of an injectable progesterone approved in  makena the prospects are slim that juniper would ever recover its investmentjuniper also is considering the development of a vaginal ring for incontinence at first blush its potential tantalizes the ring would bypass the bodys firstpass metabolism and spare the patient side effects such as dry mouthbut a competing patch and gel that also avoids firstpass side effects have generated disappointing sales perhaps because they compete with generic pills that retail for pennies a patch sells over the counter for  a month teva

management we believe the companys obstinance underscores its utter contempt for those who have used their own money to buy shares of rti after krensavage complained about rtis spending to maintain the troubling status quo under ceo brian hutchison the company offered krensavage a single board seat—increasing the number of directors to  from following months of refusing to embrace any of the four highlyqualified nominees krensavage proposes for rtis may  annual meeting while we would prefer rti management focus on running the company instead of waging a proxy battle its offer falls short
