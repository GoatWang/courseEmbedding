can these innovations help the business wearable tech will open more doors when we consider wearable tech what do we think of the shortlived google glass bluetooth headphones or do we imagine futuristic devices that offer gaming and internet browsing on the move without the need for analog controls whatever the term evokes for each of us wearable tech will continue to become more commonplace in  with smartwatches and virtual reality headsets more fact than science fiction thanks to brands like apple and samsung the smartwatch is now available to the average consumer allowing them to enjoy a more immediate online connection than even their smartphone offers businesses can take advantage of this technology with short precise marketing campaigns tailored to tiny screens providing users with access to your services or browse your products on the move puts you ahead of your less technologically savvy competitors virtual reality will become more viable for companies’ marketing needs as the price of production drops this technology is ideal for showcasing forthcoming products or locations without needing to invest in physical prototypes trade shows provide the perfect place for this with immersive technology able to replace standard multimedia displays transforming promotional presentations into interactive experiences while the challenge of creating virtualreality videos may be offputting to smaller businesses it is more likely to engage potential customers particularly in the technology’s early days due to the novelty factor embedded communication is set to expand while webrtc web realtime communication is nothing new mobile webrtc offers businesses great potential with mobile search now a primary way in which users look for products or services companies can increase conversion rates by embedding realtime communication directly into the mobile experience with the use of an easily implemented mobile webrtc software development kit such as those from technology companies like agoraio businesses can seamlessly integrate simple clicktocall functionality into their app allowing customers to be able to speak with representatives quickly and easily communications as a service caas platforms offer audio andor visual interaction adding a personality or face to a business not only will customers feel as if the company genuinely wants to hear from them as opposed to competitors that bury their contact details at the bottom of a page or only offer a submission form but the convenience mobile webrtc affords makes interacting with a business feel like less of an ordeal if a potential customer is looking for a simple answer to a question a clicktocall function will make them more likely to call giving representatives a chance to convert them into buyers for troubleshooting purposes a customer now would be able to show what is wrong with something rather than just trying to explain it to the representative alleviating any friction that could arise if the customer can’t accurately describe what precisely is wrong autonomous agents will maximize productivity machines capable of learning are responsible for various innovations such as robots virtual personal assistants vpas such as apple’s siri and autonomous cars while robotics and selfdriving cars hold real fascination for the public smart machines focused on software offer a more immediate benefit technology like siri and google now is becoming more and more intelligent and serving as precursors to advanced autonomous agents virtual assistance connects to ambient user experiences with autonomous agents able to become the user’s central interface for interacting with an app or tool rather than using menus or buttons on a phone users can speak directly to the software navigating with a minimum of fuss businesses will be able to utilize this technology in their own apps reducing the level of handson interactivity needed the more convenient a brand’s software is to use the more impact it will likely make on users particularly with this technology still something of a novelty this goes hand in hand with mobile webrtc which offers a more dynamic connection to companies whether for shopping browsing or customer service businesses can use d printing to empower customers d printers are now widely available to consumers bringing cuttingedge technology into the home in a way many still find unbelievable despite their high cost d printers provide households with the means to create various products parts and supplies—provided they have access to the right plans businesses can capitalize on the popularity and power of d printing by offering specific product plans as paid downloads with production costs reduced for the business itself plans can be sold at fair prices offering customers the power to make items they would typically bring home from a store right in their own space not every single business will be able to use this but for those that can this will help to cut costly timeconsuming delivery processes customers are also more likely to pay for download plans from a reputable company in another country rather than opt for expensive international delivery or source a cheaper alternative in their area adaptive security architecture offers greater defense against unauthorized entry the complicated nature of digital commerce and online security may leave underresourced businesses unsure exactly how to combat the increasing threat of hackingbased attacks companies without inhouse experts or that neglect to source specialist security advice are more vulnerable to critical damage costing them money time and customers depending on perimeter defenses and rulebased security is no longer effective enough particularly with cloudbased platforms and apis standard business tools business it teams must focus on identifying and handling threats using selfprotective software and userbehavior analytics to keep crucial data as safe as possible at all times adaptive security architecture offers a dynamic solution and requires less input to perform its duties while this is more time consuming to set up than traditional security software it offers greater protection and reduces the risk of damage these  technology trends will be driving business forward in the  like it is in

technology permalink gallery how to use a blog to boost your business business operations business technology business tools other social media strategy for small business how to use a blog to boost your businessnowadays a business website is considered incomplete if it doesn’t have a blog blogging started out as a mere hobby an online journal where individuals would share their thoughts feelings experiences and opinions however businesses have found that blogging is also a valuable resource for lead generation customer service boosting search engine rankings and brand marketing and promotion today we give you a number of ways starting your own business blog could give your business a much needed boost in the right direction  get more online exposure businesses devote entire departments to marketing where the only goal is to constantly think of the next big promotion event or advertisement that can lure customers in nowadays instead of investing money in other online marketing tactics more companies are opting for the creating a company blog according to a recent study company websites with blogs get  more traffic with  of marketers saying that blogging is the most important type of content marketing a company blog as long as it is carefully maintained can be an infinite source of leads for the company engaging content will bring in interested viewers who will then share your blog posts to other people who might need them free advertising at its best  cement your reputation as an industry professional customers are more likely to give you their hardearned money if they can see that you as a company know what you’re talking about blogs are a great way to disseminate important information that your target audience might find useful for example if your company is a provider of loans having a few articles on how to save money raise one’s credit score and ensure loan application success gives off the impression that your company is knowledgeable in all matters concerning your field  promote more customer interaction before customers could only reach a company through phone or email customers felt that businesses were distant and uncaring of their needs blogging is a great way to close the gap between consumers and businesses at the end of every blog post consumers can share their thoughts about the post and the company as a whole through the comments section businesses can place someone in charge of answering these comments to encourage interaction this makes businesses seem more “human” in the eyes of a consumer which helps convert leads existing customers are more loyal to companies who will take note of their suggestions and make changes in the company accordingly  boost search engine rankings blogs make business websites appealing not only to visitors but to search engines as well imagine each blog you write is a separate page that can be indexed giving you more chances of being found on search engines around  billion searches are made by people each day now imagine if even a small fraction of these people find their way to your website let’s say your company sells dietary products online and you have several blog articles on dieting so the next time someone searches for “common diet myths” for example if you have a blog post on diet myths your blog post has a chance of showing up on the search engine results the more blog posts you have the more likely you’ll have something that someone out there is searching for google’s algorithm keeps changing but some of their basic rules don’t change search engines like google favor pages with longer content around  and value viewer retention more than number of views so it matters less how many people view a certain page and more how long they stay engaged with that page blog posts with interesting content especially those with images and videos embedded on them can sustain the interest of viewers for several minutes  get extra income for your company while the main purpose of company blogs is to attract new customers interact with old ones convert viewership to sales and boost brand reputation there’s nothing wrong with making a little bit of money on the side there are a variety of ways for you to monetize your company blog from wellplaced ads to affiliate marketing affiliate marketing is basically earning commission for referring another business for example if your business provides renovation and repair services you can apply as an affiliate for manufacturers of construction materials and fixtures then on your company’s blog you can write a review on these manufacturers linking to their website in the process every time a viewer clicks on the link and makes a purchase you make a commission from it conclusion blogging can greatly affect a company’s reputation online exposure customer service and income generation making it a powerful tool that is accessible even to smaller and newer businesses being new and having fewer resources is no excuse to ignore the benefits of blogging in fact business with blogs experience  more lead growth compared to businesses without a blog who knows blogging might just be the key to transforming your virtually unknown business into a thriving influential powerhouse share thisgooglefacebooktwitterlinkedinmoreemailredditprintby marc prosser t may th business operations business technology business

global markets at levels previously limited to enterprise companies new marketing techniques payment methods inventory management tools and development tools – all of these are being made possible by rapid changes in technology and small businesses are the ones who are winning below are the top five trends you should keep an eye out for during the rest of the year emv chip technology now that security is at the top of the minds of most consumers emv chip technology is gaining popularity as these chips make it difficult for malicious individuals to create fake payment cards traditional credit cards use magnetic strips which contain unchanging information when an attacker gains access to the information they’re easily able to clone the cards and use it for malicious purposes emv chips on the other hand generate codes for each transaction if an attacker were to gain access to these databases they wouldn’t be able to use the codes for future purchases since emv technology is fairly new most small businesses need to overhaul their credit card processing software and terminals with modern versions which support reading the chips   ecommerce business now that many point of sale pos systems have ecommerce support builtin small businesses are able to leverage the best of both digital and instore customers leading to greater sales  popup shops for example enable small businesses to test new revenue streams engage with customers offline improve brand awareness and also educate new customers on product offerings at the end of the season sales don’t have to stop because your online properties can stay open throughout the year analytics tools business analytics tools are becoming increasingly popular while they were mostly considered useful for large corporations small businesses are beginning to realize the value of realtime data and use analytics tools why because analytics tools help small businesses see what they’re doing wrong what’s working for them and how to improve there are many tools for different aspects of your business such as social media email and marketing campaigns most popular of these tools is google analytics by allowing all your data to converge on one platform small businesses can now leverage their new found information to make informed decisions inventory management software inventory management is one of the biggest challenges small businesses face because they often don’t have the ability to dedicate individuals to handle the tasks this often results in wasted stock and lost goods fortunately modern inventory management software makes it easier than ever for small business to keep track of inventory simply by scanning barcodes and then having the data digitally logged into their systems mobile applications although they used to be limited to larger companies many small businesses are beginning to launch their own mobile apps tools such as the microsoft powerapps tool are making it easy for

communications capabilities within their code this means you can seamlessly integrate video chat into your apps as a new way to communicate with your customers and enhance the overall experience

technology running a small business email ethics what small business owners can learn from the latest political scandalsthe conversations centered on hillary clinton’s email practices and the leaked dnc email messages have probably not escaped your notice regardless of political affiliation or viewpoint on the controversies i think there’s one thing we might all agree on as business owners it’s important to treat our email communications with care we can learn some valuable lessons from the email mistakes and oversights made by individuals in the public’s eye and we should also think about how we might avoid other sorts of damaging email mishaps never badmouth a colleague vendor competitor or client in your email messages never ever assume the only person reading your email will be the one you’ve directly sent it to if a recipient forwards your email you never know where it might land and even if no one forwards it your sentiments could travel by good oldfashioned word of mouth that’s not fair to whomever you’re having issue with a direct constructive conversation with the person—not a snarky behindtheback email— will always be the way to go be ultrawary of whom you send anything deemed confidential or proprietary via email has the person you’re sharing with agreed to treat the information as such is there an agreement in place that could land you in hot water for sharing certain pieces of information and if you’re not sure whether or not information should be kept close to the vest find out before you share it with someone else before you hit “send” doublecheck to make sure you’ve included only the intended recipients in the “to” “cc” and “bc” fields this will help you avoid sending confidential information to people you shouldn’t have disclosed it to also if you ignored the advice in the first bullet point above and have vented frustration about someone doublechecking recipients will help you avoid accidentally sending your message to the person you’ve written about and yes…i know of people to whom this has happened avoid bcing blind copying people on email messages people typically bc other people in emails when they secretly want to inform those people of what they’ve sent to a “to” recipient but if a bc’ed person “replies all” the gig is up and it can destroy trust and create hard feelings with the direct recipient consider keeping others informed by ccing them instead that way it’s all out in the open or if you really don’t want the “to” recipient to know you’ve shared your email with someone else forward it instead it’s still a bit sneaky but less risky than a bc  read your email messages out loud to assess tone and clarity without the benefit of facial expressions and vocal inflections email messages can oh so easily become misinterpreted always read them out loud to yourself before sending them that will help you pick up on any hint of harsh attitude that might make recipients feel defensive or angry it will also enable you to check how clearly you’re communicating if your email is too longwinded redundant or confusing simplify it so it states what you want to share without making recipients work too hard to understand it whether you’re just starting a business or running an existing one email is among the most effective triedandtrue communications tools you’ll have at your disposal but as these recent political email scandals have demonstrated none of us should take it for granted give your email messages the attention and respect they deserve consider the tips i’ve shared so you don’t fall

and with so much new and emerging technology available to new business owners it’s difficult to know when it’s wise to spend the money and when to just sit tight jim browning research vice president for gartner outlined four guidelines for managing it expenses when he spoke at the midsize enterprise summit it’s good advice for those who want to start a business too here are some rules of thumb to help evaluate when investing in technology makes sense for your business align your technology with your business goals browning says to start by evaluating how each of your technology investments serves your business goals a principle he calls “doing less with less” a technology budget for a typical office will include items such as internet service computers tablets smartphones scanners copiers printers and shredders depending on your line of business you may need additional specialized equipment for instance a company with heavy graphic design video production or teleconferencing needs might invest in a monitor with k capability to get double the resolution available make a list of your existing equipment as well as equipment you’re considering purchasing and identify what role each serves in advancing your business goals when evaluating how your technology serves your business goals you should keep your financial goals in mind how much does each piece of technology contribute toward generating a return on investment roi in comparison to its expense when evaluating this consider your total cost of investment tco not just the direct cost of purchase direct costs of purchasing equipment only contribute about  percent toward total tco gartner estimates the other  percent consists of expenses for labor tech support and maintenance when these other costs are factored in a  pc might actually end up costing  over a threeyear period remember to factor in tco when calculating your roi this means it’s important to consider factors such as the quality of a vendor’s customer service and tech support when purchasing equipment map out each purchase decision and its rationale to make sure you’re getting a good return on your equipment investments one other factor to consider when calculating roi is tax deductions one advantage of buying equipment over leasing it is that you can deduct the full purchase price your first year standardize your technology standardizing your technology is another key to lowering your costs when investing in technology says browning this includes both simplifying your technological environment and reducing the number of vendors you work with for instance if you have a byod policy and your employees are using a wide range of different devices and operating systems this increases the range of potential technology integrations version updates and security risks you need to manage thereby increasing your administrative time and costs establish a byod policy that limits your employees to specific mobile device platforms and operating system versions similarly standardizing your other hardware and software selections will lower your total cost of ownership by improving manageability segment your users a third key to keeping your technology purchases on budget is segmenting your users at most companies different types of employees will have different technology needs however allowing everyone to have an individual technology profile will needlessly multiply your equipment and support costs the solution is to define a set number of technology profiles within your company restricting which equipment and applications different types of users should have access to to keep your company’s number of technology profiles manageable most organizations should have no more than three to five different technology profiles browning says go with good enough when possible browning’s fourth guideline for keeping technology equipment investments under budget is going with “good enough” when possible you
