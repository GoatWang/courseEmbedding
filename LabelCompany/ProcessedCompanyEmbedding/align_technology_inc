which probiotic supplement works best probiotic supplements have been on the rise as more and more adults today start feeling the troubling side effects of poor gut balance the good news is that ever since the research and development in the cultivation of “good gut bacteria” has evolved the popularity of probiotic supplements has been rising and rising our initial survey found an impressive amount of positive reviews from people using probiotic supplements we received encouraging reports from users all over the country amazingly these pills seem to work and though we love when new natural alternatives come to market it often creates a breeding ground for companies who want to prey upon consumers with a true need of improving their digestive health these companies run ads for their products using false claims that have never been tested by a trustworthy independent group to make matters worse many of these companies have formulas that don’t contain the right ingredients in the correct proportions to be effective rendering them worthless at improving your digestive health with so many different brands we decided it was time to perform a comprehensive review top  signs you should be taking probiotics taken antibiotics antiinflammatory pain meds or birth control in the last few years experienced digestive issues such as constipation diarrhea gas bloating upset stomach or have even had food poisoning at some point noticing skin blemishes acne dullness in skin rosacea psoriasis or eczema feeling depressed moody irritable brain fog or low energy get colds or the flu frequently throughout the year the importance of a “balanced gut” our digestive system is a pretty amazing part of our body the gut breaks down food and liquids into their chemical components carbohydrates fats proteins which the body uses for energy and cellular regeneration it also regulates hormones and activates the immune system our gut microbiome is made up of trillions of microorganisms bacteria fungi and viruses when in balance the good bacteria in your gut keep you healthy by preventing an overgrowth of bad bacteria such as harmful microbes yeasts and parasites which can cause an imbalance what is “leaky gut” syndrome our gut microflora creates a barrier on the intestinal wall keeping out pathogenic germs from escaping the intestines and leaking into our blood stream leaky gut is when this barrier is disturbed because of a microbial imbalance allowing harmful pathogens to enter the bloodstream our immune system sees the invading germs and launches a full scale immune response building up antibodies to fight back the problem is that the immune system attacks healthy cells as well as the bad ones as these attacks continue over time it can lead to a variety of health problems a “leaky gut” may not be your fault the reality is that antibiotics pain pills and prescription medications destroy both the bad and the good bacteria in your gut the processed foods we eat and the sodas we drink are often genetically modified and loaded with harmful ingredients chemical additives are present in everything from the air we breathe sun screen and lotions we slather on our skin to the household and industrial cleaners we use in our homes all of this comes together to create a perfect storm in the form of an imbalance between your good and bad gut bacteria leading to gut and immune system disruption the results of this imbalance can be painful digestive issues such as irritable bowel syndrome ibs gas bloating constipation diarrhea and heartburn the internal imbalance can also reveal itself on the outside with skin conditions such as acne rosacea psoriasis and even eczema and if all of that was not bad enough an imbalance in your gut microbiome can result in depression low energy and memory and recall issues this is why it is critical to rebalance your gut with a “quality” probiotic “good gut” bacteria secrets you may not have

encouraging reports from users all over the country amazingly these pills seem to work and though we love when new natural alternatives come to market it often creates a breeding ground for companies who want to prey upon consumers with a true need of improving their digestive health these companies run ads for their products using false claims that have never been tested by a trustworthy
