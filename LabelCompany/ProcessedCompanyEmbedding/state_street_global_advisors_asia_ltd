outperform larger capitalization companies over the long term volatility volatility creating a portfolio with lower volatility or tilting towards lower risk stocks can likely generate a higher

companies are rewarded with better returns over the longer term because they are better at deploying capital and generating wealth momentum momentum stocks that have done well recently tend to carry

implementing smart beta reported moderatetosignificant improvement in meeting their longterm aims see how your peers are solving their challenges with smart beta enhance index exposure case study challenge an investor with a us billion portfolio invested in a passive sp  index strategy wanted to remain passive but achieve better riskadjusted returns solution reduce risk and improve return by mixing passive and smart beta strategies the investor wished to capture value and low volatility factor premia with its smart beta allocations results increased historical returnsreduced historical volatility improve return potential case study challenge a ukbased defined benefit pension scheme was seeking ways to improve the return potential of their traditional market cap equity portfolio the investor was cognizant of the current strategy’s limitations and its vulnerability to large exposures to highlyvalued sectors and stocks solution the client chose ssga’s multifactor smart beta strategy consisting of value quality and volatility factors to improve riskadjusted returns and diversification of its core passive allocation the client decided this was a more costeffective and transparent solution that required relatively low governance when compared to a traditional active portfolio read the full case study results costefficient diversification seek better outcomes for matched portfolios case study challenge a us defined benefit fund wanted to improve its fixed income performance relative to liabilities without jeopardizing funding status the client wanted to extract the quality premium from credit while maintaining duration yield rating and maturity of the liabilitydriven benchmark solution state street global advisors worked with the client to design a factorbased solution aligned with the investor’s goal of improving return potential while continuing to match assets and liabilities the approach tilted towards higher quality measured by default risk adjusted for value ultimately the qualitytilted solution delivered   bps of excess performance net of advisory fees read the full case study results funding preserved better returns avoid overdiversifying active exposure case study challenge a us nonprofit with assets invested by a number of active managers asked ssga to conduct a riskbased analysis of its public equity portfolio to understand the drivers of active return portfolios that use multiple active strategies may suffer from overdiversification with managers’ particular styles cancelling each other out our analysis showed the overall active risk of the aggregate portfolio was low high exposure to volatile equities and negative exposure to value meaning the portfolio favoured expensive stocks solution reallocate a portion of the active portfolio to smart beta strategies that provide certain desirable factor exposures that may not be reflected in the portfolio of active managers such as value and low volatility design allows for potentially higher active risk greater flexibility more control and simplicity read the full case study results focused exposures reduced fees longterm return targeting across market cycles case study challenge as part of a portfolio review a manager of dc plans sought options to help achieve specific factor exposure to improve returns over the long term solution recognizing that market timing is notoriously difficult we helped build a solution providing exposure to three underlying traditional factors instead of one our client appreciates that the multifactor strategy permits them to take simple factor exposures — the simplicity and transparency of ssga’s methodology in building the factor was a key attraction as an early adopter of the multifactor approach our client has since expressed interest in pursuing a similar strategy for its emerging market equity exposure in partnership with state street global advisors read the full case study

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
