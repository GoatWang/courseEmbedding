announced today that it has entered into various agreements acquiring through its subsidiary ramaco resources land holdings llc approximately  acres of coal properties in tazewell and buchanan counties virginia and mcdowell county west virginia from jewell ridge coal corporation jewell ridge an indirect subsidiary of the brinks company  as part of the transaction ramaco acquired several coal leaseholds adjacent to its knox creek operations among the assets acquired ramaco became the sublessor of revelation energy llc revelation which now operates several underground coal mines formerly owned by a subsidiary of suncoke energy inc suncoke and which still supply coal to suncokes nearby jewell coke plant however ramaco also acquired significant properties that are not subleased to revelation in close proximity to ramacos knox creek preparation plant and norfolk southern loadout which may be developed in the future in addition to receiving royalty income from the acquired properties ramaco will immediately begin planning development of those portions of the properties not currently subleased to revelation  ramacos management estimates that the acquisition will yield approximately  million mineable tons of metallurgical coal once exploration and reserve analysis efforts are completed  ramaco intends to enter into additional subleases with neighboring coal operators as well as develop its own mid and lowvolatile metallurgical coal mines  ramaco will also explore the potential for remining two existing coal refuse areas which could contain saleable metallurgicalquality material which was a byproduct of processing coal prior to the implementation of more modern coal processing technology michael bauersachs ramacos president and chief executive officer noted that ramacos strong balance sheet was the key driver in completing this transaction  we were able to provide proper assurance to both jewell ridge and our new lessors of our ability to perform in the future which was critical given our posture as a relatively new coal producer  this transaction meets our disciplined criteria of acquiring metallurgical coal reserves near existing
