avenue carpinteria ca  view offices company about procore careers contact partners press about procore about procore careers contact partners press about procore the  most widely used construction management software letter from the ceo procore isnt a story of overnight success its a story of trial and error and perseverance ive always been a builder at heart from a young age i was fascinated by construction my father always seemed to have a construction project underway watching those projects take shape i learned that i was drawn to people who value hard work and who see building as their craft and calling in the eighth grade i started working in a cabinet shop after school sweeping the floors i worked construction jobs while in high school and college and i ended up choosing to swing a hammer fulltime on job sites in the san francisco bay area rather than complete my last two years of school in  my life and career took a turn into technology when i met a man who would become my mentor for the next decade he introduced me to creating software another form of building that became a new passion i found myself at the center of the technology boom in silicon valley learning to code and solving enormous engineering challenges in  i started my own software development company focused on web applications the timing could not have been better that company grew and by  i found myself working like crazy and also married with a newborn son the need for procore came from actual problems i was having as the owner on a construction project to build a new home for my family phone calls and fax machines were the default communication modes with my contractor when i looked at the sheer complexity of coordination and the lack of streamlined communication i was shocked that anything ever got done on my own construction project my first step to improve this situation was to build a webbased collaboration tool around our microsoft project schedule for the job this tool made it possible to gather feedback from team members as to what was actually going to happen against the plan we began to avoid mistakes on the job site by just getting everyone on the same page my construction experience combined with my knowledge of software development seemed to be solving a big problem thats when procore was born i decided to take a year off from my software development company and focus on discovering the needs of the construction market i visited job sites and learned about the inefficiencies that project managers faced on a daily basis a daily job log two week lookaheads a system for managing rfis and a way to share project schedules were the first tools that i built into a new webbased application that i called procore procore didnt take off right away after a few years of building the company i almost lost my shirt my home and just about everything else back in  most people working in construction didnt use email for work tasks only a handful of my target customers had any internet access at the job site smart phones and tablets were still years away—and widespread adoption of these devices by project teams was more than a decade in the future so i saw the opportunity but the market i wanted to serve wasnt ready yet we had to show most of our early customers how a project management software application was going to make their work—and their lives—better if it wasnt for a few early adopters and the steady partnership i found in steve zahm procore would have gone out of business many times in the early days in the years since procore has grown to be the most used construction software application on the planet and its my sincere intention and that of the hundreds of procore employees with whom i have the pleasure of working to continue that growth we are always focused on making procore better faster and more useful my passion has always been in construction i still value hard work and the rewards of building something from the ground up when people ask me what my goal is for the future of procore its simple i never want to stop providing people in the construction industry with tools that make their lives easier tooey

press about procore the  most widely used construction management software letter from the ceo procore isnt a story of overnight success its a story of trial and error and perseverance ive always been a builder at heart from a young age i was fascinated by construction my father always seemed to have a construction project underway watching those projects take shape i learned that i was drawn to people who value hard work and who see building as their craft and calling in the eighth grade i started working in a cabinet shop after school sweeping the floors i worked construction jobs while in high school and college and i ended up choosing to swing a hammer fulltime on job sites in the san francisco bay area rather than complete my last two years of school in  my life and career took a turn into technology when i met a man who would become my mentor for the next decade he introduced me to creating software another form of building that became a new passion i found myself at the center of the technology boom in silicon valley learning to code and solving enormous engineering challenges in  i started my own software development company focused on web applications the timing could not have been better that company grew and by  i found myself working like crazy and also married with a newborn son the need for procore came from actual problems i was having as the owner on a construction project to build a new home for my family phone calls and fax machines were the default communication modes with my contractor when i looked at the sheer complexity of coordination and the lack of streamlined communication i was shocked that anything ever got done on my own construction project my first step to improve this situation was to build a webbased collaboration tool around our microsoft project schedule for the job this tool made it possible to gather feedback from team members as to what was actually going to happen against the plan we began to avoid mistakes on the job site by just getting everyone on the same page my construction experience combined with my knowledge of software development seemed to be solving a big problem thats when procore was born i decided to take a year off from my software development company and focus on discovering the needs of the construction market i visited job sites and learned about the inefficiencies that project managers faced on a daily basis a daily job log two week lookaheads a system for managing rfis and a way to share project schedules were the first tools that i built into a new webbased application that i called procore procore didnt take off right away after a few years of building the company i almost lost my shirt my home and just about everything else back in  most people working in construction didnt use email for work tasks only a handful of my target customers had any internet access at the job site smart phones and tablets were still years away—and widespread adoption of these devices by project teams was more than a decade in the future so i saw the opportunity but the market i wanted to serve wasnt ready yet we had to show most of our early customers how a project management software application was going to make their work—and their lives—better if it wasnt for a few early adopters and the steady partnership i found in steve zahm procore would have gone out of business many times in the early days in the years since procore has grown to be the most used construction software application on the planet and its my sincere intention and that of the hundreds of procore employees with whom i have the pleasure of working to continue that growth we are always focused on making procore better faster and more useful my passion has always been in construction i still value hard work and the rewards of building something from the ground up when people ask me what my goal is for the future of procore its simple i never want to stop providing people in the construction industry with tools that make their lives easier tooey courtemanche ceo procore was built on three fundamental ideas listen to the problems our customers have develop easytouse solutions
