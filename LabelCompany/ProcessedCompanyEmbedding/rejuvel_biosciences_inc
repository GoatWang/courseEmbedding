producing distributing marketing and selling antiaging skincare products in addition to engaging in the environmental management and water purification industries          badly faked photoshop  the company conducts its business through two separate wholly owned subsidiaries rejuvel intl inc and nueearth inc nuuu’s management team is methodically establishing its brand in the marketplace with wellrespected associations and strategic marketing initiatives as the company continues to pursue direct consumer sales and other opportunities it stands to do well with the foundation management has laid for growth nuuu recently reached agreements with three shareholders including the current ceo of the company to exchange or buy back and retire a total of  shares of common stock which represents  of nuuu’s total outstanding shares as a result the company’s outstanding shares were reduced from roughly  million to  million nuuu rejuvel   investment highlights operates through two established subsidiaries utilizing patented nasa technology admitted into space certification program revolutionary antiaging skin care products addressing global water purification concerns   patented technology the key manufacturing element to nuuu’s skin care product is the company’s use of the patented nasa rotating wall vessel rwv bioreactor licensed from the national aeronautics and space administration and administrators of the tulane educational fund under us patent no  representative of the depth of the nasa partnership melanie saunders associate director for the johnson space center in july  welcomed nuuu chief executive officer charles scimeca to a ceremony to sign an additional exclusive patent license marking a continuing relationship between nasa and the cosmetic and personal care product company for a full report on this event click here from cosmic to cosmetics nasa bioreactor technology finds new purpose developing beauty products   rejuvel subsidiary revolutionary antiaging facial cream created utilizing a nasa patented technology as we age elasticity decreases blotching and wrinkles appear our skin shows uneven skin tones and discoloration rejuvel’s latest product re’juvel repairs your skin from within using products that counteract the effects of time with ingredients that restore its youth and resiliency just exactly how re’juvel counters the effects of aging is a matter of science nasa scientists and astronauts in collaboration with other engineers developed a bioreactor tested in space and proven on earth this device allows the growth and multiplication of plant andor mammalian cells in simulated weightlessness these cells are grown threedimensionally just like in the human body the key ingredient in re’juvel’s product formula is a blend of plant and mammalian d cell cultures that work on the cellular level to increase hydration visibly reduce lines wrinkles and enhance skin health these cells were all grown using nasa patented technology fibroblast skin cells are naturally found in the layers of human skin the fibroblast cell’s function is to biosynthesize the connective tissue that provides structural support and plays a critical role in the skin’s healing process fibroblast cells are responsible for making collagens elastic fibers and glycoproteins the human body generates less fibroblast cells as it ages thus creating wrinkles sagging and blemishes re’juvel’s formulation stimulates the growth of fibroblast cells which keeps skin looking firmer longer clinical product study technology applications international corporation completed a clinical study to test the efficacy of the re’juvel product line at essex testing clinic in verona new jersey team members on the essex testing clinic staff included doctors nurses clinical study recruitment professionals quality assurance and trained evaluators and a large network of consulting physicians all possessing considerable experience in clinical investigation after  weeks of product use  subjects responded with the following  – smoother and softer skin  – facial skin had an improved texture  – product regimen was gentle and nonirritating  – appearance of fine lines on face is less noticeable  – appearance of wrinkles on face is less noticeable  – improvement in the firmnesselasticity of skin  – reduction in the appearance of dark under the eye circles  – skin appeared renewed and discolorations were reduced  – moisture content in skin had increased  – skin appears brighter and more radiant  – skin appears healthier  – skin appears refreshed  – overall appearance was improved scientific measurements results after  weeks of use are as follows  of subjects fine lines wrinkles were significantly reduced  of subjects under eye discoloration significantly improved  of subjects firmness elasticity significantly improved  of subjects skin moisture significantly improved recent highlights filmed with intent to air first second television

recognized physicist and multidisciplinary technologist with a broad spectrum of scientific interests and technological expertise ranging from nanotechnologybased broadspectrum antiviral therapeutics to d suspended cell cultures in a simulated microgravity environment for cosmetics and regeneration medicine as well as environmental and medical applications of electron beam accelerators and microwave assisted freeze drying extraction and distillation  licensed from the national aeronautics and space administration and administrators of the tulane educational fund under us patent no    nueearth inc subsidiary nueearth provides environmental management solutions and water purification techniques using a mobile electron beam accelerator unit which creates highenergy electrons that produce free radicals in the wastewater to decompose organic compounds or pollutants the company has identified a number of different markets for this particle accelerator technology including the removal of pollutants from wastewater drinking water municipal sludge and water that’s contaminated by the fracking process industry there is an urgent demand for reuse of reclaimed municipal and industrial wastewater as well as of remediation of water resources contaminated by industry and agriculture a major problem in wastewater treatment is that industrial wastewaters are usually mixed with municipal wastewaters conventional drinking water treatment processes were not designed to remove trace quantities of pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics and endocrine disrupting chemicals given the increasing number of reports of its presence in the environment it is essential that alternative technologies be developed that can effectively degrade or remove these compounds one of the most promising alternative technologies is use of ebeam accelerators for purification of water through advanced oxidationreduction process which is induced by highenergy electrons blasted into biologically or chemically polluted water ebeam treatment may be combined with other advanced oxidation techniques such as addition of ozone o which further enhances the effectiveness of the pollutant degradation the key distinction of the ebeam treatment technology compared to various filterbased technologies is its advanced reductionoxidation process induced by ebeam it results in an ultimate destruction of dangerous chemicals in the treated medium while passive filterbased technologies retain the unwanted contaminants removed from polluted water however using ebeam accelerators for chemical purification of drinking water municipal and industrial wastewaters is still considered an emerging technology despite multiple pilot plants and a few fullscale treatment facilities established around the world the application of electron beam processing for drinking water wastewater and groundwater treatment offers a cost effective process that insures adequate availability of that resource worldwide potable water is the cornerstone of development and essential for sustainable growth the first consideration for drinking water is to produce water that has been disinfected as mentioned above the most common process is disinfection of drinking water by chlorine and some chlorination by products may be carcinogenic or have other toxicological effects associated with consumption also new pathogens are emerging that are not easily inactivated by chlorine therefore the water treatment industry worldwide is eagerly trying to discover alternatives to disinfection by chlorine in addition to disinfection there is an increasing problem with the presence of toxic chemicals in source waters waters used as sources of drinking water these source waters may be surface waters or groundwater surface waters often are influenced by the discharge of treated wastewater and the biological and chemical quality compromised ground waters used as a source of drinking water may also be contaminated in general if the quality of groundwater is compromised it is the result of chemical contamination waste water remediation by ebeam processing is promising due to a number of features that make this an attractive process for commercial application several advantages in the application of electron beam processing are both oxidizing and reducing reactive species are formed in relatively the same proportion in aqueous media and then react with a pollutant the ebeam remediation process can be used for simultaneous control of biological and chemical hazards the ebeam process is a physical process and requires no additional chemicals the process is extremely rapid allowing for maximum flexibility in plant design and combination with more conventional wastewater pretreatment technologies while similar in its mechanism of action to gamma ray processing the ebeam process does not involve any nuclear materials the electron accelerators only require electricity to operate the systems are totally automated for ease of operation the underlying scientific basis for the application process to solving water pollution problems is as well established as any technology that is already in use however large scale commercialization of the ebeam technology has been relatively slow so very few fullscale ebeam waste water treatment plants currently exist   space certification awarded a “seal of approval” from the space certification program the origin of nuuu’s re’juvel product comes directly from technology and resources derived from the space program which qualifies the company as a

crucial in the foundation of skin health these cells are naturally found in the layers of human dermal tissue performing a vital function by biosynthesizing the connective tissue that provides structural support and plays a critical role in the skin’s healing process fibroblast cells are also responsible for producing collagen elastic fibers and glycoproteins which are all critical elements of healthy youthful skin as we get older the body produces fewer amounts of fibroblast cells resulting in the key signs of aging such as wrinkles sagging and dryness biomimetic suspension the benefits of rejuvel d products begin with a bioreactor developed by nasa scientists and engineers which creates a suspended microgravity environment by using a rotating vessel to grow cell cultures experts found that this stressfree environment allowed the cell cultures to grow in a threedimensional state much like how cells grow in the human body these cells are more equivalent to natural skin cells and they were also exposed to an increased amount of nutrients and functioned in a more complete manner the results unearthed a major skincare breakthrough when compared to commonly used twodimensional methods which force the cells to grow in a restrictive area leaving them deformed and poorly functioning rejuvenate with science the biomolecules released by these potent d cell

how to treat the inevitable wounds and diseases that astronauts will get was it possible to grow cells in space that might be able to provide say replacement skin or organs nasa researchers asked well not only was the growing of cells possible astronauts discovered that the cells also grow better in the microgravity of space than they do on earth forming threedimensional structures instead of just spreading across a flat surface the difference was so striking that researchers at johnson space center along with tulane university’s scientists including astronaut dr david wolf and inventor thomas goodwin wondered if the benefits could also be achieved on the ground they designed a rotating cylinder dubbed a rotating wall vessel bioreactor that keeps the cells and the growth medium suspended within the device to try and mimic the microgravity of space the idea worked the researchers were able to expand everything from human kidney and lung cells to human fibroblasts fibroblasts are a type of cell found in connective tissue that makes collagen a key protein in skin and other substances that aid in skin and tissue repair moreover the fibroblasts grown in microgravity increased collagen and other regenerative substances the scientists realized that the substances could be used in applications that would heal and rejuvenate skin they patented the rotating wall bioreactor and the various fields of use former nasa employees started a company to develop various uses of the bioreactor but struggled rejuvel saw the promise of the bioreactor technology and decided to bring the product to market after licensing the patents from nasa in order to find the most effective candidate ingredients they looked at a variety of cells and determined that of those which could be extracted from plants an ideal candidate was a type of green tea called “camellia” sinensis cells taken from the “callus” that the tea plant makes to cover a wound turned out to grow beautifully in the bioreactor and because callus cells resemble stem cells which can become any part of the plant they produce a wider variety of growth factors and other substances than a typical green tea leaf cell green tea extract has already been shown to have many health benefits including antiaging properties and natural uv ray sun protection among other substances it contains scores of compounds called flavonoids which are known to have antiinflammatory and other properties and which can help skin cells recover from sun damage and other injuries so it’s no surprise that many skin care products already contain extracts from the plant but rejuvel’s bioreactor using the green tea callus cells appears to make a much more potent and effective extract than is found in any other products they culture the cells differently using nasa patented technology to do so and their extract has more active components the extract is added to various creams mixed with a proprietary formula

science experience a scientific breakthrough with rejuvel d the first ever threedimensional skin renewal system using exclusively licensed nasa patented technology the science behind our products originates from space certified technology developed by astronauts studied by doctors and formulated to provide highly advanced skin renewal results licensed from the national aeronautics and space administration and administrators of the tulane educational fund under us patent nos  and  b and  b why does skin age fibroblast cells are crucial in the foundation of skin health these cells are naturally found in the layers of human dermal tissue performing a vital function by biosynthesizing the connective tissue that provides structural support and plays a critical role in the skin’s healing process fibroblast cells are also responsible for producing collagen elastic fibers and glycoproteins which are all critical elements of healthy youthful skin as we get older the body produces fewer amounts of fibroblast cells resulting in the key signs of aging such as wrinkles sagging and dryness biomimetic suspension the benefits of rejuvel d products begin with a bioreactor developed by nasa scientists and engineers which creates a suspended microgravity environment by using a rotating vessel to grow cell cultures experts found that this stressfree environment allowed the cell cultures to grow in a threedimensional state much like how cells grow in the human body these cells are more equivalent to natural skin cells and they were also exposed to an increased amount of nutrients and functioned in a more complete manner the results unearthed a major skincare breakthrough when compared to commonly used twodimensional methods which force the cells to grow in a restrictive area leaving them deformed and poorly functioning rejuvenate with science the biomolecules released by these potent d cell cultures are the key elements in rejuvel d’s formulas our products work on the cellular level to restore youthful volume by stimulating fibroblast cells that encourage skin renewal clinically tested results show increased hydration visible reduction of fine lines and wrinkles and enhanced overall skin health shop now
