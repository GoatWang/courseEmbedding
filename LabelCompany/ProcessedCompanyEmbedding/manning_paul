morning sensient reported adjusted earnings per share of  in the quarter an increase of  from last years first quarter result of  foreign currency reduced adjusted eps by  in the first quarter and in local currency adjusted eps grew  revenue was up  in local currency with color reporting high singledigit growth and asia pacific reporting mid singledigit growth adjusted operating income increased by  in local currency driven by strong results from both colors and flavors  fragrances colors operating income was up  in local currency on strong performances across the group flavors  fragrances operating income was up more than  in local currency with most of the groups businesses showing solid growth flavors  fragrances operating margin was up  basis points over last years first quarter result and sensients operating margin increased  basis points to  foreign currency translation reduced both revenue and adjusted operating income by approximately  in the quarter color had another very strong quarter with revenue and operating income increasing  and  respectively in local currency the cosmetics business continues to perform well reporting doubledigit growth in local currency for both revenue and operating income in the quarter the food colors business generated strong profit growth due in part to doubledigit sales growth of natural colors in north america both the pharma and inks businesses also improved solidly over last years results the groups operating margin remains solid improving to  in the first quarter our cosmetics business continues to see strong demand for makeup lipstick and other personal care products cosmetics has a strong innovation program which allows us to develop solutions for a wide range of applications including makeup skin nail and hair care and hair colors our success in cosmetics was broadbased with growth in every region of the world in the food and beverage markets we expect to see strong interest in natural colors for some time in  approximately  of all new product launches both in the us and globally featured natural colors many of the worlds largest food companies including some of the largest food retailers have announced their intention to use natural colors in their products we expect these conversions to take place gradually and consistently over the next few years thus far much of the near term conversion activity has been driven by local and regional manufacturers or privatelabel brands sensient is the market leader for food and beverage colors and we have developed proprietary technologies that allow our customers to offer natural products without compromising on the appearance or affecting the taste of their product were uniquely positioned to lead the conversion to natural colors because of our investments in new technologies and our applications expertise flavors  fragrances had a very good quarter reporting local currency operating income growth of  with an operating margin of  the operating margin improved  basis points from last years first quarter and this is the fourth consecutive quarter in which the groups operating margin increased by at least  basis points over the previous years result revenue was off by approximately  in local currency principally related to culling of lowmargin and nonstrategic products flavors  fragrances has made significant progress over the past two years with many of the groups businesses delivering profit growth and margin improvement in the first quarter most of the groups businesses reported higher profits with several achieving doubledigit profit growth likewise we saw operating margin improvement in most of the groups businesses were able to deliver these strong results even though we are still in the process of transitioning production out of the last of the facilities to be impacted by restructuring we incurred additional costs in the first quarter related to the extended transition and we expect some of these costs to continue into the second quarter we completed the sales of one of our european savory ingredient facilities and our european natural ingredients business which primarily sold dehydrated vegetables in the first quarter these businesses produced products that did not align with our strategy of selling flavors rather than ingredients they were dilutive to the groups operating profit margin and each had heavy working capital requirements these divestitures will eliminate approximately  million of revenue on an annual basis and they represent the last of the significant culling actions that we had discussed with you as we previously forecasted most of the revenue impact will occur in  the asia pacific results were off this quarter primarily due to order timing and product mix weve been investing in the asia pacific region and we expect to generate strong growth in these markets last year we opened a new rd center in singapore adding personnel and technical capabilities that allow us to work more closely with customers and to sell more products that align with our strategies in colors and flavors we are also expanding local production capabilities throughout the region to reduce costs and to shorten lead times overall the first quarter results for the company were in line with my expectations color continues to deliver strong results and flavors  fragrances overcame some challenges with production costs and had a very good quarter for the year i still expect color to deliver high singledigit profit growth and flavors  fragrances to deliver mid to high singledigit profit growth with margin improvement of between  and  basis points i also expect asia pacific to recover and achieve high singledigit and perhaps doubledigit profit growth for the year we are maintaining our adjusted eps guidance for the year adjusted eps growth will approach or exceed  in local currency terms we still think the strong dollar will have an impact on adjusted eps results for the year and we are maintaining our adjusted eps range of  to  were off to a good start for  and im very optimistic about the companys future steve will now provide you with additional details on the first quarter results stephen j rolfs thank you paul sensient reported revenue of  million in the quarter compared to  million in the first quarter of last year operating income was  million in the quarter compared to  million in last years first quarter the operating income results include restructuring and other costs of  million in the quarter and  million in the comparable period last year excluding the restructuring and other costs adjusted operating income was  million and  million in the first quarters of  and  respectively foreign currency translation reduced both revenue and adjusted operating income by about  in the quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were  in the quarter compared to  in the comparable period last year restructuring and other costs reduced earnings per share by  in this years first quarter and by  in last years first quarter adjusted earnings per share were  in the quarter and  in the comparable period last year foreign currency translation reduced adjusted eps by  per share in the first quarter in local currency adjusted earnings per share grew  as paul mentioned earlier we completed the sales of one of our savory ingredient facilities and our european natural ingredients business in the first quarter we recognized noncash losses on both transactions and these losses account for most of the  million that we reported as restructuring and other costs in the quarter cash flow from operations was  million in the first quarter compared to  million in last years comparable period the first quarter cash flow was reduced by higher incentive payments and a smaller reduction in inventory in our natural ingredients business compared to the first quarter of last year capital expenditures were approximately  million in the first quarter and we still expect capital expenditures to be between  million and  million for the year we repurchased approximately  shares during the first quarter our balance sheet remained strong adjusted debt to adjusted ebitda was  at the end of the quarter we plan to keep that level in line with our investment grade profile to maintain the flexibility for capital expenditures dividend payments share repurchases and acquisitions we will continue to take a balanced prudent and longterm approach to our capital allocation strategy which includes evaluating share repurchases and acquisitions on an opportunistic basis thank you very much for your time this morning well now open the call for your questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from mike sison from keybanc michael j sison paul when you think about – i wanted to get a little bit of a cadence for flavors  fragrances your volumes were down but as you noted you did show earnings growth so clearly the strategy there is working and i think you still have a little bit of culling coming right so can you maybe talk about areas in that segment that have shown organic growth and then maybe just a feel of when you think we turn the corner there on an organic growth basis recognizing your earnings growth has been its heading in the right direction paul manning sure so when i go back to the original guidance for the year and what weve communicated weve talked about flat revenue in flavors for  the idea there being we would have an impact from culling which would offset the growth that we would expect to get organically and therefore wed net out at about zero so that was kind of the concept now as i noted in the lead in here with my opening comments we did take out the next big part say effectively part  of  of culling the big chunk of that culling took place with the sale of that production site and the sale of that business in europe those two combined would represent about  million of annual revenue so the idea here is that that would be a big last chunk of culling some of that would bleed into  the first quarter of  i thought we would be able to sell that last facility at the start of the quarter we were not able to we were able to sell that at the end of the quarter the end of march and so therefore a little bit of that culling impact will bleed into q of  so thats just some background pieces what we had talked about after  where again we would anticipate netnet flat revenue we would then expect as we get into  and beyond we would strive internally and our goal and expectation would be mid singledigit top line growth in flavors and so what could i point to to the second part of your question that would demonstrate our ability to actually do that is that again ill note the businesses that are effectively through restructuring showed very good growth and it was fairly broadbased some of these businesses were in europe some were in the americas some of the traditional flavors types but we also had good top line growth in fragrances so i see very good growth i think that again the further we get away from restructuring i think the better we get towards that internal goal of mid singledigit top line growth michael j sison right and then sticking to flavors when you think about some of the areas where youve successfully moved from more of an ingredient to a solution any particular areas that you could point to that youre seeing some good success as well as types of customers that still the more the locals the regionals that youre winning those type of new wins paul manning i think for part one of your question i think weve seen that transition from ingredients to flavors on a very broad base across the group weve seen that progress in beverage weve seen that progress in fragrances weve seen it in a lot of our businesses where we had probably the furthest to go on that way would have been our savory business which i think ive highlighted on some of these calls before and so now we are seeing good progress within those businesses as well but i think weve demonstrated that based on the customers that we are focused on and effectively the competitors we have chosen we have demonstrated an ability to really execute on that strategy and provide that type of technology and application support to many of those companies that dont often receive that type of technology and application support so weve been very targeted in terms of our customers that we want to emphasize and to develop and to grow with and as you think you can appreciate that takes time and weve seen the fruits of many of those initiatives over the last couple of years so ive got a lot of confidence that this program works its a very big flavor market and theres a lot of companies right now and some would suggest that perhaps a lot of these big multinationals maybe theyre not launching as many products and so therefore youre seeing a lot of the growth is coming from these regional and national and local companies which perhaps are historically doing a lot more launches than they would have ever in the past so i think hitching our wagon to this group is a good thing to do and i think that weve demonstrated that again in a fairly broad base around the world and across each of these business units nevertheless i want to see more i think we can see more i think getting past all the restructuring is a big part of that and i think that having this broad base of customers has been very very productive and very very healthy for the business if you look at colors yes we attract the attention of all the big cpg companies around the world and so you may ask how are we still growing by  if those folks arent growing by that much because we made a concerted effort a number of years ago to expand that sales force and the technical force to go after again these regional local and national customers in anticipation that there may be a slowdown in the big multinationals and i think that it definitely bearing fruit today that along with our i think our belief that natural colors was the market of the future and that it was necessary to invest in cosmetics and a lot of the areas that were showing success today with michael j sison great and then one quick question on your balance sheet remains in really good shape your organic story is going well and so when you think about acquisitions and the ma environment is i guess heated but when you think about the opportunities out there is your focus more in color is it more on flavors and then would you consider a bigger more pronounced transaction if something comes up from some of these mega mergers in chemicals and such paul manning i would certainly say were open to a lot of different possibilities here obviously flavors in the context of the strategic change the organizational change the restructuring that wouldve been a tougher thing to try to buy and then integrate into the business but i think thats clearing up and so certainly there remains a possibility within the world of flavors and fragrances that there could be something that could fit nicely into our portfolio i would anticipate that would really be on the basis of a technology play a smaller company that we would pursue i think across color you could really consider that in a lot of the different segments perhaps less so on food colors than you could see on say pharma or inks or cosmetics or another one of those divisions but ma moves in cycles in my opinion we are perhaps at the peak of that cycle and as with all cycles they reach a trough and then when the trough is reached there are deals to be made and there are assets to be picked up at discounted prices i think what i have seen and in my opinion there is a distinct possibility that a company could very much overpay for an acquisition and you look at our balance sheet were  debttoebitda well you know if youre overpaying that thing doesnt work out your  may become  before you know it and now you got a different problem so were being very thoughtful and very disciplined about this its got to fit within the strategy that we have i would not anticipate making a market share related acquisition because i think in our case we would wind up overpaying for something like that and so i think to some degree its a matter of when is the right time and do you have something that fits in and that something could be as i think i hopefully have expressed here could really fit into any one of our businesses very nicely but food color is probably the lowest of the probability on that scale michael j sison great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of brett hundley from vertical group brett hundley paul i wanted to continue on that conversation regarding ma and the balance sheet just because you guys have improved your cash conversion you are continuing to make good on the broader restructuring thats been put in place and thats helping to drive margin it seems like youre getting around some culling work in flavors  fragrances and you continue to perform well in colors and so clearly as a lot of us put together our financial models not only for this year but in coming years we continue to see that leverage ratio work down towards x maybe even below at some point and so my question i wanted to revisit kind of what you view as an ideal leverage or net leverage ratio and if ma if we are at near a peak now and there are expectations from you guys that eventually that may come off and you want to be more of a value buyer what would you tell to shareholders today that see that leverage ratio working down see cash flow moving higher as it relates to capital allocation and cash return paul manning yes i would say this we have been very much number one i think in any year that i could either see now or even into the future i think capex will always be number one for us there is no pure form of investment there is no higher return to be gained in my opinion for this business than making efforts on investing in roi projects around the company despite perhaps some thoughts out there in the market that companies are not investing in roi projects i think thats totally false for us in any roi project that i can get my hands on id love to and id love to make those investments assuming we have a good business plan so i think thats going to continue to be number one and thats really for the longterm benefit of the company financially and operationally i think that makes a lot of sense number two for us has really historically been our dividend and we pay that out on a fairly disciplined scale a payout ratio of  to  id like to keep that in the cards moving forward i think thats been a successful program and its been an efficient way to return to many of our shareholders but you know i think the other piece then is all right is it debt is it acquisitions or is it – debt or acquisitions essentially so i think for us – or sorry repurchasing where weve been is i felt that for many years the stock was undervalued so we started buying back at  and i suppose at the end of the day we might have been onto something there weve done pretty well with that program before that we had paid down our debt as a company to very – i think we got to about  debttoebitda and we did that really ahead of the financial collapse of  and  and so i think weve been reasonably good at making these types of predictions about the market and where we think its going and so therefore as i go back to my ma comment i would predict that theres going to be an opportunity maybe in not too distant future where the ma world does move out of its peak pricing and go into more of a trough situation and that could be where you see us not buy any stock at all level up to an even higher than  ratio in the interest of capturing value in terms of ma so i think we as a company right now at  or  leverage and weve been kind of hovering in that area thats probably about right because it gives us the flexibility to lever up for an acquisition which may come in the near future but it certainly allows us to continue on course with our repurchasing program beyond meeting our capex and dividend needs of the company so thats kind of where i am at  feet if im wrong and the ma stays at a peak for the next five years i suppose that would be a historical anomaly big time in which case you may see us continuing to buy back more stock so does that kind of get it where youre going here brett hundley it does and i appreciate the color so if i can transition over to your flavors  fragrances segment weve talked previously about again how a lot of restructuring was concentrated there and youve talked historically about the stepchange that you want to see from a return on sales standpoint in your flavors  fragrances segment kind of akin to what you did in your colors group and youve kind of stepped that out all the way up to  i believe and i feel like a lot of us have good visibility and a good understanding of how you can improve margin over the nearterm given some of the color that youve given but i wanted to ask you if you could walk us through visibility and confidence that you have on these continued margin gains in flavors  fragrances maybe out in  and  and really try and get us comfortable with your ability to deliver on potentially bringing that margin up towards whatever you said  or so out towards  paul manning yes so two things on that i think number one what would give people confidence well we did this in color and we did this in flavor and in fact weve even exceeded those expectations in color i think on flavor as we move towards our expected  operating profit margin i think weve demonstrated certainly in the last year an accelerated version of that weve demonstrated our ability to grow this margin through the improvements that we had decided before product mix taken out costs culling these three factors i think have come together to bring us where we are today so then the natural question then becomes all right with culling essentially over at the end of this year a little bit of bleed into  that leaves effectively still improvements in product mix and taking out additional costs as i look at the flavor group i see both throughout the entire world theres definitely more opportunities to take out cost in that business theres definitely more opportunities to improve our mix in that business and i think that the mix is always thats the one that people would – i mean you can take out costs but really can you be successful selling the better mix of these products and there i would have to point to the many businesses in the flavor group right now which operate at that level of profitability that at or near  operating profit margin to me thats a very strong indication that we have a path weve achieved that path for many businesses and that so for the remaining businesses we certainly have a benchmark internally but i think weve had a set of actions and in particular for those businesses that have not experienced a restructuring hit where we have demonstrated an ability to really improve that mix very very strongly and find that part of the market the underserved part of the market thats less competitive than say dealing with a massive multinational where you may have three or four key competitors i think thats a huge part of this story and i think that is what weve said really for a few years now those themes and that execution and i think we continue to stay on track with that and we continue to stay on track with that because its working so i would suggest that as we move into  and you see an improvement in the top line for flavors thats going to have a very nice impact i think youre going to continue to see more cost coming out restructuring is part of it but as you then optimize that plan further theres always more opportunities to take out some of those costs there are certainly opportunities within raw material and transportation costs that can be addressed as well and so these get us to a path very strong path of the  i think brett hundley thats really helpful just one more from me if i can i just want to be crystal clear on what you called out in asia on order timing and mix so it sounds to me like youre expecting both to improve i would imagine that the order timing variable should very much overcompensate for q in coming quarters the mix i wanted to see if i could get a little bit more color on because i would imagine if there was a mix impact it was maybe somewhat unexpected in q that that might bleed into the remainder of the year so netnet i could understand things normalizing in the remainder of the year but starting off in a little bit of a hole in q so i was wondering if you could just talk to both of those issues and your visibility for those normalizing in the remainder of the year thank you paul manning so i would say this i think certainly i would anticipate asia pacific as i recommitted to in the opening monologue achieving the top line growth of high single digits that we talked about at the beginning of the year we think that is certainly still achievable yes theres certainly theres a little bit of a timing piece here that in q we were only about midsingledigit top line growth so i think with respect to the timing yes i think youre going to see an uptick throughout the remainder of the year that would then net us out to where we expected to be for asia pacific overall so i feel very good that we have good continued growth prospects in asia pacific i feel very good committing to those numbers again to you and to the rest of the investors because i do see a lot of opportunities in asia pacific and weve made a lot of investments there to get there but this is really kind of a phasing issue which then not unlike a different phasing issue we have in flavors so let me just kind of transition over to flavors because this fit with your earlier question and then mike sisons earlier questions about flavors and so francesco i know youre on the line too so youll certainly want to hear this piece as we look at q and as we look at specifically at guidance and you look specifically at flavors one thing i just want to kind of reiterate or certainly make a little bit more clear i think as you all recall last year q  we had the sale of the onetime import rights and that was a  benefit which went entirely to the flavor group so to the extent you have that in your q  baseline that would suggest that your q consensus is too high and so this gets into a little bit of phasing as you look at flavors and as you look at how this will come together to deliver what i told you we would get to for the year we have effectively a  difference here in terms of where we see our q and where you have our q from a consensus standpoint i think the difference is certainly that  related to that onetime sale and i think i had probably been a little bit confusing so you can blame me on this i could have been a lot more clear about that one i think that  moves from q mostly to q but also to q but obviously were maintaining our guidance for the year so i think this is really just a difference in phasing again you can blame me its probably my fault i had not been as clear as i could be but as you look at that for q then at  we are up almost  on eps so just if you could take a look at that and if theres any questions im happy to take those now or later in this call but the other thing if i could draw this to your attention that all came from flavor so when q results come out for flavor you will see a decline yearoveryear in operating profit because we will not have that onetime sale again in q of this year that doesnt mean flavor is not doing well that would mean flavors is still very much on track for the year and for the quarter but i just wanted to make sure i was very clear because again i dont think i was as clear as i could have been in the last call or even referencing this last year q brett hundley i appreciate that paul well blame you because you know we sellsiders are infallible of course paul manning i would agree  with that brett hundley of course of course thank you for that paul appreciate it operator our next question comes from francesco pellegrino from sidoti francesco pellegrino so you did know i was on the call and i actually want to continue the conversation about your maintained outlook for the year and i guess the additional transparency into your guidance and what to look for for q was relatively helpful but just to piggyback off of bretts last question about the order timing and product mix which should really benefit the second quarter i was just operating under the assumption that the first half of  youre going to have some greater fx currency headwind and just reading through the release it really didnt seem that way i would think in the second half thats where you start the yearoveryear issues with the stronger us dollar but maybe if you could touch on a little bit if maybe whether it was product mix higher a higher product mix of higher margin products in certain graphical areas or if it was just greater business in certain geographical areas regardless of whatever the product mix was paul manning let me answer the first part so i think its specific to fx and this can be helpful we estimated on the last call in february that we would have a roughly  eps impact just related to fx stephen j rolfs  paul manning  right and so as we look at that now a couple of month two months later if we were to look at the entire year we would say its probably closer to about  now so what that would then spell is that you could see us potentially at the higher end of our eps range but i would say this weve seen these types of movements in the past and so i want to continue to confirm our range because we dont know where the fx may go in even another month or two from now in my opinion weve been very very close on our estimates at least the last three years on this one so  estimate in february we are probably at about  today but i am not  confident at what that rate will be for the year so id like to kind of keep the range there francesco pellegrino if i could just interrupt you for one second and i think you might be getting at the same thing all in all this was a really strong quarter considering the fx headwind just to even report revenue flat yearoveryear and then to just report the eps growth that you did and then to see that the balance of the year  of the  fx is just going to be falling in the next three quarters all else equal and if your assumptions are correct going forward i just want to reiterate like all in all a flat top line this was a very strong quarter outside of some of the fx headwinds that you faced paul manning yes i think i was very pleased with many if not most of the businesses in the top line that they were able to achieve in a local currency measurement francesco pellegrino okay and i guess just one of the other things that i want to hit on and its not something that i usually touch on a lot is i noticed that the balance sheet and i wasnt sure maybe this was due to the asset divestiture but whether its like your trade accounts receivable or its some of your accounts payable are you having like stricter credit terms with customers because your collection turnover period is improving significantly and i just wasnt sure if there was anything behind that paul manning steve loves this kind of stuff let me turn this one over to him here for a minute stephen j rolfs its a good catch francesco so there are two things going on on the receivable line youll recall we did that accounts receivable securitization i think right at the beginning of the fourth quarter last year so that removed about  million of receivables and so when you look at the comparison from march of this year to march of last year you do see them down and a lot of it is that securitization that we did but i would also point out youre right that we were better in collections and so our days even ex that item our days improved a little bit but thats the main difference you see on the balance sheet another thing youll see in some of the other accounts youll see some of those came down and some of those are those assets that were held for sale that paul talked about the savory ingredient facility and the natural ingredients in europe that removed about  million from the balance sheet as well francesco pellegrino okay that makes sense for the improvement in trade accounts receivable and im just obviously trying to think that obviously they are ph going to trickle into cash flow but then why did your trade accounts payable jumped so significantly if we have relatively flat inventory stephen j rolfs so on the payables ill just turn to the balance sheet that youre looking at the main thing going on there is as some of our capital projects related to the restructuring wind down were essentially paying off some of those payables and not replenishing because the capital projects are finishing and not being replaced by others and there are other accruals related to the restructuring that result in some of the liabilities coming down and again its as those activities wind down and thats what youre seeing there paul manning yes and on kind of an annual basis francesco we had a really good cash flow and free cash flow – free cash flow and cash flow from operations in  i would expect to have a very good year in  as well on that so whether were talking about receivables and payables and inventory and then obviously an improvement in operating profit i think if each of these are going to spell very nice improvement in cash flow from ops and then if capex continues to trend in sort of the  million to  million as youll know historically thats a little bit lower than weve been we would pick up some benefit on free cash flow to the business francesco pellegrino right right i just wasnt sure since we were looking at the balance sheet and its a moment in time if this was going to be something that was going to maybe be offset in the second quarter but these seem more like sustainable efficiencies going forward so… stephen j rolfs i think thats right yes francesco pellegrino and i had noticed it in the fourth quarter as well so just to see the sequential benefit continue i guess this is something sustainable going forward okay that was it for me thanks again

ahead sir stephen rolfs thanks good morning im steve rolfs senior vice president and chief financial officer of sensient technologies corporation i would like to welcome all of you to sensients conference call to discuss  second quarter financial results im joined this morning by paul manning sensients chairman president and chief executive officer yesterday we released our  second quarter financial results a copy of the release is now available on our website at sensientcom during our call today we will reference certain nongaap financial measures which we believe provide investors with additional information to evaluate the companys performance and improve the comparability of results between reporting periods these nongaap financial measures remove the impact of restructuring costs currency movements and other costs as noted in the companys filings nongaap financial results should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information calculated in accordance with gaap a reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures is available on the investor information section of our website at sensientcom and in our press release we encourage investors to review these reconciliations in connection with the comments we make this morning i would also like to remind everyone that comments made this morning including responses to your questions may include forwardlooking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of  our statements may be affected by certain factors including risks and uncertainties which are discussed in detail in the companys filings with the securities and exchange commission we urge you to read sensients filings for a description of these factors please bear these factors in mind when you analyze our comments today now well hear from paul manning paul manning thanks steve good morning sensient reported adjusted earnings per share of  in the quarter compared to last year’s second quarter results of  foreign currency translation reduced adjusted eps by  in the first quarter as i noted in prior calls last year’s result included a  benefit for these flavors and fragrances group from a onetime sales import rights and in this year’s second quarter we realized a tax benefit of  removing the impact of these items in both years this year’s second quarter adjusted eps is essentially even with the prior year results obviously this performance does not meet my expectations color had a good quarter but we had a number of operational issues in flavors and fragrances and soft results in asiapacific flavors and fragrances had a disappointing quarter much of which related to winding down of restructuring activities operating income was down by  recall that last year’s second quarter included a  million benefit from the sales of an import rights but the most significant issues this quarter was the impact of restructuring while we completed our restructuring related production moves in june the impact of this transition had a substantial effect on the group’s performance this quarter we experienced production and shipping backlogs which shifted a significant amount of orders into the third quarter we have been reducing the value of the order backlog and we expect to be caught up this quarter as a result of the restructuring delays we also had higher production and logistics costs including overtime temporary labor expedited shipping and additional warehousing costs we will continue to see higher production cost in the shortterm but we expect that plant costs will normalize by the end of the year in addition to the significant restructuring related issues flavors and fragrances also been impacted by other unusual items in the quarter including higher production costs at an additional site lower pricing and lower volumes in aroma chemicals a working capital adjustment and lower volumes from one of our customers in asia ill add more detail on the asia customers in a few minutes it was a very challenging quarter for flavors and fragrances but we still have high expectations for the group we have completed the restructuring program which has been a significant distraction for the last three plus years in addition to the restructuring changes we completed the sale of two businesses earlier this year the divestitures removed operations that did not align with our strategy we are diluted at the groups operating profit margin and increased working capital balances these actions have already improved the groups mix which is reflected in a  basis points improvement in the second quarter gross profit margin and furthermore these changes allow the group to focus on new product development and other initiatives that will drive growth improve the groups product mix and generate higher operating margin asia pacific also had a challenging quarter and local currency revenue was up  and operating income was down significantly on the last call i mentioned that the groups first quarter performance was impacted by order timing and product mix and those issues have continued longer than we originally expected one of our larger customers in the region is implementing a change in its distribution network which has affected their sales and consequently their requirements for our products these lower volumes represent a significant portion of the income variance compared to last years second quarter we expect volumes to normalize once our customer resolves this issue we still see good longterm opportunities for our businesses in asia pacific we have made significant investments in both personnel and facilities in the region to increase our technical capabilities allowing us to work more closely with customers and to sell products that are aligned with the strategies and colors and flavors we recently opened a new production facility and expanded manufacturing capabilities at another site in the region to reduce cost and to shorten lead times expanding our presence in asia pacific is a significant part of our growth strategy and we remain very optimistic about the opportunities in this region color had a good quarter driven by strong results from the cosmetics and north american food colors businesses for the group revenue is up just over  and operating income increased  in local currency the groups operating profit margin increased  basis points to  in the quarter the cosmetics business continues to perform well with strong growth for both revenue and operating income the food colors business in north america reported solid profit growth driven by natural colors our results in latin america were down but we think this is an anomaly because there is a strong interest in natural colors and clean label ingredients our cosmetics business continues to see strong demand for makeup lipstick and other personal care products the end markets for cosmetics have been very strong and we have a robust innovation program which allows us to develop solutions for a wide range of applications including makeup skin and hair care our success in cosmetics remain broad based with growth in every region in the food and beverage markets we expect to see the strong interest in natural colors continue to for some time in the second quarter approximately  of all new product launches in the us features natural colors and this figure is about  globally many of the worlds largest food companies including some of the largest food retailers have announced their intention to use natural colors in their products we expect these conversions to take place over the next few years but to the nearterm conversion activity has been driven by local and regional manufacturers or privatelabel brands sensient is the market leader for food and beverage colors and we have developed proprietary technologies that allow our customers to offer natural products without compromising on the appearance or affecting the taste we are uniquely positioned to lead the conversion to natural colors because of our investments in new technologies and our applications expertise earlier in my comments about flavors and fragrances i noted that we had completed our restructuring activities we stopped production at the last facility in june now we have closed or sold nine major production sites in the last three plus years those facilities were not core to our ongoing strategy by rationalizing our facilities we have lowered our cost structure and reduced our ongoing capital expenditure requirements this very necessary restructuring has been a serious distraction for several years as flavors and fragrances moves on from restructuring we will be able apply more resources to initiatives that will drive growth including new product development we will have some residual restructuring comps for the remainder of the year but they would not be significant with many challenges in the second quarter and while i’m not satisfied with our results i remain confident in our expectations for the businesses for this year and beyond color had another strong quarter and we continue to see strong demand for cosmetic products and natural food colors my expectations for colors has not changed and i still expect color to deliver mid to high singledigit revenue growth and high singledigit profit growth for the year flavor and fragrances has been improving its product mix and will move on from restructuring i expect them to deliver low singledigit profit growth with more than  basis points of margin improvement i have revised my earlier expectations for flavors and fragrances because of the restructuring related issues and the other unusual onetime items that happened in this quarter we are having a temporary setback in asia largely driven by issues at one of our larger customers but we are optimistic about our ability to grow in this region we are revising our adjusted eps guidance to be between  and  for the year which represents mid to high singledigit growth in local currency terms our previous guidance was  to  i remain very optimistic about the company’s future steve will now provide you with additional details on the second quarter results stephen rolfs thank you paul sensient’s operating income was  million in the quarter compared to  million in last year’s second quarter the operating income results include restructuring and other costs of  million in the quarter and  million in the comparable period last year excluding the restructuring and other costs adjusted operating income was  million and  million in the second quarters of  and  respectively foreign currency translation reduced both revenue and adjusted operating income by approximately  in the quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were  in the quarter compared to  in the comparable period last year restructuring and other costs reduced earnings per share by  in this years second quarter and by  in last years second quarter adjusted earnings per share were  in the quarter and  in the comparable period last year foreign currency translation reduced adjusted eps by  per share in the quarter the second quarter results included a  tax benefit which was primarily due to a planning opportunity that was available to us this year we expect the fullyear tax rate to be consistent with last years tax rate corporate costs were down  million in the quarter primarily due to lower performance based compensation and lower professional fees operating income was  million in the first six months of this year and  million in the first six months of  the operating income results include  million and  million of restructuring and other costs in the first half of the  and  respectively so moving the impact of restructuring and other costs adjusted operating income was a  million in the first half of this year and  million in the first six months of  adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was a  in the first six months of  compared to a  in the comparable period last year foreign currency translation reduced revenue adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted earnings per share by approximately  in the first half of this year cash flow from operations was  million in the quarter compared to  million in last years comparable period the second quarter cash flow was reduced by higher working capital balances and higher income tax payments compared to last years result capital expenditures were approximately  million in the quarter and we still expect capital expenditures to be between  million and  million for the year we repurchased approximately  shares during the second quarter our balance sheet remains strong adjusted debt to adjusted ebitda was  at the end of the quarter we plan to keep debt levels in line with an investment grade profile to maintain the flexibility for capital expenditures dividend payments share repurchases and acquisitions we will continue to take a balanced prudent and longterm approach to our capital allocation strategy which includes evaluating share repurchases and acquisitions on an opportunistic basis thank you very much for your time this morning we will now open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator todays questionandanswer session will be conducted electronically operator instructions our first question comes from brett hundley from vertical group brett hundley thank you good morning guys paul you threw a lot at us on the flavor and fragrance side as an explanation and for why results didn’t come in as you had expected and maybe you can go into a little bit more detail on some of those issues i guess at its core what i’m ultimately going to be trying to get at is where do you think flavors and fragrance growth could have been ex some of these items where do you think that segment margins could have been ex some of these items because without the individual details on the things that you brought up i look at your segment performance and i kind of back out what i think is a calling effect i back out what i think is a forex ph impact or what you gave us as a forex impact and that kind of implies flat organic growth at best for your flavors fragrance division and then when i look at your margin for the division clearly it was about flat sequentially flat yearonyear when you make some adjustments and you have been talking about this kind of  basis points plus improvement in segment margins for the course of this year and it sounds like your moderating that somewhat because of the issues that you brought up so that said its heart what i’m trying to get out and i was wondering if you could just go into more detail on the issues that you brought up and when we might be able to see some of them clear up paul manning okay sure let me go through those items for you brett so getting right to it i would tell you that if we were to get at the heart of your question what were the results without these items i would tell you that if i would add up the profit impact of these onetime items that i featured in the opening monologue there we would had been up about mid singledigit profit growth essentially consistent with where i thought we were going to be each quarter of this year revenue was obviously also impacted by the back order situation as well as the fx pieces this is only about a percentage this quarter and then you got a couple of percentages related to the divestiture of those other businesses so net net assuming none of these factors that i addressed in the opening monologue had been in play we would have expected the operating profit to be up certainly mid singledigit and perhaps to say in the range of say  to  revenue would have been a lot closer to flat and then the operating profit margin would have also been up obviously in excess of that  basis points that i had guided to in the beginning of the year so if you kind of separate what are we doing externally versus what is happening internally when i gave the guidance for flavors and colors in asia for  it was based on what we felt we could win in the market what cost we were going to take out and so that was why we certainly formulated the original guidance to you and as we talk specifically now about flavors it was mid singledigit and perhaps even high singledigit on profit to with flat on revenue owing to the culling in some of the fx but that was where we were guiding as you look at the second half that guidance still applies that is ultimately what we believe we are still able to achieve externally now i think you would anticipate q or q lets just say the back half has being sequentially much better than q for flavors and much more consistent with the results that you saw in q so i think we would get back on track with the op margin growth being  plus basis points for the back half i think you will see revenue closer to that flat that we had suggested  where i suggested was the forecast for the year and i think we would be back in that ballpark of certainly mid singledigit growth on op for the back half for flavors so kind of underlining all of this is i think the nature of these things i emphasize that there is a difference between what is happening internally what is happening externally i think externally this restructuring issue aside we continue to make very good progress on our program on our strategy throughout much of the flavors and fragrances group i think putting this restructuring behind us is going to be a tremendous benefit as you can imagine after three plus years of this this gets a little bit tiring to everybody but obviously we didnt execute in q and im very disappointed with that but i would tell you that the nature of it was very much internal rather than external factors which would suggest that either we couldnt compete or we couldnt overcome obstacles in the market and thats not the case brett hundley i appreciate that i mean this question maybe a little late or it may not even have much relevance at this point but looking back do you think that you guys would have benefited from maybe more outside help as it relates to going through the restructuring and even the aftermath of the restructuring i know this is in your first rodeo as it relates to these things but was this one more complex than you thought and even as you look forward are there lingering issues potentially where having some outside help to manage your way through and allowing the senior managers of the company to focus on areas of growth strategy et cetera makes more sense paul manning well i would say at this point its somewhat academic and as much as restructuring is done from the standpoint of consolidating plants and moving products these are not easy things and fortunately i havent really had to talk much about the interworking of restructuring we have been able to overcome many of these things but came at the very end why this one because i think you said it very well this is a far more complex move to some degree thats why it was held towards the end but i think in general as we move forward i dont really need to use the word restructuring because from an operational standpoint we have now closed that last plant and its just a matter of when we sell that facility its gone forever but we have effectively sold every other facility at this point we are out of them and we are really talking about growing beyond this some of the other regions where we also restructured and again its never easy its not like consolidating two widget plants into the one widget plant you just continue to build its certainly been far more complex than that but we have shown and demonstrated in these other regions that have sort of moved past restructuring that once we get to that phase its a very different game and we can compete very effectively in the marketplace and we are generating wins where we believe we can and i think you will expect and you should expect to see much of the same coming out these two us businesses that were affected by restructuring here brett hundley just two others for me on colors the margin was very solid again and exceeded my expectation the top line performance was a little bit disappointing to me when i just think about the backdrop for a number of difference business lines that you have there and even one of your competitors has continue to put up pretty good results on tough comparisons and so the growth that you guys saw in that business was a little bit disappointing to me you mentioned latam as a potential effect there but i was wondering if you could just talk about that business a little bit more and the expectations you have internally do you believe that you are seeing any share of degradation in certain areas just a bit more help there would be helpful paul manning sure so our guidance for color at the start of the year was mid singledigit top line high singledigit op but it’s still the guidance with the color group for the year part of that guidance is also could there be some uplift in operating profit margin yes but i didn’t commit to some significant movement in that because as you we already noted its quite good if i were to breakdown those businesses in general i think cosmetics had an outstanding quarter again this is continuing in their program over the last couple of years a very strong results top line and bottom line pharma business had very good top line growth as well i think ultimately getting to with natural colors natural colors has been a significant uplift in this business for the last several years and our results continue to be good now something that was somewhat relevant to the second quarter was essentially the pace of new product launches in the us and north america in particular but even on a global basis if you look at kind of yeartodate  new product development launches are down  in the north american market globally its down  to  so that certainly can have an impact but certainly that affects us and a lot of other people in this market think when you look at some of our core business where we have a lot of synthetic color business that’s one picture but when you look at the natural color business that’ s very different picture clearly synthetic colors by design are going to be flat and perhaps even on the decline as we convert customers to natural colors but to get to your real point are we winning in this market i would tell you that indeed we are when you consider the various spectrums of products in the market from the innovative and the very sophisticated products to the more mundane building blocks we certainly win and have an outsize advantage i would argue on the more innovative products that provide much more closer to synthetic color matches than you are seeing right now in the market on some of these building blocks and an important thing to think about is natural colors companies that can convert to natural colors there is two ways to do this in my opinion correctly or incorrectly the correct way would define the closest match to a synthetic and for those companies that have done so we have very detailed iri data that tell you that those brands are growing those categories are growing for those who would elect to take the building block kind of the more muted not good matches to synthetic colors those brands are being negatively impacted from that so not only they have the negative impact to the economics by converting to synthetic to natural but they also have been negative because they didnt do it on a likeforlike basis and consumers are rejecting these products that dont offer a comparable visual appearance to the synthetic alternative so we continue to focus on that part of the market we continue to focus on those opportunities and i feel very good about that natural color business and colors in general right now we are up about midsingle a little bit lower end of that for top line for the year but i feel very good about maintaining that guidance and that expectation for the year certainly to get to that natural colors would have to be above that expectation because we have the big synthetic business that is essentially below that expectation so i dont if all that makes sense but i just wanted to give you that kind of color to the whole thing brett hundley it does i appreciate the thoughts and i’ll stop there and leave the floor thank you paul manning okay thanks brett operator and our next question comes from the line of curt siegmeyer from keybanc capital markets curt siegmeyer just a followup on flavors you mentioned low singledigit up income expectations for the fullyear and given where we are sort of yeartodate kind of down high singledigit range it seems to imply obviously up high singledigit in the second half and i know there would be a point or two of that fx in there but i guess the question is just how confident are you that sort of how the second half will unfold and do you expect any lingering effects in the third quarter now that the restructuring is behind you or do you anticipate a pretty rapid improvement in terms of sort of volumes and some of the inefficiencies kind of going away that you have been dealing with paul manning so to begin your math is about right and i would tell you that number two im very confident and im very confident because im already seeing what we are selling in july and im seeing what our orders in august look like and its a picture that allows us to achieve those financial results that i just alluded to i think with respect to these residual costs i dont want to get into accounting romance here but obviously some of these things bleed over into a quarter which is obviously dependent on your inventory levels but needless to say some of those costs will bleed into q but i believe we can rapidly remove and continue to remove those costs post in this post restructuring phase that we are in so in short i feel very comfortable about this the reason that i felt comfortable with our guidance is again because i see the path we are on and i see the results and i see the q event effectively being an internal issue and an internal issue that we now address and have overcome and in some cases because they were onetime they are not repeating i feel very good about the prospects in q and q curt siegmeyer okay great and then just one on the guidance given that you kept your colors outlook roughly the same and maybe tweak down flavors a little bit given what you have already seen over the first six months the low end of eps guidance raised  is it all due to less fx headwind is there a little bit of a benefit from maybe a lower tax rate for the fullyear or maybe if you can just sort of talk about that paul manning so i’ll answer the second part of your questions first we expect tax to be about the same as it was in  as it will be in  so think about tax in essence as a timing issue with respect to your fx comment yes i think in the beginning of the year we anticipated and we had projected fx will be about  impact we are looking more like it’s about half that and depending as my crystal ball here tells me that maybe about right for the year but we will continue and potentially revise again if rates would move and provide more of a tailwind for us but yes i think fx had a big part of raising the lower end of that guidance curt siegmeyer great thanks a lot paul paul manning okay thanks curt operator and our next question comes from the line francesco pellegrino from sidoti capital francesco pellegrino good morning guys so just to understand the flavors and fragrances topic and to be honest with you i think it all sort of like boils down to how big are these back orders that are sort of going to be in this third quarter because you talked a lot about higher costs sort of persisting into the third quarter but i would think you would have a gotten a little bit more operating leverage in this second half of the year these back orders are of any significant size i was just wondering if you could give a little bit of color in the flavors and fragrances segment on that end paul manning sure i’ll say this so number one when we close the other facility a whole bunch of costs come out as a result of that so i think that’s already as we declared in my opening monologue that happen in june i think a lot of the other costs associated with expediting orders and making sure that production levels are correct and that things are working more seamlessly this is something that  again much of this happens and will continue to happen right now and as we continue into three and in the fourth quarter as well so i think these costs are very much in our control to take them out because again they were precipitated at the onset of restructuring prior to that this was actually a very well run efficient lower costs plant in the whole company so i have got a lot of confidence that with the new products that we have introduced an the new volumes that we have introduced that that’s going to be something very much in our control to take those costs out and continue to commit to the savings that we had pledged with respected to the restructuring savings we haven’t necessarily talked about those on this call but we have certainly more nominal savings for  but those savings we expect to generate are still there and they will be something that we work towards internally and communicate externally as we get into the tail end of  and more like into  those savings are still well with the rest of the generating from the closure of this site backlog again i think as i look at our progress there certainly we see the end is very much insight and it’s in q and i just want to certainly be very clear about that but i think the longer your operating this facility the more efficient you become the more successful you become and this is essentially what i have been seeing it gives me a lot of confidence that we address these issues get through this backlog and move on francesco pellegrino okay let me ask you maybe the same question in a different way just to help us with some  how the sale sites are really you are thinking about maybe next year as well i know you are a couple of quarters away from giving  guidance so ill approach this very carefully when we think about just the strong margin profile that we are probably going to be seeing in the flavors and fragrances in the second half im a little bit concerned about how i should sort of take the second half and view what should be happening in  how sustainable is the line of the margin growth thats going to be happening in the second half of  and then sort of rolling that into  giving just all a different moving pieces that we have been seeing so far paul manning well listen i pledged to our shareholders that we are on the road to  operating profit margin in flavors and so that is very much still within our sights we still have a significant number of our businesses that have demonstrated tremendous improvement and operating profit margin prior to this quarter we have been talking about that for about the last year and a half the very strong progress we have made on operating profit margin so i think that continues to be a very realistic goal for us and you throw out the rest of these costs post restructuring we continue to emphasize selling the products consistent with our strategy continuing to focus on moving away from the lower margin less competitive products and so i think these still provide us with a path to the eventual of  op margin that i would anticipate communicating here and our progress towards that throughout  and  so the upside is there and ultimately once we get past cost then really the uplift will come principally from product mix and i think those are very consistent with where we have suggested from the very beginning with a three or four pillars as to how we get to that  op margin francesco pellegrino okay in each of the segments i know for flavors and fragrances in asia pacific you cited the decline in bonds is there a way to sort of quantify the volume declines in each of the segments just so we can sort of like better understand what is happening with pricing in the segments while also obviously being cognizant of on shift in the product mix i dont know if you have those numbers handy stephen rolfs so francisco generally i would say since we have been moving price up in the flavor business so pricing would be a matter of favorable and volume would account for a little bit more than the reported revenue change then in asia most of the decline you see would be volume related i would say francesco pellegrino okay and let me push back a little bit if colors group was basically flat yearoveryear and price point for color on a per unit basis are higher are volume sales in the color group lower a little lower than the same quarter stephen rolfs so the comment that i just gave around flavor in asia francesco pellegrino right so i guess just digging a little bit into the color group then stephen rolfs so in terms of color we would have seen favorable volume growth on food and beverage colors primarily our natural colors offset slightly by synthetic colors cosmetic was very strong on volume and those would be the key drivers in the quarter francesco pellegrino okay that make sense and so i guess maybe just looking at it a different way and this is my last question in regards to your eps growth is there may be a way to sort of quantify what you guys might be looking for on a consolidated basis for operating income growth so we can sort of just like back out from some of the moving pieces like share buybacks the tax rate paul manning so are you talking for  or  francesco francesco pellegrino  it seems your guidance imply for operating income growth guidance paul manning so it would implied mid to mid singledigit growth francesco pellegrino okay mid singledigit okay perfect that’s it for me thanks again paul manning okay thanks operator and our next question comes from the line andrew lane from morningstar andrew lane hi good morning so with the restructuring program now completed i wanted to ask you to take a step back and comment on some key takeaways from a bigger picture prospective so when reorganizing and combining your operational footprint were there any aspects that you didn’t anticipate that perhaps by surprise ended up being highly valuable and it maybe led to improved efficiency for your ongoing facilities paul manning well i suppose one day i would i guess with restructuring it’s the very nature of the program you anticipate a lot of things you plan for a lot of things but they are very challenging and like i said i can’t tell you how excited i am about restructuring being over but i think you can’t underestimate despite the fact that you make a product in one production facility when you move it it doesn’t necessarily do to same things that it did in the last facility why any number of factors might have changed the operating environment the utility support all of these factors could come into play i think that when you are talking about a specialty chemical versus the fine chemical there can often be a lot of variability in raw materials and variability in operating conditions but again lend itself to a very complex transition of a product you are talking about transferring individuals or training new individuals as well can certainly ad to the complexity and then as you are doing this you are also in some cases trying to rationalize into improved formulations to take out costs formulations to simplify the supply chain requirements for any given product so there is a whole host of things that can go right and things that can go wrong a lot obviously did not go right in this last one but a lot has gone right in the earlier ones because again i haven’t really been talking about this kind of stuff until now so yes if i can get into my time machine and go back sure there are some things that i would do differently here to affect the outcome and to improve the outcome but i think at this point it’s really a matter of how do we expedite the removal of these costs and these plants and work on improving throughput and other efficiencies in these so that we can get to where we really wanted to go restructuring was an absolutely essential and necessary step that the flavor needed to take to not only take out cost but to take out complexity operating a lot of plants becomes a very complex game to go and trying to staph ph all those plants the capital expenditures requirements grow considerably when you have more plants and so these things are all very essential and i think longterm we are going to be veryvery pleased that we went through this painful process of restructuring andrew lane all right fantastic thanks changing gears to your rd spend i wanted to touch base on that quickly here it was up a bit to about  as a percent of sales in  after kind of being a  to  over the last decade some of your larger competitors have high singledigit rd spend as a percent of sales particularly now with restructuring in the rear view mirror do you have a specific target for sensing it into the future on this line item paul manning yes my target is about measuring outcome not measuring effort and so from that standpoint each of the businesses is evaluated on their ability or their top line growth that’s generated from new product development so that would be comment number one certainly for some of our businesses we assign a    top line growth expectation out of new product development with the assumption that you have some products out in the market that go away or the customer cant indiscernible and you have some that you are also adding that are not considered new products as there are more standard products so i would say thats comment number one number two a lot of this depends on how you define rd we dont necessarily say anybody wearing a white lab coat constitutes rd spend we are fairly purist when it comes to who is actually doing real rd rather than who is just in a lab so i cant speak to my competitors because im not necessarily intimately familiar with their process for measuring this but i can tell you for our process we are very strict and very rigid with how we measure the actual spend but ultimately your question is driving at are we spending enough in this area i think in the majority of our businesses we are but there is certainly more opportunities particularly in asia pacific to continue to enhance our investments there that we can drive the better outcome from new products but there is always opportunity in every business and so a lot of this is about picking the right products too there is a lot of blue sky stuff that a company could do but sometimes you got to focus on what customers actually want and they are going to buy and they will talk to you about being committed to buying so those are some of the metrics that we look at very closely on that one andrew lane all right i appreciate the insight thanks i’ll turn it back over paul manning sure operator and our next question comes from garo norian from telese capital management garo norian hey guys first question i had just on the asia situation that customer there i guess you went through the flavor and fragrances side and kind of got a lot more confident that that was internal and more shorter term lives i mean what is the right way of thinking about how asia is likely to play out over the next couple of quarters paul manning well ill be a little bit deductive in my answer here well actually let me be inductive first asia is going to have a very good  so that is a longer term answer i think right now its just a matter of timing on some of what i mentioned in the monologue i think as you look at those asia pacific regionbyregion i think we feel very good about a number of our regions like the oceania region we feel very good we feel very good about parts of north asia we feel very good about part of southeast asia but i think each one of these areas has different challenges associated with them and some of our challenges right now are what i had mentioned there but a lot of this too is how do you continue to identify the opportunities i mean asia in general is a far more fragmented market than you are going to see in the us or europe so there is a lot more players there is a lot more opportunities for a company like sensient to be successful there is not as much of the strangle hold on the market that you see in some of the other parts of the world that we are dealing in so the opportunities are there and certainly the focus is there and i have very strong expectations for asiapacific certain in   is harder to break i got to be completely frankly beyond that one because it’s not necessarily within my control nevertheless i think that it’s a good market it’s a good market for our products and there is a growing interest in our products whether they are cosmetics or inks or flavors or fruit colors lot of the same trends we are seeing in the americas and europe whether its natural colors or extracts or digital inks or very sophisticated cosmetic products that entire market is a prime opportunity for sensient garo norian got it great and then related to some of that you had mentioned earlier on the color side it’s sort of these customers that might have switch to natural with what is color a lower quality task has any of them already started to come around and talked about going to the higher quality way of doing things paul manning yes is the short answer there i think there is a little bit of a different model at play in general you would see products in europe tend to not have the same level of vividness as a us based products but in the us market it is never been demonstrated that that type of what i call white wash color on some products works with the consumer particularly consumer who has been acclimated to products that are very bright and vivid and in that person’s mind can act very strongly what the flavor of that products and what tends to happen interestingly enough and what often times will drive customers to make these changes in their colors is the end consumer has decided that the product no longer taste the same it used to be really red now it’s like light red well they taste different like i they like the taste any more and on one level you could say well of course it taste the same but there is a such a strong connection between the visual color and the flavor outcome that this is what has driven many of these customers who are experimenting with the nonmatching solutions driven them to rethink that solution but i can’t speak for every customer out there garo norian got it thanks and some more technical questions working capital through the second half of the year i mean obviously there was a big use in the first half what is expectation for the second half stephen rolfs sure so in the first half there were really two theme on working capital the cosmetic business which has been very strong performing very well we see higher inventories and receivables there and that has extracted then on the flavor side some of the impacts for restructuring have impacted working capital and so we saw a negative usage there and we would expect that to work its way out in the second half of the year the only other thing would be in our natural ingredients business we have seen some higher inventories there but thats somewhat by design every few years you wind up with a crop issue and so we would rather be long and have the product to sell there so i think the restructuring items should begin to work their way out in the second half garo norian okay so just im thinking about things for the fullyear i mean we shouldnt be going higher than what we have used up already through the first half is that kind of a logical way of thinking stephen rolfs yes i think thats right garo norian okay and then just lastly my model for the tax rate last year was about  is that where we are ball parking stephen rolfs for the second half of the year yes thats about right paul manning no for the fullyear garo norian for the fullyear stephen rolfs yes so both of those statements are right so it will be about  for the second half and that will bring us to that rate for the year garo norian got it perfect thanks so much paul manning thanks garo operator our next question comes from the line of mike sison from keybanc michael sison hey guys paul when you think about flavors you spent a couple of years now trying to transition this portfolio into more solution type of applications versus ingredients and could you maybe just update us on the progress by subsegment meaning the savory there is dairy if you think each of the segments are you almost where you want to be in terms of what you are offering to your clients as you head into    paul manning as you look at the spectrum by segment you could say that where we are closest to that and where we are furthest from that closest i would tell you is beverage and fragrances furthest from that would be savory flavors and in the middle would be sweet flavors and i think some of that is the size of the legacy business so in other words savory had a lot of ingredient sales sweet flavors had a lot of ingredient sales and by that i mean fruit preps beverage had fewer of those so it was a little bit more of a historical model that kind of i think set the trajectory moving forward but i would tell you that in each case and we are making very good progress on this just a little bit of a further put ph on some of them and then again when you have core business that makes it a little bit longer term in terms of actually moving the op margin in those individual business units but i think certainly overall we see the opportunities to sell these products they are far more defensible and i think again it goes back to the types of customers we are focusing on in the market nobody has asked this question but certainly there is some big companies out there that have had some not particularly good q results as they have mentioned publicly already but you will notice that in the business like color where we have really set out for several years now to diversify our customer base we can handle those types of declines and still grow the business i think flavor is because it wasnt necessarily strongly aligned with those really big customers on flavors but the outset of all this is going to be a very good position as we continue the pursuit of these b and c customers because fundamentally those are the folks who are growing those are the folks who are launching products and they are not necessarily holding back on that front so i think we are aligned with more and more the right customers and that’s going to certainly be a key part of this as well michael sison right and then in terms of the areas that you know you are not as advanced as the others are there opportunities even if you have to pay a little bit more of a premium in acquisitions to sort of jump start that move to more solutions paul manning yes i leave with a one word to answer mike yes michael sison okay great thank you paul manning okay thanks operator and our next question is from christopher perrella from bloomberg intelligence christopher perrella good morning a quick question on cadences of earnings in the second half for the year with the hangover pause into the third quarter should eps being more balanced across the two quarters in the back half for the year than you have seen in the past paul manning to some degree there is obviously seasonality in the business our stronger quarters tend to be q and q which as you see last year we are pretty consistent with one another and of course q and q sometimes in fact typically q is a little bit bigger than q but that has historically not always been the case so i would tell you that in general as you look at the business historically q and q tend to mere each other or be very close to each other now i mentioned a lot of these onetime items in q so make sure you are taking that into account but q would be certainly not as strong as q or q and a lot closer to say q outcome christopher perrella okay and then the gross margin how should i think about raw material cost pressure and your ability to offset that with new products or with some pricing stephen rolfs so we have generally been very successful at offsetting that with pricing the other thing to keep in mind is that we have so many different raw materials that there are always things moving in different directions so you might hear about pressure on one particular ingredient but then we are going to have others that are going in the other way so there aren’t necessarily any trends out there right now that i think are going to be a problem for us it should be a fairly stable environment in terms of our ability to offsetting anything that happens christopher perrella okay that was it just for me thank you very much stephen rolfs thank you chris paul manning yes thanks chris operator and we have reached the end of the questionandanswer session please contact the company with any additional questions at this time i will turn
