count by  cfo valerie baugher stated we currently have  shares outstanding and  shares in the float  we are finishing up our first harvest and based on the results we feel confident that over the long term our outstanding share count should settle somewhere between where it is now and  shares  that being the case we are immediately reducing our authorized share count to an even  shares  by second or third quarter of  we fully expect existing profits to fund further expansion over and above the planned expansion outlined in our previous press release  at that time we may look at a further reduction in the authorized number as a show of good faith that we are serious about our long term commitment to shareholders ceo tj magallanes stated as ive stated in the past the best way that i can ensure shareholders are confident in their investment is to stay  focused on the business itself as we move toward expansion  with a planned k square feet of grow space in the works a conservative  in revenue per square foot projected and now a stable and reasonable share structure we hope that weve done our part at least in the short term to ensure that investors see the value in what we are

calif july   prnewswire  sunset island group inc otcqb sigo announced today that it is in the process of harvesting its first  square feet of grow space and that the entire run has already been presold to a cannabis supplier in southern california ceo tj magallanes stated this is our first real opportunity to share our plan with the investment community so lets get into some of the detail  first we are set up for year round harvesting  we have staggered growth in our initial grow space in such a way that we should remain in a constant state of harvest  a company like ours that has product available year round is an attractive resource for dispensaries across the state  we have an excellent experienced staff including security and our team is committed to a methodical but aggressive build out of the business over time  we are looking to scale up in the coming months by securing an additional  square feet of grow space and project a combined  square feet of grow space after our next expansion phase is completed  total greenhouse space with this first expansion should reach k as processing and manufacturing space is required as well for drying trimming etc mr magallanes went on to say our operation is projected to generate a conservative  annually per square foot of grow space over time  in the short term we are selling our first several harvests at a slight discount compared to our competitors in order to build name recognition and goodwill  grow space across the state is at a premium due to demand so we plan to execute long term leases as part of the expansion  several agricultural industries abandoned existing greenhouse space over the past decade and the state and local governments require the use of existing space even those requiring retrofit before any new grow space is built  we were able to build out our first facility at a reasonable price and expect to be able to do the same with the expansion mr magallanes finished up with i am very proud of our team and we are excited about our coming expansion plans  this first harvest has been a learning experience for all of us and were already seeing ways that we can ensure improvements and increase our yield with each harvest to come  i am focused  on the business end of things and that will always be the case but we had a few questions recently about our share structure so let me address those questions at this time  we have no convertible debt and the debt currently on the books is the initial seed capital and that will be reduced in increments over time as the providers of that seed capital will be taking a small percentage of profits with each harvest  we currently have a little over m shares outstanding as indicated at otcmarketscom and we have a little over m in the float the other m shares are owned by me and our president  we have an s registration in the works that could increase the outstanding share count to as much as m but from there we do not anticipate adding any additional shares to the mix as existing profits will be used for additional expansion over and above whats been discussed in this release  i hope that is helpful when making your decision on whether to invest in our company  we look forward to sharing additional updates in the near future notice regarding forwardlooking statements in this press release which are
