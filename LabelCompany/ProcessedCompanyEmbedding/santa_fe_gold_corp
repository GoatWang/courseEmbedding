silver concentrate under  contract with german smelter jan   us equity news  santa fe gold corporation otcbb sfeg is pleased to announce it has shipped  tons of gold and silver concentrate under the sales contract with aurubis ag that was announced december   the  ton shipment is valued at over  million and represents the initial delivery against  tons contracted for delivery in  the contract with aurubis ag europes largest copper and precious metals smelter will provide a sales outlet for a portion of the companys anticipated  production of highvalue precious metals concentrate the sales agreement was reached following a successful smelting trial of an initial  tons of concentrate shipped to aurubus ag in october  the companys lordsburg flotation mill is producing gold and silver concentrate from its summit mine located in southwest new mexico we are pleased to have begun shipments of concentrate under the  aurubis ag sales agreement which we consider to be a very favourable agreement said pierce carson president and chief executive officer we expect this initial shipment will be followed by ongoing regular shipments of concentrate produced from the summit mine we also anticipate being in a position shortly to announce an agreement with an arizona smelter for sales of siliceous flux material our strategy is to establish sales of both concentrate and siliceous flux which will enable us to develop multiple customer outlets and revenue streams production from the summit mine is expected to increase in tonnage and grade and to reach full steady production in  operations at the mine have been accelerated to two hour shifts seven days a week summit ore reserves average  ounces per ton gold and  ounces per ton silver  ounces per ton gold equivalent at full production operating costs are projected to be  per ounce of gold equivalent produced  santa fe gold enters into contract to sell siliceous flux to arizona smelter for precious metals recovery jan   business wire  santa fe gold corporation otcbb sfeg is pleased to announce it has contracted with asarco llc “asarco” to sell  tons of siliceous flux material for delivery during  at recent gold and silver prices the contract is valued at up to  million the siliceous flux will be shipped to asarco’s smelter in hayden ariz the flux material will be processed for precious metals recovery santa fe will be paid for the contained silver and gold less customary charges the sales agreement was reached following a successful smelting trial of an initial  tons of siliceous flux shipped to asarco in  sale of siliceous flux material involves direct shipment of ore with only minimal processing required “we are pleased to have reached this agreement with asarco for sale of siliceous flux material” said pierce carson president and chief executive officer “we also have conducted successful flux trials with another arizona smelter freeportmcmoran miami inc “fm miami” and are discussing a longterm sales agreement we believe that sales of flux to asarco and fm miami could be quite significant to santa fe and eventually could account for a substantial portion of ore mined at summit “the asarco flux contract covering a portion of summit’s anticipated production fits with our strategy of establishing sales of both siliceous flux and concentrate this strategy will enable santa fe to develop multiple customer outlets and multiple revenue streams we recently announced an agreement to sell concentrates to a european smelter “smelter flux sales also add another dimension to our strategy of expanding santa fe’s production profile by processing other ores from the lordsburg area utilizing our excess milling capacity among other potential advantages material sold as smelter flux does not have to be milled and therefore frees even more capacity at our lordsburg mill” the summit mine is ramping up production and is expected to reach full steady production during  revenues are expected to increase significantly over the course of  reflecting increases in both tonnage and grades at full production annual revenues are estimated as approximately  million at recent gold and silver prices operating costs are projected to be  per ounce of gold equivalent produced ore reserves average  ounces per ton gold and  ounces per ton silver  ounces per ton gold equivalent  santa fe gold heads for full production at the summit goldsilver mine nov   business wire  santa fe gold corporation otcbb sfeg today provided an update on the status of its summit goldsilver mine in southwest new mexico processing operations began at the lordsburg mill in april  the summit mine is on track to reach full steady production in  from ore averaging  ounces per ton gold and  ounces per ton silver  ounces per ton gold equivalent operating costs at full production are estimated as  per ounce of gold equivalent produced recently a new internal ventilation shaft was completed and is being equipped with an upgraded fan system this central ventilation shaft which is  ft in length and  ft in diameter will be extended as deeper levels of the mine are reached the improved ventilation will allow summit to operate additional equipment underground which the company is purchasing it also will enable additional shifts to be added operations are planned to be expanded to two hour shifts seven days a week additional engineering and management personnel also have been employed underground work remains focussed on two objectives firstly advancement of headings for overall mine development and secondly mining of two southern ore bodies full production at a rate of  tons per day is expected to be achieved in  upon reaching the northern larger and higher grade ore bodies that constitute the majority of summit’s gold and silver reserves revenues are projected to increase significantly over the next several months reflecting increases in both tonnage and grades santa fe is pursuing a strategy of developing multiple revenue streams from smelter sales of its products including sales of precious metals concentrates and sales of ore as siliceous flux a large european smelter is nearing completion of its evaluation of a trial shipment of  tons of concentrate with the possible outcome of a long term contact the company also has agreed terms and is finalizing a contract for concentrate sales to another overseas smelter beginning with an initial shipment of  tons sales of flux material have continued to two arizona smelters santa fe has agreed terms with one of the arizona smelters on a long term contract for flux sales beginning in january  commenting on the outlook for santa fe in  ceo pierce carson said “we believe that a combination of actions if properly timed and executed could lead to much wider market recognition for santa fe’s value proposition in this exciting gold and silver market our priorities include obtaining a listing on the amex and toronto stock exchanges bringing summit into full production with generation of substantial cash flows and completing the columbus silver acquisition “during the coming year the positive impact and added value of the columbus silver acquisition will become much clearer closing is expected to occur in q  the acquisition will result in a substantial increase in santa fe’s gold and silver resources and will add tremendous exploration upside also importantly gold and silver resources derived from columbus silver properties potentially could be processed at the lordsburg mill possibly doubling the production from summit we believe  could be a pivotal year for santa fe and its stockholders”   sfeg current price volume bid ask days range sfeg detailed quote dmmmmyyyy post new msg follow board my
