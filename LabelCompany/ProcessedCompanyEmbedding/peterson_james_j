this page continue reading the main story like most authors james patterson started out with one book released in  that he struggled to get published it sold about  copies a modest if respectable showing for a first novel last year an estimated  million copies of his books in  different languages found their way onto beach blankets airplanes and nightstands around the world patterson may lack the name recognition of a stephen king a john grisham or a dan brown but he outsells them all really it’s not even close according to nielsen bookscan grisham’s king’s and brown’s combined us sales in recent years still don’t match patterson’s this is partly because patterson is so prolific with the help of his stable of coauthors he published nine original hardcover books in  and will publish at least nine more in there are many different ways to catalog patterson’s staggering success here are just a few since  one out of every  novels bought in the united states was written by james patterson he is listed in the latest edition of “guinness world records” published last fall as the author with the most new york times best sellers  but that number is already out of date he now has  —  of which went to no patterson and his publisher little brown  co a division of the hachette book group have an unconventional relationship in addition to his two editors patterson has three fulltime hachette employees plus assistants devoted exclusively to him a socalled brand manager who shepherds patterson’s adult books through the production process a marketing director for his youngadult titles and a sales manager for all his books despite this support staff and his prodigious output patterson is intimately involved in the publication of his books a former ad executive — patterson ran j walter thompson’s north american branch before becoming a fulltime writer in  — he handles all of his own advertising and closely monitors just about every other step of the publication process from the design of his jackets to the timing of his books’ release to their placement in stores “jim is at the very least copublisher of his own books” michael pietsch patterson’s editor and the publisher of little brown told mea couple of months ago i sat in on one of patterson’s regular meetings with little brown to discuss the marketing and publicity for his coming titles the meeting was held not as you might expect at the publisher’s offices in midtown manhattan but in the living room of patterson’s palm beach home a canary yellow spanishstyle house on a small island in lake worth patterson’s wife sue a tall athleticlooking blonde whom he met at j walter thompson served coffee and gooey chocolatechip cookies to the guests pietsch megan tingley the publisher of little brown’s youngreaders books and david young the ceo of hachette advertisement continue reading the main story pietsch and tingley showed mockups of covers and presented ideas they had been working on from the plush caramelcolored couch facing them patterson who is a trim  with a habitual slouch and laconic manner well suited to his dry sense of humor acted as creative director a familiar role from his years in advertising at one point the conversation turned to the next installment in patterson’s michael bennett series which revolves around a manhattan homicide detective and widower with  multiracial adopted children “cheaper by the dozen” meets “die hard” as patterson describes it pietsch mentioned a possible promotional line “new york has a new hero” patterson instantly amended it “finally new york has a hero” continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story a number of former little brown employees who attended these sorts of meetings with patterson in the s and early s described him to me as lowkey but intimidating more cutthroat adman than retiring writer — a kind of reallife don draper unsatisfied with publishing’s informal approach to marketing meetings patterson had expected corporatestyle presentations complete with comprehensive marketshare data and sales trends “a lot of authors are just grateful to be published” holly parmelee patterson’s publicist from  to  told me several weeks earlier “not jim his attitude was that we were in business together and he wanted us both to succeed but it was not going to be fun and games”but that was when patterson was still making a name for himself and fighting for his publisher’s full attention now that he is the world’s bestselling author and little brown’s most prized possession patterson seemed agreeable easygoing even when he shot down an idea like pietsch’s suggestion that patterson promote the new michael bennett book with a day of events in all five boroughs he did so gently “i just don’t want for it to be like one of those things when an athlete goes through and shakes four hands” halfway through the meeting patterson suggested that they take a short break to listen to some songs from a musical he’s developing based on his romance novel “sundays at tiffany’s”when the meeting was over patterson and his wife drove everyone to lunch in their matching mercedes sedans on our way to the restaurant they took us past their future home an oceanfront mansion in palm beach that they bought last year for  million and are now in the midst of renovating “there’s my little cottage” patterson said as the squarefoot house came into viewaccording to forbes magazine patterson earned hachette about  million over the last two years hachette disputes the accuracy of these numbers but wouldn’t provide me with different ones regardless it seems safe to assume that patterson who puts out more best sellers in any given year than many publishing houses is responsible for a meaningful portion of the company’s annual revenues “i like to say that jim is the rock on which we build this company” david young told me in his office one recent morninglike movie studios publishing houses have long built their businesses on top of blockbusters but never in the history of publishing has the blockbuster been so big thirty years ago the industry defined a “hit” novel as a book that sold a couple of hundred thousand copies in hardcover today a book isn’t considered a blockbuster unless it sells at least one million copiesthe story of the blockbuster’s explosion is paradoxically bound up with that of publishing’s recent troubles they each began with the wave of consolidation that swept through the industry in the s unsatisfied with publishing’s small margins the new conglomerates that now owned the various publishing houses pressed for bigger best sellers and larger profits massmarket fiction had historically been a paperback business but publishers now put more energy and resources into selling these same books as hardcovers with their vastly more favorable profit margins at the same time large stores like barnes  noble and borders were elbowing out independent booksellers their growing dominance of the market gave them the leverage to demand wholesale discounts and charge hefty sums for favorable store placement forcing publishers to sell still more books bigbox stores like costco accelerated the trend by stocking large quantities of books by a small group of authors and offering steep discounts on them under pressure from both their parent companies and booksellers publishers became less and less willing to gamble on undiscovered talent and more inclined to hoard their resources for their most bankable authors the effect was selffulfilling the few books that publishers invested heavily in sold most of the rest didn’t and the blockbuster became even biggerpatterson has been a beneficiary of the industry’s shifting economics but he was also a catalyst for change at little brown and in the world of publishing in general when patterson published his breakout book “along came a spider” in  little brown was still a largely literary house whose more commercial authors included the historian william manchester biographer of winston churchill patterson’s success in the subsequent years encouraged little brown to fully embrace massmarket fiction but more than that patterson almost singlehandedly created a template for the modern blockbuster author advertisement continue reading the main story there were of course blockbuster authors before patterson among them mario puzo james michener and danielle steel but never had authors been marketed essentially as consumer goods paving the way for a small group of writers from charlaine harris to malcolm gladwell to dominate bestseller lists — often with several titles at a time — in the same way that brands like skippy and grey poupon dominate supermarket shelves “until the last  years or so the thought that you could massmerchandise authors had always been resisted” says larry kirshbaum former ceo of the time warner book group which owned little brown until  “jim was at the forefront of changing that”the lesson was not easily learned publishing is an inherently conservative business patterson repeatedly challenged industry convention sometimes over the objections of his own publisher when little brown was preparing to release “along came a spider” patterson tried to persuade his publisher that the best way to get the book onto bestseller lists was to advertise aggressively on television little brown initially balked bookstores typically base their stocking decisions on the sales of an author’s previous books and patterson’s had not done particularly well this was going to be the first of several novels about an africanamerican homicide detective in washington dc named alex cross the prevailing wisdom was that the audience for a series built around a recurring character needed to be nurtured gradually what’s more largescale tv advertising was rare in publishing not only because of the prohibitive cost but also for cultural reasons the thinking was that selling a book as if it were a lawncare product could very well backfire by turning off potential readerspatterson wrote produced and paid for a commercial himself it opened with a spider dropping down the screen and closed with a voiceover “you can stop waiting for the next ‘silence of the lambs’ ” once little brown saw the ad it agreed to share the cost of rolling it out over the course of several weeks in three particularly strong thriller markets — new york chicago and washington “along came a spider” made its debut at no  on the new york times hardcover bestseller list ensuring it favorable placement near the entrance of bookstores probably the single biggest driver of book sales it rose to no  in paperback and remains patterson’s most successful book with more than five million copies in printit’s not hard to understand the popularity of “along came a spider” it’s a police procedural with an uncomplicated yet evertwisting plot some sex betrayal and plenty of violence the book’s hero cross is smart and tough yet sensitive and vulnerable he has a phd in forensic psychology from johns hopkins lost his wife in a driveby shooting — leaving him to raise his two children alone — plays gershwin on a beatup babygrand piano and volunteers at the soup kitchen of his local parish still hundreds of suspenseful fastpaced novels are published each year few become successful let alone blockbusters it’s entirely possible even quite likely that without those ads “along came a spider ” never would have made the bestseller list and that james patterson would now be just another thriller writerpatterson quickly turned alex cross into a booming franchise encouraging little brown to unify the series with a single jacket style — shiny with big type and bold colorful lettering — and titles drawn from nursery rhymes “kiss the girls” “pop goes the weasel” “the big bad wolf” with their foreboding sense of innocence interrupted “jim was sensitive to the fact that books carry a kind of elitist persona and he wanted his books to be enticing to people who might not have done so well in school and were inclined to look at books as a headache” kirshbaum says “he wanted his jackets to say ‘buy me read me have fun — this isn’t “moby dick” ’ ”patterson built his fan following methodically instead of simply going to the biggest bookbuying markets he focused his early tours and advertising efforts on cities where his books were selling best like a politician aspiring to higher office he was shoring up his base from there he began reaching out to a wider audience often through unconventional means when sales figures showed that he and john grisham were running nearly neck and neck on the east coast but that grisham had a big lead out west patterson set his second thriller series “the women’s murder club” about a group of women who solve murder mysteries in san franciscono sooner had patterson established himself in the thriller market than he started moving into new genres kirshbaum didn’t initially like the idea he was worried that patterson would confuse his thriller fans patterson’s first nonthriller “miracle on the th green” published in  did very well that same year patterson wanted to try publishing more than one book despite little brown’s view that he would cannibalize his own audience in addition to “miracle on the th green” patterson published “hide and seek” and “jack and jill” each of which was a best seller from there patterson gradually added more titles each year not only did more books mean more sales they also meant greater visibility ensuring that patterson’s name would almost always be at the front of bookstores with the rest of the new releases patterson encountered similar resistance when he introduced the idea of using coauthors which little brown warned would dilute his brand once again the books were best sellers “eventually i stopped fighting him and went along for the ride” kirshbaum sayspatterson’s vision of a limitless empire forced little brown to reorder its priorities publishers have finite resources and the demands of publishing patterson were extraordinary even for a blockbuster author some little brown editors worried that other books were suffering as a result “to have one writer really start needing and even demanding the lion’s share of energy and attention was difficult” sarah crichton little brown’s publisher from  to  told me “there were times when some of us resented that when jim felt that resentment he roared back and he was too powerful to ignore” advertisement continue reading the main story crichton says she was continually surprised by the success of patterson’s books to her they lacked the nuance and originality of other blockbuster genre writers like stephen king or dean koontz “jim felt his ambitions weren’t being taken seriously enough” crichton says “and in retrospect he was probably right” photo credit marcus gaab for the new york times set design by stefan beckman when i visited patterson one day in florida this fall his wife met me at the door in tennis whites patterson soon followed in a white polo shirt pleated blue trousers and boat shoes he stopped in the kitchen to pour himself a glass of orange fanta and led me upstairs to his home office an airy uncluttered woodpaneled room overlooking a lap pool — sue who is  years his junior was an allamerican swimmer at the university of wisconsin in the late s — and the intracoastal waterwaypatterson’s bookshelves are evenly divided between thrillers — books by michael connelly and jeffrey deaver — and more highbrow literary fare like philip roth john cheever and denis johnson when i asked him what he was reading now patterson mentioned “wolf hall” by hilary mantel the winner of the  man booker prize and “the power broker” robert caro’s doorstop biography of robert moses “my favorite books are very dense ones” patterson told me “i love ‘one hundred years of solitude’ and i’m a big james joyce fan — well at least until ‘finnegans wake’ he kind of lost me there”there is no computer in patterson’s office he writes in longhand on a legal pad and gives the pages to his assistant to type up hanging above the round wooden table where he works is a photograph of president clinton taken during the monica lewinsky scandal walking down the steps of marine one with a copy of patterson’s “when the wind blows” tucked under his arm patterson’s popularity in washington is apparently bipartisan the wall of one of his downstairs bathrooms is plastered with fan mail from both george bushes neatly arranged on an adjacent lshaped desk were  stacks of paper of varying heights patterson’s works in progresspatterson grew up in newburgh ny the son of a tough man who overcame a difficult childhood raised in the local poorhouse by a single mother patterson’s father earned a scholarship to hamilton college and dreamed of becoming a writer or a diplomat but wound up selling insurance “he didn’t have a father and i don’t think he knew how to do it” patterson told me when his father retired he wrote a novel and showed it to patterson already an established author patterson gave him the same advice he gives all firsttime novelists write another onepatterson discovered books late for a man who now makes a fortune writing them right after his senior year in high school his family moved to a suburb of boston and patterson got a job working nights and weekends as an aide at mclean hospital in belmont with nothing else to do on his overnight shifts he guzzled coffee and readat first patterson’s literary taste ran toward the highbrow — jerzy kosinski jean genet evan s connell “i was a snob” he says after graduating from manhattan college in  patterson was given a free ride to vanderbilt university’s graduate program in english literature but dropped out after just one year “i had found two things that i loved reading and writing” he told me “if i became a college professor i knew i was going to wind up killing them both off”instead patterson moved to new york and got a job as a junior copywriter at j walter thompson he also started reading commercial books like “the exorcist” and “the day of the jackal” “i always felt i could write a reasonable literary novel but not a great one” he says “then i thought i can do this i understand it and i like it” patterson set up a typewriter on the kitchen table of his small apartment on th street and manhattan avenue and wrote after work every night and on weekends the result was his first novel “the thomas berryman number” advertisement continue reading the main story more than a dozen publishers rejected patterson’s manuscript before his agent whom patterson found in a newspaper article finally sold it to little brown for  “i remember going up to boston — little brown was still in boston then — and walking into this library with a huge fireplace” patterson recalls of his first visit to his publisher “on the bookshelves were all of these other little brown books ‘catcher in the rye’ ‘the french lieutenant’s woman’ ‘the executioner’s song’ i’m thinking they’re going to publish me this is so cool”“the thomas berryman number” is the story of a newspaperman in nashville who is assigned to cover the assassination of a local politician and ends up on the trail of his murderer a professional killer from the texas panhandle named thomas berryman the action bounces around a lot ricocheting between berryman’s various murders the newspaperman’s reporting and his subsequent effort to turn his articles on the case into a book “berryman” bears none of the hallmarks of patterson’s later thrillers it’s more brooding and stylized more classically noir the bad guy — berryman — is not a sadist or a psychopathic serial killer he’s a hired gun there is no real good guy other than the reporter and narrator at its best the prose can call to mind raymond chandler here’s berryman in the book’s opening pages about to hitch a ride out of texas with a man he would soon kill “thomas berryman shaded his sunglasses so he could see the approaching car better a finely made coil of brown dust followed it like a streamer buzzards crossed its path heading east toward wichita falls”the book won a prestigious edgar award for a first novel from the mystery writers of america no doubt some of those who praised it at the time would now say patterson has failed to live up to its literary promise that’s not how patterson sees it “it’s more convoluted more bleak — more of the sort of thing that some people will find praiseworthy” he says of “the thomas berryman number” “the sentences are superior to a lot of the stuff i write now but the story isn’t as good i’m less interested in sentences now and more interested in stories”after “the thomas berryman number” patterson wrote several more books for a number of different publishers that were neither successful nor critically acclaimed in  he tried his hand at the “demonic child” genre — memorably popularized by the film “rosemary’s baby”— with the horror novel “virgin” which was later retitled and published as “cradle and all” in  the year the movie “wall street” was released he published a wall street thriller called “black market”patterson is unsentimental about his early somewhat clumsy attempts at popular fiction “that’s an absolutely horrifying book” he says of his  novel “season of the machete” the story of a sadistic husbandandwife team who carry out a series of gory machete murders on a caribbean island “i actually tell people not to read it”several weeks later i witnessed this firsthand at one of patterson’s signings when a woman handed him a copy of the book to autograph he groaned “not my best work” patterson said “it’s scaring me half to death” the woman answered “don’t read it” patterson repliedwhat is perhaps most remarkable about the patterson empire is the sheer volume of books it produces the nine hardcovers a year are really only the beginning nearly all of those books are published a second and third time first as traditional paperbacks then as pocketsize massmarket paperbacks “scarcely a week goes by when we aren’t publishing something by james patterson” young told me only halfjokingthis summer patterson will begin his fourth thriller series “private” which centers on a detective agency with branches all over the world in addition he does frequent thriller oneoffs including an annual summer beach read usually set at or near a resort advertisement continue reading the main story the thriller genre is generally not for the squeamish but patterson’s tend to be especially graphic and the violence often involves sociopathic sexual perversion and attractive young women for instance the villain in his second alex cross novel “kiss the girls” is a psychopath who kidnaps rapes and tortures college girls in an underground bunker at one point he even feeds a live snake into the anus of one of his victimsas long as there has been massmarket fiction it has had its detractors in the late victorian era the english poet and cultural critic matthew arnold denounced “the tawdry novels which flare in the bookshelves of our railway stations and which seem designed    for people with a low standard of life” yet even within the maligned genre patterson has some especially nasty critics the washington post’s thriller reviewer patrick anderson called “kiss the girls” “sick sexist sadistic and subliterate” stephen king has described patterson as “a terrible writer”patterson has written in just about every genre — science fiction fantasy romance “women’s weepies” graphic novels christmasthemed books he dabbles in nonfiction as well in  he published “against medical advice” a book written from the perspective of the son of a friend who suffers from tourette’s syndrome and last year he took on the supposed murder of the child pharaoh king tutpatterson’s fastestgrowing franchise is his youngadult books he published his first ya title “maximum ride the angel experiment” in  not long after the languishing genre was jumpstarted by blockbusters like “harry potter” and “sisterhood of the traveling pants” last month he introduced his third ya series “witch and wizard” a dystopian fantasy about a teenage brother and sister who wake up to discover that they are living in a totalitarian regime and that they have supernatural powers that have made them enemies of the state despite some negative prepublication reviews the book was criticproof making its debut at no  on the times bestseller list for children’s chapter bookseach of patterson’s series has its own fan base but there are also plenty of people who read everything he writes his books all share stylistic similarities they are light on atmospherics and heavy on action conveyed by simple colloquial sentences “i don’t believe in showing off” patterson says of his writing “showing off can get in the way of a good story”patterson’s chapters are very short which creates a lot of halfblank pages his books are in a very literal sense pageturners he avoids description back story and scene setting whenever possible preferring to hurl readers into the action and establish his characters with a minimum of telegraphic details the first chapter of “the swimsuit” a recent thriller with a villain who abducts women for pornographic snuff films opens with the kidnapping of a supermodel on a beach in hawaii“kim mcdaniels was barefooted and wearing a blueandwhitestriped juicy couture minidress when she was awoken by a thump against her hip a bruising thump she opened her eyes in the blackness as questions broke the surface of her mind photo credit marcus gaab for the new york times set design by stefan beckman “where was she what the hell was going on”to maintain his frenetic pace of production patterson now uses coauthors for nearly all of his books he is part executive producer part head writer setting out the vision for each book or series and then ensuring that his writers stay the course this kind of collaboration is second nature to patterson from his advertising days and it’s certainly common in other creative industries including television but writing a novel is not the same thing as coming up with jokes for david letterman or plotting an episode of “” books at least in their traditional conception are the product of one person’s imagination and sensibility rendered in a singular unreproducible style and voice some novelists have tried using coauthors usually with limited success certainly none have taken collaboration to the level patterson has with his five regular coauthors each one specializing in a different patterson series or genre “duke ellington said ‘i need an orchestra otherwise i wouldn’t know how my music sounds’ ” pietsch told me when i asked him about patterson’s use of collaborators “jim created a process and a team that can help him hear how his music sounds”the way it usually works patterson will write a detailed outline — sometimes as long as  pages triplespaced — and one of his coauthors will draft the chapters for him to read revise and when necessary rewrite when he’s first starting to work with a new collaborator a book will typically require numerous drafts over time the process invariably becomes more efficient patterson pays his coauthors out of his own pocket on the adult side his collaborators work directly and exclusively with patterson on the ya side they sometimes work with patterson’s youngadult editor who decides when pages are ready to be

online forums that his cowritten books feel too “cookie cutter” and lack the “roller coaster” feel of his previous work but his sales certainly haven’t suffered in at least one instance patterson took on a coauthor in an effort to boost sales last year after noticing he wasn’t selling in scandinavia he invited sweden’s bestselling crime writer liza marklund to collaborate with him on an international thriller their novel “the postcard killers” is just being published in sweden and will be out in the us this summer advertisement continue reading the main story for the most part though patterson draws his coauthors from the vast sea of struggling writers a few weeks after visiting patterson i had lunch with one of his collaborators michael ledwidge in manhattan an amiable yearold redhead in a black leather jacket and jeans ledwidge told me he grew up in a large workingclass irish family in the bronx he wanted to be a cop but when he applied in  the police academy was oversubscribed so he worked as a doorman and started writing a heist novel on the side when ledwidge learned that he and james patterson shared an alma mater manhattan college he delivered his halffinished manuscript to patterson one morning at j walter thompson that night his phone rang“it must be james patterson” ledwidge joked to his wifeit was patterson helped ledwidge get his first book published and his writing career started a few books later ledwidge had garnered some critical acclaim but not much commercial success in  patterson suggested that they collaborate on “step on a crack” his first michael bennett novel ledwidge leapt at the opportunity the book went straight to no  on the times bestseller list one book quickly led to another in  ledwidge quit his day job as a cablesplicer at verizon left the bronx for connecticut and became a fulltime coauthor for james pattersonledwidge told me that he and patterson have an easy working relationship that patterson playfully teases him when he writes a scene that patterson doesn’t like and praises him when he’s pleased with something i asked ledwidge if he missed writing his own books “honestly ” he asked “not at all this is much more fun”one night in florida patterson and i met his wife and their yearold son jack for dinner at the palm beach grill when the maître d’ noticed patterson entering the restaurant she told him his table was ready a welldressed whitehaired woman quickly spun around“are you james patterson” she asked excitedly“yes” patterson answered“i just read your last one what was it called”patterson hesitated unsure which book she was talking about“it was brutal” she woman continued“ ‘the swimsuit’” patterson ventured“yeah” the woman said “boy was it brutal i liked it but it was brutal”after dinner sue and jack went home and patterson and i had another glass of wine and continued talking patterson told me that jack who had been working on his laptop for most of the meal only recently started to like reading it required a deliberate effort on patterson’s part beginning a few summers ago patterson told jack he didn’t have to do any chores he just had to read for an hour or so every day the first summer jack resisted the second summer he didn’t complain last summer he no longer needed any prodding patterson ticked off some of the books jack had recently read and enjoyed — “to kill a mockingbird” “a wrinkle in time” and “huckleberry finn” — with obvious pride advertisement continue reading the main story patterson told me that jack’s initial reluctance to read helped inspire him to move into the ya genre he wanted to write books for preteens and teenagers that would be fun and easy to read the youngadult realm was in one sense a big leap for an author known for violent thrillers at the same time it was a natural fit for patterson whose unadorned prose and fastpaced plots are well suited to reluctant readers promoting literacy among children has since become a pet cause for him he has his own web site readkiddoreadcom aimed at helping parents choose books for their children “there are millions of kids who have never read a book that they liked and that is a national disgrace” patterson said “what i’m trying to do is at least wake up several thousand of them”later our conversation turned to patterson’s critics “thousands of people don’t like what i do” patterson told me shrugging off his detractors “fortunately millions do” for all of his commercial success though patterson seemed bothered by the fact that he has not been given his due — that unlike king or even grisham who have managed to transcend their genres he continues to be dismissed as an airport author or worse a marketing genius who has cynically maneuvered his way to bestsellerdom by writing remedial novels that pander to the public’s basest instincts “caricature assassination” patterson called itpatterson said too much has been made of his marketing savvy a few years ago a professor at harvard business school went so far as to do a case study on him to patterson the explanation for his success is less complicated whether he’s writing about a serial killer a love affair between a doctor and poet in martha’s vineyard or a middleaged ad executive who miraculously becomes an exceptional putter and joins the senior golf tour his books are accessible and engaging “a brand is just a connection between something and a bunch of people” patterson told me “crest toothpaste i always used it it tastes ok so i don’t have any particular reason to switch here the connection is that james patterson writes books that bubble along with heroes i can get interested in that’s it”patterson considers himself as an entertainer not a man of letters still he bristles when he hears one of his books described as a guilty pleasure “why should anyone feel guilty about reading a book” patterson said that what he does — coming up with stories that will resonate with a lot of people and rendering them in a readable style — is no different from what king grisham and other popular authors do “i have a saying” patterson told me “if you want to write for yourself get a diary if you want to write for a few friends get a blog but if you want to write for a lot of people think about them a little bit what do they like what are their needs a lot of people in this country go through their days numb they need to be entertained they need to feel something”shortly before we left the restaurant patterson brought up “the swimsuit” again “i like ‘the swimsuit’ ” he said “it’s nasty but i like it but i think i went a little farther than i needed to i’m going to tone it down for the paperback”patterson noticed a look of surprise on my face it’s not every day that an author decides to rewrite one of his books “look” he said “if you’re writing ‘crime and punishment’ or ‘remembrance of things past’ then you can sit back and go ‘this is it this is the book this is high art i’m the man you’re not the end’ but i’m not the man and this is not high art”whatever ambivalence once existed toward patterson inside little brown has long since been replaced by unequivocal enthusiasm and gratitude pietsch who succeeded crichton as publisher says patterson belongs in the same class as chandler and dashiell hammett “every novel of jim’s is master class in terms of plotting pace and striking the right balance between action and emotional content” pietsch told me “i have never read a writer who i think is better at keeping your eye moving forward and your heart moving forward”thanks in part to patterson little brown’s identity has changed considerably since he first visited the publisher’s former offices in a town house on beacon hill in boston in addition to patterson it is now home to such thriving commercial novelists as michael connelly and stephenie meyer author of the wildly popular “twilight” vampire series as well as consistent best sellers like malcolm gladwell and david sedaris in  a year in which many of its competitors were laying off employees and shutting down imprints little brown gave out christmas bonuses advertisement continue reading the main story in september little brown hosted an anniversary dinner in patterson’s honor — “ years of publishing james patterson” — in a private room at daniel one of the most expensive restaurants in manhattan patterson left little brown after “the thomas berryman number” but returned in  a few years before “along came a spider” with a book called “the midnight club” it wasn’t the sort of party you see often in the world of publishing particularly now with much of the industry in free fall in addition to a meal of crabmeat salad beef tenderloin and warm madeleines the  guests were given party favors bottles of red wine with labels that read “vintage patterson”days earlier hachette book group and patterson’s representative the washington lawyer robert barnett hammered out the terms of a new book deal forbes reported that the contract is worth at least  million though little brown and patterson dispute the number “don’t you need to be home writing” i joked with patterson he told me matteroffactly that he’d already started  of the  books and even finished more than a few of them photo credit marcus gaab for the new york times set design by stefan beckman some toasts accompanied the dinner pietsch talked about the conflicting mythology surrounding who actually discovered patterson “not only did i know the editor who discovered james patterson i once ate a hamburger cooked on his grill” patterson’s youngadult editor andrea spooner recounted her campaign to persuade her father an english professor that patterson was a worthy writer “ ‘it’s worth noting daddy that dickens was one of the most popular and successful storytellers of his time too’ ” when young told the crowd that patterson “contributes significantly” to five of hachette’s six publishing groups patterson interjected “what am i missing”“faithwords” young replied referring to the company’s religious imprint“i can do that” patterson saidpatterson was the last to speak the only man in the room without a tie he wore a black tshirt beneath his dark suit “i’m sorry my good friend stephen king couldn’t be here” he began “it must be bingo night in bangor”patterson then proceeded to tell one of his favorite stories about his mother’s father who drove a frozenfoods truck in upstate new york during the summer patterson said he would occasionally get up at  in the morning to ride along with him as they drove over a mountain toward his first delivery patterson’s grandfather an irrepressibly joyful man would be singing at the top of his lungs “one day he said to me ‘jim i don’t care what you do when you grow up i don’t care if you drive a truck like i do or if you become the president just remember that when you go over the mountain to work in the morning you’ve got to be singing’ ” patterson went on “well i am”it’s no surprise that patterson loves what he does what’s not to love he plays golf most mornings on donald trump’s palm beach course and spends the rest of the day working on guaranteed best sellers for which he is paid millionsbut the image of patterson as a carefree man lucky enough to make money doing what he loves is a bit misleading patterson is nothing if not relentlessly ambitious at j walter thompson he rose from the lowly station of junior copywriter to become the youngest creative director in the firm’s history — along the way dreaming up such ad slogans as “i’m a toys ‘r’ us kid” — and then the ceo of the company’s north american operations and as patterson is the first to admit he didn’t even like working in advertising it goes without saying that writing was never just a hobby for him advertisement continue reading the main story patterson’s current preoccupation is hollywood despite some attempts including two alex cross films both starring morgan freeman which patterson doesn’t think much of some madefortv movies a failed abc series and a lot of books that were optioned but never developed there still hasn’t been a blockbuster film or hit tv show based on one of his novelsa few years ago patterson hired a former colleague from j walter thompson steve bowen to oversee the development of his various movie and television projects in  they signed a deal with avi arad the producer of the “spiderman” and “xmen” films to make a movie based on patterson’s “maximum ride” youngadult series in addition to trying to make sure that patterson is more involved in the development process patterson and bowen plan to produce some projects themselves they have already raised the financing for a new alex cross movie that patterson is helping to writewhen i met bowen a goodlooking exmarine with a trimmed graying beard for coffee in manhattan several weeks after the dinner at daniel he told me that part of his challenge is to change hollywood’s perception of patterson he cited clint eastwood whose name was once synonymous with “dirty harry” and spaghetti westerns as a model for the sort of image transformation they are aiming to pull off “jim’s been wrongly stereotyped out there as the master of slash and gash” bowen said “what people don’t fully understand is that there’s a unique talent and storytelling ability that has allowed him to do what he’s done in the book world he just knows what’s going to grab people the man has a golden gut”in the mids jacqueline susann the author of “valley of the dolls”  million copies sold famously demonstrated — via hundreds of bookstore signings — that even blockbuster books are built one reader at a time when patterson was still making his name he too barnstormed the country signing books late into the night and exhausting publicists these days though patterson doesn’t do many bookstore events he certainly doesn’t need the publicity and he would rather be home with sue and jack but on a monday night in midnovember he turned up at a cardealershipsize barnes  noble in a strip mall on route  in paramus nj to promote his latest alex cross novel “i alex cross”this is patterson’s th cross book since “along came a spider” cross has been through a lot he has had several jobs and a number of illfated relationships he has chased down numerous serial killers a russian mobster and a cult of goths and has even written his own novel based on his late uncle’s investigation of a series of lynchings in mississippi in the early spatterson came straight from the newark airport arriving early to sign the store’s “i alex cross” stock in a back room “we haven’t seen you in years” said dennis wurst a barnes  noble manager of author promotions who stopped by to say hello“how’s business” patterson asked“it helps when you write an alex cross book” wurst answereda month before barnes  noble was caught in the crossfire of a preholiday pricing war between walmart and amazon with walmart dropping its prices on several hardcover blockbusters including “i alex cross” to  more than  percent off the retail price the battle set off a panic inside an alreadyanxious publishing industry such deep discounting may help move merchandise but along with trends like the proliferation of ereaders that instantly deliver many blockbusters for  or less it further devalues books the days of  hardcovers are surely numbered without those revenues publishers will be even more reluctant to devote shrinking resources to new unproven authors which will in turn limit the range of books being published advertisement continue reading the main story whatever the future of publishing may hold patterson’s place in it seems secure by the time he was introduced at the paramus store in excess of  people — more women than men but fairly evenly divided with a handful of children as well — had crowded into the bookstore’s large event space to see him stragglers were looking vainly for a spot on the wall to lean up against patterson dressed casually in a sweater and slacks delivered some brief remarks took a handful of questions and then got down to the main event — signing books to avoid a crush of people at the signing table the staff divided the audience into several groups by letter they were told that patterson would autograph any of his books purchased in the paramus store and one additional title from their own patterson collection but that he would not personalize any copiesthe system quickly broke down patterson was soon adding names and short inscriptions to books he bantered easily with his fans as he wrote many asked about jack more than one wanted to know if he had brought any pictures“i skipped work to be here” one woman said as her husband snapped a picture of her with patterson“that’s always a good thing” patterson said“well i’m a police officer so i guess that’s bad” the woman replied“i won’t tell” patterson saidthere is something unique about the relationship between readers and their favorite authors a sense of emotional intimacy that doesn’t exist say between sports fans and athletes patterson’s fans can read him virtually all year they aren’t just addicted to his books they see him as a constant companion a part of their lives one woman asked patterson to sign a book for her grandmother who passed away a few days earlier “we used to read your books together and i want to put it in her casket with her” she said another told patterson that he got her reading again after a recent stroke a truck driver said that he had never read any of patterson’s books but that he had listened to every single one of them on the road “i don’t know what i’d do without them”still another woman gestured at her elderly mother whom she was pushing in a wheelchair “she just had heart surgery you make her happy and that makes me happy”“and that makes me happy” patterson saidafter an hour of signing books without interruption patterson seemed to be doing fine “we’re really cooking along here” he told his publicist a halfhour later though patterson was starting to tire “this is getting out of hand” he saidafter almost two hours a voice finally came over the loudspeaker “will all remaining groups please report to the james patterson signing area” patterson signed his last books posed for a few photographs with some of the store’s employees and got ready to go “that was a fairly respectable crowd” he said as we walked to the escalatoron our way out patterson picked up on a theme he raised with me weeks earlier during our conversation about his detractors “this goes to the notion we were talking about in florida about my critics — people who call themselves openminded but then make judgments about what i write” he said “well these people like it they’re happy so what’s the big deal” correction january   an article on page  this weekend about the writer james patterson refers
