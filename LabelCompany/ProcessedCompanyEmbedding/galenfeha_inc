common stock by the selling security holders all of the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock will go to the selling security holders we have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the registration of the common stock for the selling security holders our initial power generation product is unique to the natural gas market therefore there is no direct competitor however our product would be considered a replacement for the traditional combination of deep cycle leadacid batteries and solar panels in each of these industries there are a large number of companies around the world manufacturing deep cycle leadacid batteries and solar panels according to an annual market survey done by photon international the top  solar module players are dominated by chinese companies the us companies listed were first solar and sunpower today the main solution for powering remote well locations comprises a combination of leadacid deepcycle battery and portable solar panels both of these products are required to create the current power source for remote computerized flow meters for our initial target market major modes of failure of deepcycle batteries are loss of the active material due to shedding of the plates and corrosion of the internal grid that supports active material the capacity of a deep cycle battery is usually limited by electrolyte capacity and not by the plate mass to improve life expectancy solar power has its drawbacks as well according to an article posted to clean energy ideas the disadvantage of solar energy include high upfront installation costs large surface area required dependence on the weather no nighttime functionality the article can be found here wwwcleanenergyideascomsolarsolarenergydisadvantages ofsolarenergy in each of these industries there are a large number of companies around the world manufacturing deep cycle leadacid batteries and solar panels according to an annual market survey done by photon international the top  solar module players are dominated by chinese companies the us companies listed were first solar and sunpower among the leaders in the deepcycle lead acid battery manufacturers are exide technologies northstar battery and crown batteries all of these companies have well established manufacturing and distribution networks worldwide we believe our product will have none of the inherent issues associated with technologies currently being used to power remote well production locations our product is not dependent on nor affected by weather conditions nor does it contribute to the carbon footprint or climatic change issues because it uses the naturally occurring flow of kinetic energy within natural gas pipelines to create power we believe our product will produce clean sustainable power as long as the well is producing gas we believe that our greatest challenges will be establishing a broad distribution network creating a supply chain management system and commercializing our product to the greater portion of north america company description galenfeha was incorporated on march   under the laws of the state of nevada with a fiscal year end of december  we are an engineering company that will be providing engineering services and an alternative power generation product mainly to natural gas producers not only will we be providing contractual engineering services we hope to implement our proprietary product into the mainstream of natural gas production sites and sell the product to natural gas producers through a distribution network of oil field services companies currently computerized flow meters used in remote natural gas production locations are powered by lead acid deepcycle marine batteries that are in turn powered by solar panels which can be subject to weather conditions and require significant space and specialized maintenance depending on the size of the natural gas operation there may be multiple flow meters per production site galenfeha is developing a kinetic energy solution that would eliminate or reduce the dependence on the solar panellead acid battery combination and provide a simple easy to install mechanism that utilizes the energy that already exists within the natural gas pipeline to power the computerized flow meters during august of  a series of successful bench tests proved the feasibility of our product our product operates in the gas flow and utilizes the existing kinetic energy flowing through natural gas in recovery pipelines to generate power for the computerized flow meter that measure a well’s output we believe this product will generate an abundance of power enough to support the flow computers power requirements and spare capacity that could be resold to regional power distributers we believe our product will reduce the dependence on conventional options such as expensive solar panels and hazardous lead acid batteries which have historically been used at natural gas production sites to power computerized flow meters we also believe that our product delivers several significant benefits to natural gas producers and the energy industry as a whole this technology is designed to  simplify the current kluge of apparatus needed to monitor computerized flow meters  generate a reliable lower carbon footprint source for computerized flow meters  increase clean energy production and  provide additional revenue as an alternative energy source for redistribution to local utilities  galenfeha is a development stage company incorporated in the state of nevada on march   as a
