this story joins others in the  progress special section featured inside sundays edition of the opelikaauburn news editors note this story joined others in the  progress special section copies are available at the office of the opelikaauburn newsdavid housel began as a bundle of untapped passion comprised of all the essential ingredients required of a diehard fan a love of football an appreciation of the history an ability to lose himself in the grandeur of a big game — if only he had any fandom to speak ofthe year was  the location was birmingham and the occasion was the annual iron bowl between host alabama and visiting auburn housel led by his father had never witnessed such a spectaclethe yearold watched with wide eyes as the two teams clashed on the field below in a battle for his heart all he needed was one of them to give him a convincing reason to move allinthe tigers won the game — “” housel now  said with a casualness that suggested the decadesold memory exists fresh in his mind — but housel held onto his reservations for just a bit longer soon after the game he decided to give each university one more chance reaching out to both with handwritten lettersauburn responded by sending him a media guide and a note thanking him for being an auburn fan alabama sent him a media guide and a bill for two dollars“i think it’s safe to say that alabama got their two dollars” housel said “but auburn got my heart”it was the note that made all the difference auburn made clear it wanted housel and from then on housel never stopped wanting to be a part of auburnin his gordo high senior yearbook the quote under housel’s photo read “auburn sweet auburn the loveliest village on the plains” all these years later — after graduating from au in  with a degree in journalism and rising from ticket office administrative assistant  to journalism professor  to assistant sports information director  to head sid  to athletic director  becoming an author and an awardwinning freelance writer along the way  — housel’s feelings about auburn have never changed“i think auburn is a place where you can make it” the auburn athletics director emeritus said “farm boy city boy doesn’t matter — i think auburn is a place you can make it the only thing i’ve ever really dreamed of doing was coming to auburn and being a part of it”a part of it no housel is far more than that“david is mr auburn” current auburn athletics director jay jacobs said “there’s nobody else even close when you talk about auburn he’s synonymous with it all the good things that are represented by the auburn family that’s what david housel embodies”“david always used to say ‘when people come to campus they may or may not remember what the final score was but i want to make sure they remember how well they were treated at auburn’ and he’s always done that always he always treated people with kindness and compassion and the auburn way”most everyone on the plains has felt it“who in auburn doesn’t know david housel” auburn mayor bill ham said “who hasn’t been impacted either by his writings or some of the things he’s been involved with he is just absolutely a wonderful person he received the lifetime achievement award by the alumni association in  and if you look at the list of individuals that have been awarded it it is so incredible yet so fitting for him that he received that award because it exemplifies what david housel is”memories from a storied careeran irreplaceable piece of the auburn story housel has gathered treasured memories along his journeythere was the time in  when auburn football coach shug jordan greeted housel with open arms at a football practice the morning after housel won the election for editor of the plainsman the two chatted not as studenteditor to sec head coach but as one friend to anotherthere were game days in the press box images that remain crystallized in the memory of the former sid who says “nostalgia is my middle name”“i would tell my staff ‘it’s going to be our sports information staff against their sports information staff’” housel said “and i said ‘and we’re sure as hell going to win it’ auburn’s going to win it now how do you win a press box you do the best job of being professional”and then there was oct   when housel was immortalized in jordanhare stadium by having the venue’s press box named after him during a ceremony in which a commemorative plaque was unveiled“it was one of those experiences that teaches you humility… they had the plaque covered up by a coke machine” housel said with a laugh “so there’s this real nice thing going on them talking about all my accomplishments and why they named it after me and it was covered up by a coke machine which is ok it didn’t bother me i thought that was pretty funny and still do”of course housel would relish the humor of it that kind of thing is right up his alleyjacobs remembers in  his drive back from tuscaloosa with housel after auburn had won the iron bowl  housel made jacobs stop at three or four convenience stores along the ride home“we’d walk in and he’d buy a stick of gum or something and he’d always ask the person behind the counter ‘who won the auburnalabama game’ and wait for the reaction most of them had on an alabama sweatshirt” jacobs recalled “he had a lot of fun like that i’ve even heard him ask people at restaurants waiters and waitresses ‘so what do you think about the athletic director that housel guy’ he’s a guy that could laugh at himself and enjoy people as much as anybody i’ve ever seen”the storyteller’s storystill along with getting a laugh out of it housel saw some symbolism in the coke machinecovered plaque“nothing is permanent” housel said “there are folks that don’t know who i am and certainly they have no reason to there are certainly people who work there who really never knew football coach pat dye and people for whom bo jackson is just a name out of history and talking about coach jordan now is like talking about black jack pershing in world war i time passes and as the years go by you recede further and further to the background”housel then smiles “and that’s fine with me”in his dotage housel for so long the articulator of auburn’s story confidently passes the baton to future generations the interpretation of his own legacy is in their hands too but it’s housel’s faith in auburn’s posterity that is perhaps the truest way of quantifying his love for the place“i think auburn is a place that brings out the best in human nature” he said “i think if i have any role to play now it’s probably as an elder statesman trying to define what auburn was and what auburn is but it’s not for me to define what auburn will be that’s for the next generation and i’m confident they’ll do a good job with it”more than athleticsmatthew holt an au graduate student in the pharmacy school and a member of that next generation knew nothing of housel before the two met in the spring semester of “this will make me sound very auburnnaive” holt said “but actually no i didn’t know much about him at all”holt took part in housel’s honors college book club while he was still in undergrad during one class housel asked for a show of hands to see who had completed the assigned reading it happened to be the one week holt didn’t and he was only person not to raise his hand“so he told me ‘all right you can either read the book and come discuss it with me at a lunch or fail the class” holt said “hopefully he was just kidding about that last part” soon after the two had lunch together at byron’s smokehouse on opelika road“at first i was afraid ‘gosh what is this going to be like’ i was worried that he was going to be guilttripping me about not reading the assignment” holt said “but there was really none of that all he wanted was just a oneonone chance to pick my brain and get all of my opinions and thoughts on what i had just read he really just used it as a time to get to know me personally and to have a deeper discussion”this is the part of housel’s legacy at auburn that has nothing to do with athletics“the reason i became his friend is because he wanted to contribute his time to the auburn honors college” holt said “i would have never formed a relationship with him had he not chosen to keep contributing to auburn in an area quite distinct from the athletic department“this is a man who made it to the top of the athletic department and of course that was his passion but he’s never stopped trying to tell the world that auburn is more than that”still hererecently housel’s role has reduced to a small yet still neonbright part of auburn’s presentday story“my priority in retirement” housel quipped “is to stay out of everybody’s way”he still holds his weekly honors college book club and holt still attends purely for leisure and the chance to meet up with his friend“out of everything i do” housel said “i enjoy that as much as anything”he reads a lot and even attends two book clubs aside from the one he hosts he walks with the help of a cane or walker which does well to slow him down but does nothing to stop him from attending every auburn football and basketball home gamestill housel is admittedly a bit detached at least in relation to his days in the heart of auburn’s athletics operation some relationships with current au sports figures remain strong but on the whole he doesn’t know the players and coaches like he did back in the day“but i know auburn” housel said “and i want auburn to win“am i as emotionally involved as i was when i was  years old i hope not i hope i’ve grown up some as for when i was working the fate of the western world — the fate of civilization as we knew it — depended on the outcome of the auburnalabama game i have now realized it does not and that has been a freeing experience”housel then paused a disclaimer was necessary“i answer all these questions like that” he continued “but had you been sitting next to me when chris davis ran that alabama fieldgoal attempt back  yards to give auburn a lastsecond victory in the  iron bowl you’d have said that old boy is  years old and the fate of the western world does depend on it”for all his accomplishments and accolades at au for all his hours of service and powerful writings and orations about the place he calls home housel refuses to identify as anything more than “an auburn guy who was lucky enough to spend his life here and is now enjoying his retirement years here”“i busted my butt for auburn not because of any reason other than just trying to make auburn better” housel said “and i was just fortunate to have some opportunities along the way”auburn was fortunate too in case you missed our progress
