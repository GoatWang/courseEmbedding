in the case of yahoo if there ever was a company in need of a sense of urgency it is this one” loeb added that the “real issue is not shortterm versus longterm but about board representatives who have

yahoo for its immense potentialwhile theres still a lot of work ahead theyve given us a great foundation” steven davidoff of new york times observed that yahoo seemed like damaged goods now that it has been abandoned by one of its biggest investors daniel s loeb” noting that yahoos share buyback had “the whiff of greenmail or repurchasing stock to make an investor go away” according to a january  vanity fair profile when loeb told mayer he wanted to sell  million shares or onethird of his remaining holdings mayer stated yahoo would buy back the stock at a guaranteed  per share—but only if he sold  million shares this transaction would bring loeb’s stake below the  percent threshold which meant that he and the other two representatives would have to leave the board loeb also signed a standstill agreement in  that bars him from activist investing in yahoo until  sothebysedit loebs announcement in august  stated that he acquired a  stake in sothebys causing its shares to rise  sothebys announced in september  that it “was considering moves like a share repurchase or raising its dividend” a response to third points having raised its stake in the company the new york times reported that sothebys share price had “climbed about  percent since third point disclosed its increased stake” loeb disclosed on october   that he was now sothebys largest shareholder with a  stake on the same date he announced his desire to join sothebys board and called for the resignation of chairman and ceo william f ruprecht “sothebys is like an old master painting in desperate need of restoration” loeb wrote in a letter to the sec charging that a “crisis of management” at the firm had resulted in “dysfunctional divisions and a fractured culture” as well as “chronically weak operating margins and deteriorating competitive position relative to christies” sothebys main competitor the firm he wrote required new directors and needed for the positions of chairman and ceo to be filled by two different persons not one in a later statement loeb said that “sothebys malaise is a result of a lack of leadership and strategic vision at its highest levels” criticized ruprechts  million salary and chastised the sothebys directors for spending “hundreds of thousands of dollars” in shareholder funds on a single extravagant meal banquet sothebys replied to loeb with a statement maintaining that its “actions as a leader in the global art business have been producing superior results—including a share price increase exceeding the standard  poors midcap index over the one five and ten year periods” adam lindeman of the new york observer in an article headlined “barbarians at sothebys gate” suggested that the “firefight” between loeb and sothebys would “benefit sothebys” a place lindeman described as having “a british clubby feeling of privilege and stuffy pedigree” compared to the “considerably warmer” feel of christies ruprecht announced his resignation in november  sending sothebys shares up around  a day sonyedit loeb criticized the poor performance of sonys summer  films after earth and white house down in a letter issued that year expressing concern that sony ceo kazuo hirai “does not worry about a division that has just released ’s versions of waterworld and ishtar backtoback” loeb proposed a partial spinoff handing about  to  to existing shareholders of sonys entertainment business and even offered to backstop the initial public offering up to  billion to ensure its success “given entertainments perpetual underperformance” loeb wrote “perhaps sonys reluctance to discuss it candidly stems from understandable embarrassment” in addition to asking sony to spin off its entertainment assets loeb sought a spinoff of its financial services division loebs letter sent sony stock up about  at the time third point was sony’s largest shareholder with a  stake sonys board announced on may   that it was considering loebs proposal to spin off its entertainment division “we will engage in thorough discussions at the board level to decide on sonys response  it is an important matter that relates to sonys core businesses and management so the board must hold ample discussions” hirai said the new york times noted that japanese corporations “have a history of ignoring letters from shareholders calling for overhauls” hirai ultimately rejected loebs suggestion saying “sonys entertainment businesses are critical to our corporate strategy and will be important drivers of growth and i am firmly committed to assuring their growth to improving their profitability and to aggressively leveraging their collaboration with our electronics and service business” one factor in hirais decision was the counsel of advisers who argued “that subsidiary initial public offerings have rarely succeeded” sonys sole concession to loeb was an agreement “to disclose more information about the entertainment units financials” third point expressed disappointment in sonys decision but welcomed “sonys commitment to greater transparency” mgmedit the hollywood reporter reported in may  that loeb was buying up shares of mgm leading cnbc commentators to note that loeb who already owned stakes in yahoo sony and virgin media seemed to be “becoming something of a media mogul bloomberg noted in september  that third point was now “one of mgm’s top five owners according to a person with knowledge of the situation” fanucedit in late  third point took a stake in fanuc a robotics and computer numerical controls firm prior fanuc seldom made direct contact with its investors but in march  the company decided it would start talking to shareholders and return some of its cash to them loeb has met with fanucs president yoshiharu inaba with encouragement from japans government officials who are aiming to shake up companies’ slothful boards ligand pharmaceuticalsedit after ligand pharmaceuticals hired john higgins as its new ceo in

internationaledit in august  third point took a  percent stake over  billion in baxter international in a letter to baxters board loeb wrote that he was “most impressed” by the company’s willingness to consider adding new directors to go along with a new ceo and requested for baxter ceo robert parkinson for two seats on the board baxter reached a settlement with third point agreeing to add munib islam to its board loeb also disapproved of the boards current setup in which directors do not face reelection every year and described it as “shareholderunfriendly and archaic” baxter then agreed to

investors limited is a closedended limited liability investment company registered and incorporated in guernsey it was listed on the london stock exchange in  “we believe that we will be the first us hedge fund to list a single manager fund on the london stock exchange” loeb said  letter about bernankeedit in a december  letter to investors loeb described a recent  minutes interview with federal reserve chairman ben s bernanke as “a staged infomercial rather than a serious interview” in the letter he largely rejected the narrative that bernanke had constructed around the global financial crisis and the feds response to it bernankes “narrative arcposits that the global economy would have collapsed and unemployment would have exceeded levels of the great depression had the fed not intervened to rescue the financial system having set the stage for how we were saved from global financial armageddon once before and therefore ought to trust the fed’s intervention blindly again chairman bernanke’s next chapter states that the fed’s latest  billion market intervention will alleviate our seemingly intractable high levels of unemployment which otherwise would continue indefinitely” loeb complained rejecting bernankes “narrative” as contrary to “certain facts and our own experience – like the feds admitted inability to see the crisis coming or to regulate effectively the banks under its purview” loeb called “bernanke’s devotion to the righteousness of his narrative” “striking” adding that “every actor in the financial system still ought to be asking how things went so terribly wrong” not inventing a narrative “that emancipates one from blame and promises future forecasting precision” loeb warned of “the dangers of believing too much in the stories we tell ourselves” and said that highly placed individual such as bernanke should “be willing to search out facts and admit wrongdoing” at third point loeb wrote “we are truth seekers and problem solvers we must satisfy ourselves with determining ranges of outcomes and potential scenarios rather than searching for and ultimately fabricating absolute truths the only thing we are  percent confident in is that we are fallible we dont have all the answers and we will make some mistakes” fairfax lawsuitedit the canadian insurance firm fairfax financial holdings ltd sued third point and other hedge funds in a new jersey state court in march  charging that loeb lied to investors when he stated that his “decision to short fairfaxrelated positions” was the result of extensive research new jersey state court judge stephan c hansbury granted the summary judgment motions of third point llc daniel s loeb and jeffrey perry in december  dismissing the charges against them “we are gratified that the judge has put an end to this colossal waste of time and resources” said third point describing the case as “a blatant case of forum shopping and a cynical attempt by fairfax to manipulate the judicial system and to intimidate institutional investors who had legitimate concerns about fairfaxs financial position” referencesedit  third point boosts assets managed to about

their profitability and to aggressively leveraging their collaboration with our electronics and service business” one factor in hirais decision was the counsel of advisers who argued “that subsidiary

reserve chairman ben s bernanke as “a staged infomercial rather than a serious interview” in the letter he largely rejected the narrative that bernanke had constructed around the global financial crisis and the feds response to it bernankes “narrative arcposits that the global economy would have collapsed and unemployment would have exceeded levels of the great depression had the fed not intervened to rescue the financial system having set the stage for how we were saved from global financial armageddon once before and therefore ought to trust the fed’s intervention blindly again chairman bernanke’s next chapter states that the fed’s latest  billion market intervention will alleviate our seemingly intractable high levels of unemployment which otherwise would continue indefinitely” loeb complained rejecting bernankes “narrative” as contrary to “certain facts and our own experience – like the feds admitted inability to see the crisis coming or to regulate effectively the banks under its purview” loeb called “bernanke’s devotion to the righteousness of his narrative” “striking” adding that “every actor in the financial system still ought to be asking how things went so terribly wrong” not inventing a narrative “that emancipates one from blame and promises future forecasting precision” loeb warned of “the dangers of believing too much in the stories we tell ourselves” and said that highly placed individual such as bernanke should “be willing to search out facts and admit wrongdoing” at third point loeb wrote “we are truth seekers and

an ally todd q swanson would join the board of massey energy the fourthlargest coal producer in the united states the new york times reported that third point owned  of massey and that loeb had been “feuding with the company for several months” criticizing the management and bringing attention to executive trips to the bahamas las vegas and west palm beach florida on the company jet in one note loeb wrote “masseys ceo is provided a companyowned home to live in  in fact after he leaves the company the house is to be given to him as a parting gift no one else at the company gets free housing much less an entire home as a retirement gift what kind of example does it set when a ceo who makes  million in a single year is given free housing while the company is having difficulty retaining its mine workers” acorda therapeuticsedit in february  loeb asked acorda therapeutics in which third point had a  stake to sell itself to a larger us pharmaceutical firm arguing that a larger company with more experience “would be able to expedite fampridine sr” a multiple sclerosis drug produced by acorda through the food and drug administration fda approval process and into the hands of patients more quickly and efficiently” he argued that if acorda to continue going it alone or to seek partnership with a european firm “would be a tremendous injustice not only to multiple sclerosis patients who should receive such an effective drug in the most expeditious manner possible but also to your public shareholders who have supported fampridine srs development” his letter sent acorda shares up nearly  acorda responded with a statement indicating that its board of directors “continually evaluates ways to maximize shareholder value and to serve the best interests of all shareholders” in may  third point disclosed that it had lowered its stake in acorda to  yahooedit board appointmentedit after third point disclosed its stake in yahoo on september   calling for the resignations of four directors yahoo set up a conference call with loeb jerry yang of yahoo and one of the directors in question roy bostock loeb said that the conversation concluded with “mr bostock’s abrupt unilateral termination of the call” bostock however claimed that he had “said that he had other shareholders to attend to and ended the phone call” loeb informed yahoo ceo scott thompson in a march  letter that third point wanted four seats on the firms board at the time third point owned about  of the firm yahoo sought to compromise by accepting one of loebs board nominees harry wilson a restructuring specialist plus “another candidate acceptable to the two sides” but loeb insisted on being added himself to the board yahoo refused telling loeb according to his own account that “my experience and knowledge would not be additive to the board and that as yahoos largest outside shareholder i would be conflicted as a director  only in an illogical aliceinwonderland world would a shareholder be deemed to be conflicted from representing the interests of other shareholders because he is well a shareholder too” loeb charged that the “boards evaluation of our candidates” made “a mockery of good principles of corporate governance” in response to yahoos charge that third point was a “shortterm investor” loeb responded that “this longterm vs shortterm excuse is a canard and particularly inapt in the case of yahoo if there ever was a company in need of a sense of urgency it is this one” loeb added that the “real issue is not shortterm versus longterm but about board representatives who have skin in the game and will exercise sound business judgment” in a may  letter to yahoos directors loeb noted that according to yahoos filings with the us securities and exchange commission newly hired ceo scott thompson had a bachelors degree in accounting and computer science whereas a simple google search revealed that his degree was “in accounting only” thompson resigned ten days later on the same day loeb wilson and another third point candidate michael j wolf were named to the yahoos board resignation from boardedit marissa mayers appointment as ceo to replace thompson was seen as the culmination of loebs efforts to transform yahoo loeb wilson and wolf submitted their resignations from yahoos board in july  and yahoo bought back  million shares from third point leaving the hedge funds ownership at less than  so the three executives had to leave however the hedge fund gained a profit of  billion marissa mayer issued a statement praising loeb “daniel loeb had the vision to see yahoo for its immense potentialwhile theres still a lot of work ahead theyve given us a great foundation” steven davidoff of new york times observed that yahoo seemed like damaged goods now that it has been abandoned by one of its biggest investors daniel s loeb” noting that yahoos share buyback had “the whiff of greenmail or repurchasing stock to make an investor go away” according to a january  vanity fair profile when loeb told mayer he wanted to sell  million shares or onethird of his remaining holdings mayer stated yahoo would buy back the stock at a guaranteed  per share—but only if he sold  million shares this transaction would bring loeb’s stake below the  percent threshold which meant that he and the other two representatives would have to leave the board loeb also signed a standstill agreement in  that bars him from activist investing in yahoo until  sothebysedit loebs announcement in august  stated that he acquired a  stake in sothebys causing its shares to rise  sothebys announced in september  that it “was considering moves like a share repurchase or raising its dividend” a response to third points having raised its stake in the company the new york times reported that sothebys share price had “climbed about  percent since third point disclosed its increased stake” loeb disclosed on october   that he was now sothebys largest shareholder with a  stake on the same date he announced his desire to join sothebys board and called for the resignation of chairman and ceo william f ruprecht “sothebys is like an old master painting in desperate need of restoration” loeb wrote in a letter to the sec charging that a “crisis of management” at the firm had resulted in “dysfunctional divisions and a fractured culture” as well as “chronically weak operating margins and deteriorating competitive position relative to christies” sothebys main competitor the firm he wrote required new directors and needed for the positions of chairman and ceo to be filled by two different persons not one in a later statement loeb said that “sothebys malaise is a result of a lack of leadership and strategic vision at its highest levels” criticized ruprechts  million salary and chastised the sothebys directors for spending “hundreds of thousands of dollars” in shareholder funds on a single extravagant meal banquet sothebys replied to loeb with a statement maintaining that its “actions as a leader in the global art business have been producing superior results—including a share price increase exceeding the standard  poors midcap index over the one five and ten year periods” adam lindeman of the new york observer in an article headlined “barbarians at sothebys gate” suggested that the “firefight” between loeb and sothebys would “benefit sothebys” a place lindeman described as having “a british clubby feeling of privilege and stuffy pedigree” compared to the “considerably warmer” feel of christies ruprecht announced his resignation in november  sending sothebys shares up around  a day sonyedit loeb criticized the poor performance of sonys summer  films after earth and white house down in a letter issued that year expressing concern that sony ceo kazuo hirai “does not worry about a division that has just released ’s versions of waterworld and ishtar backtoback” loeb proposed a partial spinoff handing about  to  to existing shareholders of sonys entertainment business and even offered to backstop the initial public offering up to  billion to ensure its success “given entertainments perpetual underperformance” loeb wrote “perhaps sonys reluctance to discuss it candidly stems from understandable embarrassment” in addition to asking sony to spin off its entertainment assets loeb sought a spinoff of its financial services division loebs letter sent sony stock up about  at the time third point was sony’s largest shareholder with a  stake sonys board announced on may   that it was considering loebs proposal to spin off its entertainment division “we will engage in thorough discussions at the board level to decide on sonys response  it is an important matter that relates to sonys core businesses and management so the board must hold ample discussions” hirai said the new york times noted that japanese corporations “have a history of ignoring letters from shareholders calling for overhauls” hirai ultimately rejected

million shares of nestlé we hold this stake in our funds and in a special purpose vehicle raised for this opportunity our investment including options currently amounts to over  billion nestlé with an over  billion market capitalization is the largest food business in the world and home to some of the world’s greatest brand s its portfolio including  brands that generate more than chf  billion in sales annually had roughly chf  billion in total sales last year the company operates across a number of advantaged categories including coffee infant formula pet food and bottled water nestlé also has a strong footprint in emerging markets the category and geographic mix of the portfolio is excellent and offers the company a long runway for growth as emerging market customers increase consumption and developed market consumers trade up however despite having arguably the best positioned portfolio in the consumer packaged goods industry nestlé shares have significantly underperformed most of their us and european consumer staples peers on a three year five year and ten year total shareholder return basis one year returns have been driven largely by the market’s anticipation that with a newly appointed ceo nestlé will improve    exhibit a one three five and ten year consumer industry tsr’s   nestlé has fallen behind over the past decade in an environment where growth has slowed due to changes in consumer tastes and shopping habits as well as an influx of new competition from smaller local brands while its peers have adapted to this lower growth world nestlé has remained stuck in its old ways making it impossible to deliver on the once reliable “ nestlé model” that called for   organic sales growth annually and continuous margin improvement as a result earnings per share have not grown in five years this has had a knockon effect on dividend growth which has slowed to low single digits in recent years and nestlé’s  payout ratio now stands at the upper end of the peer group range at  without addressing the company’s stalled earnings further dividend increases will be unsustainable at historical rates while nestlé has stood still its peers have pursued productivity increases aggressively and made other changes in order to deliver earnings growth and create shareholder value in a slower sales growth world third point invested in nestlé because we recognized a familiar set of conditions that make it ripe for improvement and change a conglomerate with unrealized potential for margin    improvement and innovation in its core businesses an unoptimized balance sheet a number of noncore assets and a recent history of meaningful underperformance versus peers it is rare to find a business of nestlé’s  quality with so many avenues for improvement like other investors we are also confident that nestlé is prepared for change because of the company’s  wise decision last year to hire a new chief executive with a high caliber pedigree from outside its ranks for the first time in nearly a century nestlé’s new leader  dr ulf mark schneider had an impressive track record of value creation as the ceo of fresenius a german medical supply company from  until he joined nestlé he delivered strong organic sales growth and executed well on transformational ma and shares appreciated at a roughly  cagr during his tenure as he settles into his role at nestlé we think he has the ability to execute on the kinds of new initiatives the company must pursue however we feel strongly that in order to succeed dr schneider will need to articulate a decisive and bold action plan that addresses the staid culture and tendency towards incrementalism that has typified the company’s prior leade rship and resulted in its longterm underperformance our observations and insights about the company have been bolstered by jan bennink one of the world’s recognized leaders in the packaged goods space who we have retained to advise us on this investment among other roles jan was a successful ceo of royal numico which was the largest baby food company in europe when he became its chief executive at numico jan divested noncore assets and cut costs in order to reinvest in the core business his actions helped dramatically reaccelerate organic sales growth and expand margins before the company was sold to danone for a huge premium he then became the executive chairman of sara lee where he oversaw its separation into two “pure play” companies  a north american branded meat company called hillshire brands and a global tea  coffee company called de master blenders  he then led master blenders until it was sold to the joh a benckiser group sign up to vote on this titleusefulnot usefulclose dialogare you surethis action might not

point llc  park avenue new york ny  tel    april   first quarter  investor letter   review and outlook during the first quarter of  volatility declined and most markets rose in anticipation of global reflation third point generated returns across credit and equity strategies and most sectors through successful security selection and portfolio repositioning new investments during the quarter were initiated primarily in the financials industrials and energy sectors we expect the favorable environment for our investing style to continue for three reasons  corporate activity should pick up as president trump’s tax plans are detailed and enacted  opportunities for activist and constructivist investing are robust and  combining security selection with a reasonable interpretation of the macro continues to be critical while we recognize that we are in the late stages of an economic cycle experience has taught us not to miss the end of an expansive period this is especially true following trump’s election animal spirits matter in markets and despite the obstacles that the new administration will face in passing legislation the overall probusiness environment is in sharp contrast to the last “you didn’t build it” administration’s attitude towards business enterprise and free markets we have been more focused on improving global growth than on the “trump trade” the goldman sachs global gdp forecast for  is  vs  a year ago we are seeing more opportunities in europe because of strong and improving economic data a trend that will likely continue now that the french elections have passed without incident although sp earnings were flat over the past three years we are expecting earnings growth to drive gains and cyclical names to get a tailwind from us policy shifts this year    so what are the risks while we think legislative failure on tax reform could be negative in the back half of this year we are encouraged that bat seems to be off the table there is a risk of inflation catching the fed flatfooted but we see this surfacing later in  or  if at all recent dampening of data in the us particularly in consumer spending has raised a red flag and we will know more when we see q gdp chinese nominal gdp growth has potentially peaked but the main event there will be the change of government this fall and so we expect a muted status quo until then we have actively positioned our portfolio to absorb modest sp selloffs in order to remain aggressive buyers at appealing prices for example we were able to temporarily reduce over  of our equity exposure in advance of the french election at a relatively inexpensive cost of about  basis points we continue to maintain the bulk of our exposure in equities including in several new initiatives where we believe the environment is ripe to take actions to remedy poor performance quarterly results  set forth below are our results through march   third point offshore ltd sp     ytd performance   annualized return

separation of the aerospace unit via a spin off transaction would result in a sustained increase in shareholder value in excess of  billion spinning off aerospace would transform honeywell into an
