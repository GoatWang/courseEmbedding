energy corp tsxv lit  otcqx pnxlf has the option to earn a  interest in the arizaro lithium brine project the terms of the option agreement include mn in staged payments and mn in expenditures over a fouryear period additionally the company must issue mn common shares with certain resale restrictions the territory optioned covers  hectares in the central core of the arizaro salar the largest in argentina and third largest in the “lithium triangle” the whole salar covers an area of  km within a watershed of  km  and is located in the andean province of salta however like many other salares in argentina it has a portion of the pie rather than the whole pie other players with parts of the salar de arizaro are lithium x eramet sentient and remsa an entity of salta’s government volcanic and associated hydrothermal activity is believed to be the main source of lithium and other solutes to the basin this is verified by the deposits of travertine and occurrences of ulexite that have been found as well as the presence of lithium bearing clay hectorite and lithium mica lepidolite in the surrounding areas of the basin the generation of salt deposits has occurred in stages over time earlydeposited halite and gypsum layers that have been deformed by andean tectonic activity are found on the eastern side of the salar the rugged lunar landscape nature of the salar’s surface can be seen below very little historic exploration work has been done on the arizaro salar however the central area is interpreted to have the geologic conditions and thickness to be the most prospective for quality brine resources historical sampling on the western margins of the salar de arizaro show elevated lithium values near surface contained within a classic halite dominant salar much like nearby rincon salar del hombre muerto and atacama projects all of which host advanced or producing lithium brine operations this salar has a prevalence of halite to the west and gypsum to the east these evaporites are covered by surficial deposits along the eastern margin of the salar the arizaro salar benefits from good infrastructure in the puna region and is set to benefit from further development of adjacent largescale mining projects including first quantum’s tacataca copper project and fortuna silver’s lindero gold project salar de arizaro is traversed by a highway and railroad that connect the area to the chile port of anotfagasta some kms west and east to pocitos on the main argentine rail network where natural gas and an industrial park are found the development of brine projects on some other salars in the region has been hindered by a lack of fresh water for processing at arizaro there is a known water recharge area and the company has made securing a water source a key component of the exploration program in order to prepare for a feasible mining project exploration in association with work on the taca taca project holes of approximately  metres depth were drilled into the salar and detected interbedded volcanic material reflecting the volcanic activity that accompanied the evaporite sedimentation the presence of geological structures such as faults and flow channels solutions were also detected however as might be expected these holes were not directed towards establishing the lithium content of the salar until recently little work had been done and the historical references are mainly to a report from the usgs in  which reported date sampling of brines from the subsurface to a mere two metres depth that returned lithium values up to  mgl confirming the presence of lithium in the basin but really only literally scratching the surface argentina lithium’s exploration campaign thus far includes both nearsurface geochemical sampling and a vertical electric sounding ves geophysical survey to delineate conductive zones at depth that may host lithiumbearing brines data from this first stage of the program has been used to define targets for a drill program that is planned for early in the second quarter of  the goal now is exploration for deep layers of lithiumrich brine which are not directly linked to the surface fluids at the arizaro salar this initial exploration program at arizaro was therefore designed to acquire initial hydrogeological understanding of this largely untested salar and to identify conductive zones at depth that may host lithiumbearing brines ves is effective to depths of approximately  metres below which alternative surveys such as controlled source audiofrequency magnetotellurics are required nearsurface fluid samples collected from the trenches returned low lithium  mgl and potash  mgl levels however in the company’s opinion the very large size of the salar and its geomorphology support the potential for discovery of deep brine layers with potential to host higher concentrations of lithium as well as potash the consultants that undertook the ves tests have concluded from the results that as well as the geologic and geomorphologic setting climatic conditions and hydrogeological environment at arizaro when compared to other wellstudied salars including hombre muerto rincón antofalla llullaillaco and rio grande indicate that there is a high probability to find brines at depth with high densities of  to  gl and conductivities higher than  microscm the ves results identified clear targets for an initial drill campaign now three or four holes of up to  metres in depth are planned to test these targets conclusion it’s early days for the companies in the generation x of the lithium wave those from the preceding generation that started out late last decade have moved towards production now it’s the turn of those spawned by the  lithium price surge or those from the previous generation who were thwarted when prices took a tumble and political circumstances deteriorated resulting in wholesale shelving of development plans with a price tailwind a dramatically improved political situation and the deep insertion of joe grosso in the argentine political and economic scene the scene is set for argentina lithium  energy to make advances if the exploration data

search lithium  argentina the development of a lithium project in argentina eramet is developing a project to produce lithium from its deposit located in the andean cordillera of the salta province north west of argentina  meters above sea level  lithium is a versatile metal essential in a variety of endmarket applications such as energy storage which is set to be a key challenge for the next century in  the battery market is expected to represent over half of lithium demand versus roughly a third in  more broadly the global lithium market is expected to more than double in size by  according to analysts and key industry players  the centenarioratones deposit contains a significant level of resources supporting an annual industrial production level of  tons of lithium carbonate for decades eramet has developed an innovative direct extraction process to extract the lithium contained in the brine this process is lowercost and more environmentallyfriendly than the conventional evaporation method of obtaining lithium the proprietary technology was developed by eramet’s leading research and development “rd” center eramet research based near paris france in partnership with the french petroleum and renewable energy institute ifp energies nouvelles in  the eramet lithium project will enter the last phase of its development after two years of development and optimization studies at lab scale and through continuous piloting the direct extraction process will be piloted at an industrial scale this year to finalize engineering studies and qualify the product with our future clients eramet aims to become a major player in the lithium industry before the end of the decade   the centenarioratones deposit contains significant level of resources   a lithium deposit was identified by eramet on centenarioratones salt lake in  exploration campaigns enabled to identify deep lithiumbearing brine resources in volumes and quality allowing an an industrial production of  tons of lithium carbonate for many decades the total surface area of the deposit discovered by eramet spans more than  km and the drainable resource area covers c km with a possible extension to the north of the deposit exploration campaigns identified deep lithiumbearing brine resources in significant volumes and quality supporting an annual industrial production of  tons of lithium carbonate for decades this would represent a   global market share currently  eramine sudamerica sa  subsidiary of eramet owns the mining concessions of the deposit area which cover the right to explore and extract lithium and associated minerals the mining contract with the salta province was signed in april  and covers all phases of mining project exploration feasibility study and exploitation across the whole mine life salta province is an established lithium and borates mining region which ranked  out of  regions all over the world in the  fraser institute’s mining investment attractiveness index lien vers etude eramet’s centenarioratones deposit is fully accessible with limited need for new infrastructure logistics site access and product exporting is done via the existing road network which is used daily by inhabitants and currently producing mining companies in the region an existing natural gas supply pipeline is located km north of the project at pocitos with sufficient capacity to supply the industrial plant fresh water is available on site   an innovative lowcost and environmentally friendly direct extraction process   owning a good quality deposit is necessary but not sufficient to become a significant player in the lithium industry a process suited to the resources of the deposit is also mandatory thanks to its leading rd center eramet research located near paris france eramet has developed an innovative direct extraction process in partnership with ifp energies nouvelles which is well adapted to the resources of the centenarioratones deposit the process is lowercost and more environmentally friendly than the conventional evaporation process used to extract lithium find out the extraction process  eramet’s direct extraction process works as follows the brine is pumped out of the deposit and goes through eramet’s proprietary extraction material which only captures lithium and is insensitive to the other elements contained in the brine the lithiumdepleted brine is sent back to the salar while the lithium trapped in the extraction material is released and then transformed into lithium carbonate through a simple refining process  the direct extraction process presents major benefits compared to conventional lithium evaporation processes and paves the way for a more environmentallyfriendly and economic production of lithium over the coming decades thanks to this process  the deposit is better valued as the process yield is twice the yield of the conventional evaporation process half the lithium resources are then need to produce the same annual quantity of lithium carbonate the hydric balance of the deposit is better preserved because the brine is sent back to the salar after lithium extraction the plant production will be more flexible the production lead time will be significantly reduced compared to the  months required by the conventional evaporation process the plant will require less reagents and less energy will not produce any chemical waste and its environmental footprint will be twenty times smaller than that of a conventional process  the development of a new process is essential because the conventional evaporation process has important environmental and economic impacts it implies high capex levels to build the large evaporation ponds a lithium recovery rate half of that for the direct extraction process a huge amount of chemical reagents required a large amount of residues produced and a major impact on the hydric balance of the salar as the pumped brine is totally evaporated and not returned to the salar   strong commitment to sustainable development and responsible mining   beyond the environmental qualities of the direct extraction process eramet is committed to continue to pursue the highest environmental and social standards within the industry in compliance with its sustainable development policy  eramine sudamerica a owned subsidiary of eramet in argentina maintains a constant and active dialog with all our stakeholders local communities provincial administration and representatives national administration and representatives etc  in addition through various
