executive vice president of new york university discusses trends in higher education and its effects on dental schools and the delivery of dental healthcare inside dentistry’s newest board member james b bramson dds president of bramsoncompany holds an indepth conversation with michael c alfano dmd phd executive vice president of new york university discussing a wide range of topics that reveal the width and depth of these leaders’ many years of experience and wisdom in the clinical profession as well as academia inside dentistry id mike you have a long and varied history in the dental world tell our readers a little about your background and experiences and how they have shaped your perspective over the years ma my education has been a terrific asset in achieving a varied and fulfilling career after completing my dental degree from umdnj i received a phd in nutrition from mit and training in periodontics at harvard during my training in massachusetts i practiced general dentistry part time then i spent  years teaching doing research consulting and managing my own periodontal practice in new jersey in  i became the vice president for dental research at the block drug company now a unit of gsk ultimately becoming senior vice president for global research technology and quality assurance and a member of the board of directors at block i wanted to be working in academia at the end of my career so in  i rejoined the academy and became dean of the college of dentistry at new york university in  i assumed my present position as executive vice president of nyu id what kind of lessons did you learn in industry that you use in your administrative work in education ma going back to academia was intimidating—i didn’t know if my corporate world skills would translate or be valuable to an educational institution it turns out that they were enormously helpful because more than anything i had learned the value of administrative efficiency goal setting team building and prudent budgeting indeed as i think back on my time as dean my most important observation—which i now hold as an axiom—was that great economics builds great academics not the other way around a corollary to this axiom for any deans who might be reading this is a dean with money to spend has a perceived iq that is  points higher than a dean who is broke id i thought your response about the lessons you learned in industry that you use in education was interesting can you expand on that ma i fundamentally enjoy the academic side and i thought the freedom of academics would allow me to create a career that would provide more selffulfillment in the corporate world you have to follow a prescribed direction that comes from the very highest levels of the company however the corporate world can be more like academia it’s not nearly as autocratic as most people on the outside think and you can move much more quickly i remember once interviewing for a position but i was a little hesitant to give up writing grants in areas of interest to me then the ceo asked me “so how long does it take for you to get one of those grants” when i explained that  months would be considered fast he responded “well if you come down here and convince me of a great idea you could be spending that money in  minutes” so that was fairly compelling—and the truth of the matter is that it did happen if they were good ideas you could move on them fairly quickly id what’s the best piece of advice you ever received ma i have been blessed by many mentors along the way but the best advice came from my father when i was a child education is the only thing that can’t be taken from you use it wisely always tell the truth and have the courage of your conviction to stand on the principles you value this question leads me to reflect a bit on leadership there are thousands of leadership programs available today that teach administrative and management skills and help people to build a network however they do not teach key leadership traits like integrity vision charisma passion and perhaps most importantly courage these critical attributes cannot be taught they can only be modeled for others to see—and my father was an amazing role model id speaking some more about leadership do you think the dental schools could do a better job of teaching leadership—emphasizing ethics integrity and those kinds of traits ma i feel very strongly that you can teach administrative and managerial skills but some of the core elements of leadership are traits that i don’t think can be taught—like courage and passion they can be modeled and we have all seen people who are really passionate about issues however i think these leadership institutes as they are frequently called misrepresent their product by all means they can be extraordinarily valuable but i just don’t think you can teach passion integrity charisma and the like id did you look for some of those traits in the students you were recruiting to nyu ma we certainly looked for independent thinkers when we were recruiting students i think that’s one of the attributes of future leaders obviously we looked for integrity but it’s very hard to do this in a setting that basically allows for a single interview at best and a set of recommendations from people who are by definition favorably inclined to be positive id can you tell us about a key challenge or turning point for you ma i could go back to my childhood and talk about growing up poor but hey you’ve heard dozens of those stories i think it would be better to talk about a relatively recent event which proved to be an enormous challenge and perhaps the toughest assault ever on my integrity and courage it began middecade when nyu decided to merge its college of nursing into the college of dentistry we did this because of educational synergies and a recommendation by the institute of medicine urging healthcare providers be educated in teams most importantly it was to explore the idea that if nurse practitioners were affiliated with dentists the  to  million people who visit a dentist—but not a physician—each year would have access to the diagnostic skills and therapeutic intervention of a nurse practitioner leading a dental school with the chance to test a very important model of healthcare intervention that could help the citizenry reduce national healthcare costs and position dentistry even more solidly as a primary healthcare profession was the most significant opportunity in my professional career then the backlash hit suffice it to say that organized dentistry did not take well to this possible innovation at all it reminded me of the way the profession tried to thwart the beginning of the dental hygiene profession in  in ohio yet today there are about  dental hygiene programs in the united states in any case the most difficult challenge for me wasn’t retaining my own beliefs that this model had to be tested but rather the threats made against the nyu college of dentistry it is one thing to go down personally for your beliefs it is quite another to risk an institution that was  years old at the time however with strong support from the university and the encouragement of enlightened leaders in dental education the educational model prevailed has prospered and has even been recognized for its innovation by some of the same organizations that balked at the outset while it remains to be seen if this model will be adopted in private practice it is already making substantial improvements in the quality of education for dental dental hygiene and nursing students at nyu id with regard to what happened with nyu and the college of nursing that’s not an unusual type of approach when a group is faced with something entirely new do you think there is a fear of the unknown that outweighs those opportunities that come from change—and that’s why people fight so strongly against change ma yes i think that’s always the case it’s a cliché to say that change is hard but because everyone operates within a comfort zone once you create some parameters that might require people to work outside that zone there’s an uneasiness that the outcomes won’t be beneficial so i wasn’t surprised that the profession—particularly the new york state dental association—would have concerns about what we were doing what surprised me was the almost venomous nature of their approach to understanding it—and i am being kind when i say “venomous” they wanted to kill it sight unseen without understanding any of the implications they saw it as an assault on the integrity of the dental profession truth be told some considered the dental profession to be at a higher level than the nursing profession and therefore any comingling of faculty or the name of the institution by definition would draw down its reputation it was an extraordinarily difficult time—but not because i couldn’t take the heat i was concerned that they would also harm a venerable institution that would damage not only the people who worked there and graduated from there but also the profession because i believe it’s important that private research universities continue to want dental schools in their sphere of control had it gone badly one could see that nyu might back away and maybe even give up on both dentistry and nursing that would have been a huge tragedy—all because we were inspired by what could be if people would have an open mind about letting it take its course id it seems that in a lot of these instances you have to deal with the doubt i always hear “we don’t know the unintended consequences of our actions here” how do you counter that ma it’s difficult because the comment is true unintended can also be “unknown” consequences and it’s very difficult to play out a move all the way down the chessboard to see what other consequences might come into play basically we thought we were on solid ground in terms of being consistent with both accrediting agencies’ requirements also with the idea that what we expect from an institution of higher education is the ability if not the downright mission to innovate across all that it does including educational paradigms at a time when costs of dental education were spiraling up—as they always do—the thought of leveraging faculty in certain effective ways was attractive simply in terms of the academic model as i said that’s not what drove the university to do this—what drove the university to do this was the idea that this just might be a new way to create access to healthcare for people who don’t normally visit a physician we do know there are millions of people with these chronic diseases who could benefit from earlier diagnosis the thought of being able to intercept before the disease becomes more difficult to manage was the compelling idea that we wanted to evaluate id higher education is under some assault these days—lack of affordability questions about value decreased outside funding and the list goes on what do you see as the major challenges in higher education in general ma this is a very timely question higher education is under significant assault these days with costs escalating at near double the inflation rate for the past  years americans have had about all they can take as we say at nyu the higher education reset button has been pressed getting into specifics on this would try the patience of your readers suffice it to say that institutions of higher education in the united states have already begun to employ many of the techniques of the corporate world using tools like reengineering restructuring outsourcing rightsizing and the like so far the efficiencies at most institutions have come behind the scenes but change is likely to come to the academic components soon indeed in some state systems and smaller private colleges academic changes replete with faculty furloughs partnerships with “for profit” educational entities and increased teaching loads have already begun perhaps most importantly the days of tuition increases at twice the rate of inflation are over id well if it’s about the need to learn more about new skills and efficiencies and business modeling can you tell me what’s at the root of that is it lack of incentive is it tenure what are the forprofit universities doing and are they building a better business model to educate people ma i think one of the signature problems for higher education is that it often doesn’t recognize who its stakeholders are so if you ask a group of academics who the stakeholders of the universities are the most common answer would be “the faculty” i’ve asked that question so i can say this with some experience there are some members of the faculty who would say “the students” that’s a pretty darned good answer and i think that’s the level at which the forprofits are operating—and i believe that’s an appropriate level to be operating at the bigger picture for the notforprofits is that the stakeholders i believe are the citizens there are about a half dozen substantial tax breaks that are offered to notforprofits and the expectation by society is that it derives value by allowing those institutions to prosper just a little bit more than if they have to pay taxes for a few hundred years now that model has delivered excellent value for the american citizenry in more recent years which i would define as the last four or five decades the cost has been escalating at rates that—to use a popular buzzword—are not sustainable increasingly the attitude of the american people is that this is just out of control at the institutional level in some ways higher education looks a bit like healthcare what do i mean by that it’s very hard for individuals to assess the value of what they have just purchased you know if you like your physician or not you know if he or she is personable you don’t know for sure if they are proffering the best kind of care for you or if they are doing this surgical procedure at the highest skill level but they believe that they are and you have to trust them so too with education you are going on reputation for example do you like the geography do you like how the tour guide functioned and so forth not every reputation is important but that’s part of it then you factor in the way these services are paid for for the vast majority of americans healthcare is paid for by third party payers typically supported by the corporations that create the payrolls in higher education it’s also largely subsidized by third parties in the form of grants directly from the university or various scholarship programs along with highly subsidized loans that are made available through the federal government with some state participation as well therefore it’s very hard to judge the quality of the product or the service that is being purchased while you are receiving it also there is less concern about the typical spending habits of individuals because you are not writing a check or opening your wallet to pay for it when you have scenarios like that—and you throw in some of the other issues like the expense and constant change of technology on which they are highly dependent—it’s a recipe for very rapid escalation of cost there’s also a bit of star power involved—medical centers strive to get the biggest best names in surgery onto their faculties so too with universities and that tends to escalate salaries id would you agree that the ongoing economic climate is not going to support those kinds of subsidies ma absolutely as i mentioned before the reset button has been pressed the state of massachusetts for example introduced a bill that begins to tax all the endowments over  billion and there are  of these across the state they’re not happy with the way the institutions are returning the growth on those endowments and also they need tax revenue the city of pittsburgh proffered a tax on tuition for all the universities in the city to pay as one vehicle to solve its budget problems and the us senate directed the irs to investigate institutions of higher education to ensure they are not abusing their taxfree privileges from these examples you can get a sense there is a pretty high level of dissatisfaction with that aspect if you were to survey american voters on how they feel about us higher education they would say it’s the best in the world we’re so happy we have it we’re a better country for it so they’re not really assaulting the universities for what they have done but for how they have done it and how they have paid for it we just took the lowest tuition increase in  years—so we’re adjusting to that we’re putting pressure on faculty salaries trying to operate the institution at a smaller spread between the tuition increase and the salary increase traditionally at nyu there has been a two points’ difference if tuition goes up  salaries can go up  now with tuition going up  where can salaries go well they can’t increase more than  but clearly if they go up only  you run the risk of not being able to recruit or retain faculty so you need to compress that difference we have tried to do that by making the business part of the university more efficient id based on your experiences and outreach and the major challenges to dental education and dentistry how do you see the profession responding ma when i left the dental deanship and nyu recruited charles bertolami a very talented leader to replace me i deliberately tried to remove myself not only from the nyu dental school but also from active participation in the profession—although i retain membership in the ada however while things have gone very well at the school that is not the case with the profession and i have been slowly drawn back to observe and comment because i care too deeply about the profession that has afforded me such a fulfilling career troubling trends are developing in both the educational and the practice arms of the profession of dentistry if you were to assess how dentists moved from barber surgeon tradesmen to highly respected professionals most would conclude that the signature change came when the educational component moved from apprenticeship through proprietary schools to universityaffiliated dental schools—especially affiliations with research universities since the early th century there has been a healthy mix of dental schools affiliated with research universities and those sited at less researchintensive parent institutions the balance in the numbers of research intensive and nonresearch intensive dental schools is shifting with essentially all of the new schools affiliated with institutions that are not researchintensive to be sure these new schools usually have distinguished leaders and they all endeavor to bring something important to the table communitybased learning and service education in collaboration with other health professionals sharp focus on recruiting particular types of dentists and so forth however i believe that the last dental school to open within a researchintensive university was the university of florida in —almost  years ago thus while good outcomes can come from establishing new dental schools at nonresearch intensive institutions these  or so newly opened or planned schools are creating an imbalance between those based at researchoriented parent institutions and those sited at other types of institutions to make matters worse the researchoriented schools are concerned that they will be at a competitive economic disadvantage because sustaining a research enterprise comes with significant associated costs they are also concerned about maintaining growth in the science base of dentistry and sustaining the esteem of the profession thus they recently convened a group of some  schools in the midwest to ponder the situation while the concerns of the leaders of such schools are understandable the discussions that took place would have been better at a national meeting with all dental schools in attendance dividing the small enterprise of dental education into subgroups of schools would be a huge mistake this is a time for more dialogue collaboration and understanding—not less the american dental education association showed great leadership a few years ago when it invited all components of dental health education to the table for membership in contrast the risk of creating multiple “affinity” groups of dental schools is high and dental education in the united states will not be well served by such divisiveness finally we should all consider why such great institutions as harvard columbia and michigan were pleased to welcome dental schools onto their campuses more than  years ago but stanford chicago and yale would be unwilling to do so today id why wouldn’t a stanford or chicago or yale want to have a dental school ma i have an answer but it’s difficult to state i think that in the eyes of stanford the profession of dentistry has lost esteem maybe  years ago had the opportunity availed itself to stanford it would have had a dental school but i think it’s extraordinarily unlikely that they would today i just had a discussion with the president of a very prestigious university who said they’re not sure that dental schools can contribute to the kind of academic dialogue that they would like to have on their campuses this is very disturbing when it looks like the nation needs  more dental schools and not one of them is going to be sited at what most would agree is a reasonably intensive research institution i know of two researchorientated institutions who have danced with the possibility of creating a dental school one was rochester which is a fine institution that would have loved to have started a dental school and the other was texas tech which is less wellknown but growing in research stature if we can get just a few of these places to agree that it is appropriate to initiate a dental school then my concerns are mitigated substantially the fact that there have been none i find to be a very worrisome trend id since you are concerned about whether this movement is going to retard the advancement into scientific frontiers in dentistry—will there still be that drive in research with that assumption why hasn’t industry stepped in to replace what goes on in research institutions ma i think it’s fair to say there are many other ways that dental science can be advanced other than a dental school doing the research in fact i think  of the nidcr budget goes to nondental institutions so there is no question that the science can continue to advance but the worry is where will the passion for the value of research to the profession come from if not from dental professionals who have been schooled in the value of research and who have the potential to contribute you could argue that a school with no research capacity can teach the value of research but if there are no schools actually doing that research it can become a very shallow exercise particularly over the profession as a whole id should we be concerned about conflicts of interest in industrysponsored research ma one obligation of dental education is to teach how to properly read and understand the literature and part of evaluating the literature is to understand the origin and design of a particular study so corporate research per se can be every bit as valuable as—or sometimes more valuable than—research funded by foundations private philanthropists or the federal government however sometimes research becomes very productspecific and is not as valuable in terms of advancing the profession i think there’s good and bad research regardless of the sponsor—that’s the way i would look at it as a recipient of public grants i would look someone squarely in the eye and defy them to show that i used a lesser standard in those studies than i did with nih support but there’s no question the reason we disclose the source of the monies is so people can assign a value to it and be appropriately suspicious or not about whether there is any inherent bias id when you put your ear to the ground what are you hearing these days ma my network isn’t quite what it used to be but what i do hear troubles me in addition to the problems in education that i just mentioned i understand that divisiveness is in the air within organized dentistry having failed to learn a lesson from the way the dental therapist issue in alaska was managed it seems unable to craft a workable solution to address the public cry for better access to dental care indeed as we talk there are at least two groups of state dental societies meeting separately to discuss alternative approaches to access one group seems to be focusing on how best to deploy a socalled “midlevel dental practitioner” within the context of the current dental healthcare delivery system i have had the opportunity to speak to this group and they seem to be taking a responsible approach to a very difficult problem the other newly formed group may be taking more of a position to preserve the status quo this approach did not work in alaska did not prevail in minnesota which seems to be moving forward in a progressive manner and it typically fails to offer a viable alternative to increasing access to care i understand the ada has scheduled a meeting on this topic this summer and i hope that it can catalyze healthy discussion that will not simply create a legal or a pr strategy but a more broadbased approach that actually begins to deal with the problem of access it is difficult to be optimistic but i have my hopes for this to be successful id one of the duties of that leadership is to make sure that people see hear and understand both sides now regarding lack of access to dental care it seems that there are new players new parties—specifically organized patient advocacy groups—who are somewhat changing the debate they are increasingly vocal how do you see the new players beginning to change the debate or maybe the strategy ma excellent point i think that brings us full circle to the comments i made earlier about who are the stakeholders of the universities once again we are talking about the citizenry if we have learned anything about the way this country works it’s that ultimately the citizens have a great deal of power it may take them a while to understand the issues but once they do they will throw people out of office they will lobby aggressively for different kinds of legislation i think we are seeing that happen now dental care has been on the horizon for upwards of a decade as a major issue motivating the citizenry the fact that it took some time is not surprising it always does but now that there have been some successes by such lobbying efforts i think we will inevitably see more the momentum behind this has been pentup for so long it’s a problem that’s going to find a solution id specifically how do you see the access to lack of dental care dilemma being addressed ma there is no doubt that in the long run the american public will get the access to dental care that it desires—and deserves i think that it is inevitable that a midlevel dental practitioner or dental therapist or an advanced dental hygiene practitioner will arise on a statebystate basis the only question is whether or not the dental profession will elect to embrace these new models and bring these new practitioners into the current model of dental care a well conceived framework for the role of dental therapists can be good for the public but also good for dentistry the arrival of such practitioners will allow the dentist to focus more on diagnosis the management and treatment of difficult cases and the expansion of the role of dentistry as a primary healthcare profession nurse practitioners and physician assistants have proven to be very useful in medicine and a dental version of nps and pas would most likely be effective too indeed such models have been successful in highly developed countries for almost  years perhaps it is time to get this right in the united states id where do you see the next great opportunities for the dental profession oral–systemic associations medical model of care new delivery models salivary diagnostics ma i think each of the areas you mentioned is ripe for expansion but at rates that are very likely to disappoint the avantgarde thought leaders in the profession dentistry is traditionally a late adopter of new pharmacotherapeutics in fact it has always struck me as a bit strange that the dental profession primarily uses stainless steel and carbides to treat its signature infectious diseases—caries and periodontal disease—while the rest of the healthcare world uses pharmacotherapy as a principle mode for infection management although recent developments in salivary diagnostics are fascinating i do not see the dental profession deploying them widely to the extent that for example systemic cancer can be detected in salivary analyses the use of such technology will bypass the dentist and be utilized directly by physicians and nps id is the problem with adopting some of the new technologies deliveries or diagnostics really the reimbursement system we have that rewards proceduralbased care ma that is the most significant part of the problems although there are other reasons it could really be how dentists view themselves do they view themselves as primary care providers do they view themselves with full authority to write prescriptions for whatever the patient’s oral health seems to warrant—smoking cessation prescriptions for example or to help medicate patients for a given periodontal disease or do they see themselves as surgeons who basically use only a handful of drugs—anesthetics analgesics and antibiotics—in order to effect technical treatments in the oral cavity why is the dental profession disproportionately treating infection with stainless steel because it sees itself primarily as a surgical profession there is nothing inherently wrong with that but we once used surgery to eliminate ulcers and now no one has ulcer surgery anymore by using methods that might not be the most costeffective or the least intrusive dentistry will miss the opportunities to manage the diseases that we are entrusted to treat id it seems as though the medical models that are really showing promise—like kaiser and those types of models that are designed around teams wellness and total care—have found ways to adopt best practices and analytics outcome measures and report cards that help them understand better ways for measuring what they are really doing do you agree ma i think you’re right the hope is that these practicebased networks can deliver that for dentistry they are expensive to run and controversial but i think the need is there there are many more of them in medicine of course and they are designed to get realworld data on exactly the things you are talking about id nyu is very engaged in higher education on a global scale can you comment on the global dental environment ma dental education like higher education in general is going global twentyfive years ago only a few us dental schools entertained the graduates of foreign dental schools for advance standing now it has become commonplace when i was dean of dentistry at nyu and had the opportunity to travel internationally i marveled at how many dental offices displayed the nyu torch in their windows as a sign of pride and perhaps for some competitive advantage showing that they had been trained in the united states recognizing that the united states does not have a monopoly on talent nyu is building an interconnected network of campuses that is very different from the typical study abroad programs in the global network university that nyu is becoming people from around the world can enter at a site and receive an nyu degree—yet never set foot in new york at the moment this programming is primarily based in arts and sciences education law and the performing arts but all of the professional schools at nyu including dentistry will definitely be a part of it going forward id as a reader i would say okay but what kind of implications does a global dental environment have for joe dentist on main street if any ma i think that as in the rest of the world there is a likelihood that they will have colleagues who were not born in the united states and ultimately as the world globalizes i think that people in other countries will expect to have colleagues who were born in the united states we’re barely at the threshold of free and easy movement of scholars and professionals around the world i think it’s inevitable that it will happen we certainly see it in higher education we see it in the corporate world where talent is recruited regardless of where it might originate i think the profession is well behind that curve and we don’t see that happening in a widespread way except for the number of schools that now offer programs with advanced standing for graduates of other dental schools there were four or five of them  years ago now there are  schools that offer some type of advanced standing that has changed significantly and i think it is helping id if you could change one thing about dentistry in the united states what would it be ma stop killing the messenger the dental profession has been changing slowly for  years it will continue to do so reflexive narrowminded defense of the status quo will not stop change—it never has it may slow it down but it will not stop it moreover in the effort dentistry takes on the look of a selfserving trade group not a public healthminded profession and the oncehigh esteem of the profession will fall further in the minds of the populace id what frontiers are left for you and where are your next challenges ma i hope to “retire” in the next year or two to spend more time with my six grandchildren i also hope to be able to get more active in dentistry again perhaps by writing consulting and teaching finally i have joined some notforprofit boards and hope to make some contributions to those organizations id any final comments ma i appreciate the opportunity to participate because the things i have been hearing are just so bothersome to me and i don’t want us to go backwards i wrote an article for nexus called “dentistry circle back circle the wagons or circling the moment” the idea of circling back—which i didn’t make in this interview—is the extent that all the new dental schools are not affiliated with research institutions by the way the vast majority of these schools will take exception to that because they define research differently so i understand that phrase will be controversial but i worry that dentistry evolved from barber–surgeon to apprenticeships to proprietary forprofit schools to university settings not that there are propriety schools yet in dentistry but you can see that almost around the corner once we go there in my opinion we are drifting back towards trends that are very very unhealthy about the interviewees michael c alfano dmd phd was named
