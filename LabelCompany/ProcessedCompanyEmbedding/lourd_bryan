page continue reading the main story los angeles — when talks over the walt disney company’s attempted sale of miramax films bogged down last month bryan lourd a managing partner in the powerful creative artists agency jumped inmr lourd who represented a bid organized by bob and harvey weinstein and the investor ron burkle worked phones rattled cages poured on charm when things got sticky and lobbied the disney chief executive robert a iger — until talks fell apart and disney moved on to the next prospective buyerit isn’t easy being a superagent these daysmr lourd’s clients are behind perhaps a dozen of the biggest studio movies this year like robert downey jr in “iron man ” or oliver stone with his coming “wall street money never sleeps” but mr lourd in close coordination with his business partners has been pushing to expand creative artists — already heavily involved in the sports business — well beyond the confines of the entertainment industry which has not been much fun of late even for the big playersin the last few weeks mr lourd and his agency partners — kevin huvane richard lovett david o’connor rob light and steven lafferty — have talked with potential investors including the private equity firms kohlberg kravis roberts and tpg advertisement continue reading the main story the idea is to form a financial alliance that might give creative artists backing for new ventures whether in sports video games or the sort of investment activities it has fostered through evolution media capital a satellite that represented the weinsteinburkle bid for miramax continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story the sale of a stake in the agency could also let its owners tap some of the wealth that has largely been locked inside their sprawling private business but people briefed on the discussions — who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the agency’s stringent policy against public comment on its business — insisted that no managing partner was planning to leavehollywood’s top agencies have been under pressure for years as an erosion in home video revenue a drop in film production and fragmentation in the tv business have clipped income for stars and filmmakers and turned deals like the stillpending miramax sale into bargaining quagmires“the caa conversations are nothing more than a reflection of these realities” said peter dekom a longtime entertainment lawyer photo the hollywood agent bryan lourd left with james schamus the chief of focus features at the cannes film festival in may credit michael bucknergetty images for focus features for mr lourd and his associates a group of whom bought creative artists from its cofounders michael ovitz and ron meyer in  the challenge has been to keep their company from becoming a gilded cage that might shrink if it failed to connect with a larger business worldmr lourd declined to be interviewed for this article he has however unwillingly become the most public of his agency’s private group of owners in large part because of an unsuccessful marriage to the actress and writer carrie fisher who made their relationship grist for book projects including her memoir and onewoman stage show “wishful drinking”mr lourd meanwhile has emerged as a main strategist behind the agency’s search for new backing any deal with kohlberg kravis roberts tpg or another investor could still be months in the makingbut talks toward what might elsewhere be seen as a hohum step in business expansion have been an attentiongetter in hollywood perhaps because creative artists and its owners have been long cloistered in a world that revolves around the agency’s century city headquarters advertisement continue reading the main story mr lourd for instance is virtually alone among the partners in having joined a major corporate board — that of iacinteractive corporation the internetoriented conglomerate led by a hollywood friend barry dillerhe also sticks out in hollywood because of his humble background and downtoearth demeanor the son of an oil field worker mr lourd now  grew up along the bayou teche in new iberia la he came to los

lourd quickly became an agent was tagged as an upandcomer then jumped to the hotter creative artists in ms fisher born to hollywood’s inner circle as the daughter of debbie reynolds and eddie fisher brought still deeper connections though mr lourd was already building a client list that included meryl streep robert redford and brad pitt photo richard lovett president of creative artists agency credit elaine thompsonassociated press mr lourd joined his partners in  in battling mr ovitz who had begun wooing clients to his new management company disinclined to share business with mr ovitz the agency said anyone he managed would be shut out of creative artists the ovitz operation soon foldedwith mr huvane primarily focused on talent relationships mr lourd and mr lovett who is the agency’s president and chief organizer have at times appeared to be an operational committee of two at the top of creative artists despite a group ethic that puts the partners on equal footingmr lovett has been known for a special interest in the agency’s foray into sports marketing as it recruited prominent agents who represent the likes of lebron james and peyton manning the initiative — now managed by howard nuchow michael levine and peter kenyon but heavily overseen by mr o’connor — has led to tensions with the competing sports agency imgin april img filed suit in a united states district court in ohio against matthew baldwin a sports agent it accused of taking confidential files including client contracts when he recently quit to join creative artists advertisement continue reading the main story mr baldwin had already sued img in california seeking to void contractual terms that would keep him from competing with it the two courts are now sorting out where the cases will land perhaps setting the stage for a battle that could touch creative artists though it is not named as a party to either suitdeep inside the movie business at any rate things sometimes still go the way they should for a top playerengineering a new version of “the karate kid” for sony pictures entertainment for instance was mostly a matter of getting one of mr lourd’s own clients the producer jerry weintraub who made the original film to talk with a client of mr lovett’s will smith“he said don’t close your mind” mr weintraub said of mr lourd’s role in brokering the deal behind a film that has taken in  million at the domestic box office in its first  daysand harvey weinstein remains a believer even if miramax — for the moment — slipped off the hook“he is a levelheaded and fair negotiator”

all hate any out and proud gay manby anonymousreply  hes hung like a squirrel cut and his spooge tastes like asparagusby anonymousreply  with amazing amyby anonymousreply  he is greatby anonymousreply  is that his husband on the rightby anonymousreply  the herbert ross troll said lourd was known to be gay at the time that he married carrie fisher in the late eighties many powerful gay men entered into beard marriages to distance themselves from the taint of the aidsravaged gay community the most significant being calvin kleinhis partner bruce bozzi is an aging himbo who appears to be more in love with his best friend andy cohen than he does his actual partnerby anonymousreply  lourd also infamously told carrie fisher that her craziness turned him gay although again per the hrts anecdote that was clearly not the caseby anonymousreply  this is interesting but does it mean carrie was okay with marrying gay man why would she do thatby anonymousreply  bruce bozzis instagram much discussed and derided in these quartersby anonymousreply  isnt he bff with another dl fav simon hallsby anonymousreply  bryan lourd and bruce bozziby anonymousreply  lourd and halls were roommates at usc and have been close since although i have heard halls is more of a sycophant than bff when amazing amy personally emailed halls to congratulate his husband matt bomers performance after watching the normal heart halls replied im proud of matt and ryan but im really proud of bryan lourd he made this whole thing happen we had fun with that onehere is what hrt said re lourd and fisherokay heres what i dont get this woman was hollywood hipster before such a word existed she was hollywood royalty her whole life she knew everyone and nobody told her her soon to be husband was gay because i knew he was gay and i was just a pimple on the toe of show business but not her know how i knew my boss told me years before and not in some bitchy queen way either just matter of fact the guy was family and quite attractive so if i and i assume a few hundred other people knew then how could she notby anonymousreply  was he ever married to carrie or did they just cohabitate i know they had a daughter her only child shed be in her s by nowby anonymousreply  he is the most interesting man in the worldby anonymousreply  goop looks terrible in that pic at r jesus her skin is like leather there and the fake tan atrociousby anonymousreply  goop looks like a normal person there not overly botoxed waxy and plastic like most hollywood idiotsby anonymousreply  r thanks for clarifying that and posting the hrts quote i am always shocked by nonlesbian women who deliberately choose to enter bearding marriage were they even that close i think not if he is openly criticizing her and blaming her illness for his sexual orientationby anonymousreply  r more like that bitch cunt amy pascalby anonymousreply  his boyfriend bruce is like  but acts and dresses as if hes in his s and that really knows what to do with it by anonymousreply  quotewas he ever married to carrie or did they just cohabitate i know they had a daughter her only child shed be in her s by nowthe daughter is an actress she is one of the chanels on scream queens i know lourd identifies as gay now but with the whole wife and kid thing wouldnt the most likely deduction be that hes a bisexual who prefers menby anonymousreply  by anonymousreply  one of my best friends mother and lourdes mother have been friends since childhood in new iberia la she knew him in high school according to her he dated girls back then but was not surprised when he came outby anonymousreply  the children of gay men who entered into bearded marriages must often wonder if dad had been able to live truly as himself i would never have been bornby anonymousreply  his daughter and her friends will always know since hes mister hollywood that hes gay and that he fucked carrie fisher billieby anonymousreply  whats the deal with him and ryan murphyby anonymousreply  he is ryan murphys agentby anonymousreply  r you know a lot dude are you in the biz with hollywood scumby anonymousreply  client jonathan groffby anonymousreply  his partner

wouldnt be surprised if she was a lesbianby anonymousreply  lourd is supposedly an incredibly nice guy his brother blaine is a bigwig financier and recently wrote a memoir about growing up in cajun country very well reviewedhe pretty much raised billie on his own as carrie was so whacked out very devoted dadby anonymousreply  its funny how billie lourd looks exactly like himby anonymousreply  r she doesnt pings at all or had any gay rumors didnt sheby anonymousreply  uh shes starring on scream queens on fox rby anonymousreply  back when he was dating carrie and had hair looking like a complete different manby anonymousreply  no one had him no rumors of any flings are we to believe he stays faithful to the same wannabe ish guyby anonymousreply  with clooney they would make a great

bryan had an affair poor mattby anonymousreply  walker bryan halls is the child matt bomer fathered so that adds a wrinkleanyway it is highly likely being roommates in college that simon and bryan have slept with each other at least onceby anonymousreply  lourd is supposedly an incredibly nice guyhon no one gets to where he is in hollywood by being an incredibly nice guy im sure hes as much a nasty barracuda as any of his peersby anonymousreply  i think that person meant nice as in coolcharismatic rather than nice nicethe hrt said that the caa guys had that reputation in the s as opposed to the other hotheaded agenciesby anonymousreply  look in hollywood they can stab you in the back and destroy you but smile all the while they are calm and happy and always always helpful guys like bryan lourd would be the fixer type the problem solver the guy whos gonna take care of you he can be as unscrupulous as can be but you wont see it the guys who succeed are the ones who never telegraph their punches you dont know your throat is slit until you nod your headdealing with actors authors directors sports figures singers etc these are all very insecure narcissistic people to varying degrees some are more needy than others by being nice and being a good listener you learn things people share information they confide producers talk about how they need to find financing etc sometimes a project can get sabotaged by being greenlightedits all very alice in wonderland nothing is as it appears and no one says what they mean the most effective ones are like pacinos character in scarfaces memorable line i always tell the truth even when i lie the days of temper tantrums and moguls are over the trend towards hollywood nice began in the late s s amy pascal is an example of someone who stupidly let her guard down with rudin there are different rules for women rudin is an acknowledged asshole but he is represented by a nice guy and his nice guy has powerby anonymousreply  producers and agents are apples and oranges producing has always tended to attract tyrants and control freaksby anonymousreply  how does he get along with debbieby anonymousreply  who cares r dating lol yea right youre gay bl always were and billie knows itby anonymousreply  i think nice means he is pleasant keeps his temper under control is very intelligent and urbane in his memoir bryans brother described how it was bryan who let their impossible and homophobic father move in with him the father became disabled and bryan looked after him like a little kid despite how awful he had been to bryan sounds like a good guy to meby anonymousreply  not so nice he has only ever let the old man watch cant stop the music and my rs breckinridgeby anonymousreply  grandmother mother and

contingent of workers searching addis ababa for a green meteor that might prove fatal to the worlds greatest heroby anonymousreply  billie accepted debbies honorary oscar earlier this fall because debbie was ill truth is debbie is suffering from dementia  you could tell last year from her rambling speech during her sag life achievement award and cannot be trusted to speak in public anymore carrie keeps her at home while billie is sent out as the family spokesperson now and did you see billie in the new star wars as the young leiaby anonymousreply  thanks for ruining a clever bit from the movieby anonymousreply  quote are the rumors about carrie being bipolar trueshes openly discussed her bpd i recall she even joked about the state of her liver due to the medications she now takes and her past drug abuseby anonymousreply  isnt he the nd biggest agent at caaby anonymousreply  the look of fondnessloiurd actually looks better without hair or at least the limp style he wore when he dated carrie fisherby anonymousreply  r correct hes nd in command behind richard lovett lovett learned the value of being low key from ovitz tenureby anonymousreply  i thought kevin huvane is the top dog at caaby anonymousreply  richard lovett is presidentby anonymousreply  in what level of hell is ovitz working these daysby anonymousreply  r i dont recall any scenes with young leiawho did billie lourd really playby anonymousreply  carrie fisher must know whos gay in hollywood since her exhusband and john travolta probably slept together thats how carrie fisher knowsby anonymousreply  r she played a female rebel with no family ties to leia whatsoever just an extraby anonymousreply  r probably as bryan is a hung top and travolta is a big bottomby anonymousreply  for some reason i thought huvane and lourds were lovers i dont know where i got that ideaby anonymousreply  bumpby anonymousreply  are bryan and bruce married and whats the deal with bruces daughter is she their daughter or did bozzi come into the relationship with herby anonymousreply  for someone so powerful he cannot help his daughter land better roles than in some cheap ryan murphys showby anonymousreply  amen rby anonymousreply  quotein what level of hell is ovitz working these daysits my opinion that ovitz is nobody anymore and i mean nobody hes a man without a country now and seemingly very few friends ive observed him as late as summer  or  in east hamptonas a houseguest to someone not really in show biz he sat around barely saying anything with a sad vacant look on his face i believe he and his wife judy have since split i mean after his career making enemies and his huge flame out what is left but ignominyby anonymousreply  he is one of my best friendsby anonymousreply  bryans a decent guy stands out like an angel amongst those at his level in the agency business he keeps a relatively low profile you wont see him with  questionable west hollywood skanks on a boat in greece like kevin the husbands instagram thirst notwithstanding but he and kevin make a nice power gay duo yin yang etc theyll both cash out soon enough at caa when the private equity money vestsby anonymousreply  bump given recent newsby anonymousreply  is he a known homosexualby anonymousreply  yes you big damn dummy he married a manby anonymousreply  according to wikipedia carrie oddly claimed she  bryan were

cochair of caa for  years hes a very powerful but very lowkey gentlemanly southern guyby anonymousreply  re r richard lovett must be older than dirt i thought he was eased out years ago and the dynamic duo took overr hes a hollywood agent at a major packaging firmaka asshole right up there with the lawyers and artist managers the surface however courtly is irrelevant they all have a thick layer of dissembling shellac hiding the moral rotby anonymousreply  he has a very nice smile he reminds me of someone but i cant think whoby anonymousreply  why in gods name is the daughter of this very powerful man not to mention with her maternal pedigree bearding for lautner and on that terrible showby anonymousreply  r because she’s not pretty or talented enough to not have to play the gameby anonymousreply  at what age did lourds daughter actually start acting in tv or moviesby anonymousreply  r being raised by gays billie might prefer a gay husbandby anonymousreply  i always get the impression that lourd halls bozzi and cohen all fuck each other a big perv familyby anonymousreply  bozzi posted this photo of his daughter with the halls boys note the astonishing physical resemblance between the girl and the oldest halls boy on the right i will bet you anything they are halfsiblings conceived using the same egg donorso yes there is a closeness between the two familiesby anonymousreply  lourd  bozzi were among the close family that attended simons and matts wedding bozzi said lourd had tears in his eyesby anonymousreply  bruce bozzis tribute to his

exclusively at the beginning of cocktails at lincoln centers alice tully hall for the american songbook gala that honored him  and raised  million dollars twice as much as it ever has but i couldnt turn them down its a great institution and i couldnt say no am i embarrassed yes am i nervous about giving a speech yes i will have a good time tonight  when this is over and i can just hang out with my friends i have no idea what were going to see tonight  and im not sure i want to know they kept it a complete surprise from me not an easy thing to do particularly if youre represented by caa and this man has a lot of friends they came from los angeles warner bros sue kroll and blair rich both in dolce  gabbana david geffen barry diller ron meyer amy pascal bryans brother blaine lourd and wife crystal moffet lourd in chic tom ford white silk reese witherspoon and jim toth matt bomer and simon halls lourds college roommate from louisiana lourds proud mom who flew in for a few days and of course new york lourd was feted with a surprise performance organized by other caa agents and by theater director joe mantello  it featured anne hathaway sarah jessica parker alan cumming broadway star norbert leo butz marisa tomei patricia clarkson allison williams ellen barkin kristen chenoweth andy cohen kelly ripa and mark consuelos matthew broderick was on the playbill but is shooting a film and could not get away much to his regret uta client gwyneth paltrow was in the audience in a chic black sequined cocktail dress with long sleeves im just a guest tonight she laughed im not singing in this crowd witherspoon also wore a black cocktail dress a valentino with an illusion neckline im loving everything valentino does these days she admitted and kevin huvane who runs caa with lourd was patting everyone on the back bryan is my brother he pronounced in the most heartfelt way it seemed to be the sentiment of the evening jimmy fallon wafted through the crowd at the dinner after only to be congratulatd every two seconds for his impending tonight show debut all the songs performed on stage monday night were odes to broadway and new york with the event set in what was said to be a recreation of lourds manhattan penthouse who knew that one of films and tvs biggest agents was such a theater lover turns out he is a fan of show tunes plays musicals the works the actors on stage were all situated on sofas and divans with a bartender bringing them cocktails as if they were latenight crooners in a new york jazz club marias crisis in the village is apparently lourds fave while those who can croon did hathaway of course but who knew allison williams could sing so well cummings performed a broadway tune as did parker but the biggest surprise of the night might have been lourds yearold daughter nyu student billie lourd daughter of lourd and carrie fisher now blonde and longlegged who sang a duet with bomer neil youngs old man word is shes thinking of taking her obvious musical talent seriously when she gets out of school tomei spoke about lourd living in her building in new york and him being wise enough to read her soul in the elevator and bryan she added can i have a ride home tonight if not see you in the elevator i am ellen barkin said the actress now a diehard new yorker as she strode onto the stage in a chic black silk trousers and blouse ensemble and i am bryan lourds best friend of course he has many best friends everyones his best friend it would make me mad if he wasnt so wonderful i do have a lot of best friends lourd admitted after daniel craig presented him with his honor after the songs were sung its embarrassing but i love all of them i didnt want to do this but im really glad i did a louisianastyle dinner of shrimp and mac and cheese was served after in the lobby of alice tully hall facebook twitter email me print comments merle ginsberg email protected merle comments comments powered by disqus caas bryan lourd confirms talks of stake buy  hollywood reporter the hollywood reporter caas bryan lourd confirms talks of stake buy  pm pdt  by elizabeth guider  ap facebook twitter email me print comments kohlberg kravis  roberts eyeing  mil stake in agency so what about outside capital in your agency caa managing partner bryan lourd was asked tuesday after news broke that kohlberg kravis  roberts is in talks to buy a  million stake in the firmlourd more or less confirmed the talks with the investment firm while speaking at the beverly hills hotel during a summit on luxury goods sponsored by the financial timesthere have been conversations he told the  marketing and ad agency execs though he never mentioned kkr by name its premature to say weve selffinanced so far and we did ok in the credit cruncheven so all talent agencies have felt the downdraft from the recession and seen their commissions from talent deals squeezed and in  icm ceded a substantial majority share in its fortunes to private equity player rizvi traversewhatever the challenges of the representation biz one thing lourd did suggest more forcefully was that he and his partners would as he put it never turn over control it is lourd went on the passion the family we all chose along with  he halfjokingly added  our other dysfunctional ones at homelourd also volunteered that many people in private equity and the investment community who are much smarter than we are could if the right fit came along play a role in expanding the sphere of the agency  but always in a minority position ft editor lionel barber did not press lord on the issue and the minute conversation then shifted back to the topics at hand  namely how major brands are increasingly getting in bed with hollywood to get their messages across and how stars and celebrities are responding to these new challenges and opportunitiesfor one thing lourd pointed out certain actors understand their responsibility toward those who invest in their artin the old days lourd noted actors would go quietly off to europe or asia to do sponsorships or endorsements but now they more fully understand the value of real longterm partnerships with companiesendorsements can further an actors agenda for companies the need is for actors to be front and center to have stock to experience the product in order for the relationship to be authentic in the eyes of consumers the client has to really show up lourd saidas for other growth areas of the agenting business lourd put the accent on caas fouryearold expansion into the sports arena which now includes representation of such athletes as peyton manning derek jeter and lebron james to get that division going caa hustled to hire a passel of powerful sports agents from the sports rep firm img and started to put together sponsorship deals among athletes corporate clients and sports teamslike movie stars top athletes want to know from us how to manage the business around their gift he said and that he continued involves extensions into other fields such as broadcast anchoring philanthropy and real estate the caa partner also said there will be much more back and forth between the film world and the sports world pointing to director alejandro gonzalez inarritus recent deal with nike or between stars and products that reflect their passions and styles as with george clooney and omegaanyone who ghettoizes any form of media is a fool weve all got to throw away our playbook and start over lourd said facebook twitter email me print comments elizabeth guider email protected thr ap email protected thr

that i had turned him gay    by taking codeine again and i said you know i never read that warning on the label i thought it said heavy machinery not homosexuality  turns out i could have been driving those tractors all along  sadly our first reaction to the allegation — thats so gay — has been deemed verboten by hillary duff instead then we wonder whether lourds gay pill theory could explain all

completely shutdown on aug   this page provides access to the last available data dump read more data dumps are a downloadable version of the data in freebase they constitute a snapshot of the data stored in freebase and the schema that structures it and are provided under the same ccby license the freebasewikidata mappings are provided under the cc license freebase triples freebase deleted

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
