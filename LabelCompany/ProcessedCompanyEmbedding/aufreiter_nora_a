nora a lawver teri l lun candace d read preview article excerpt for traditional marketers organization means structure distinct product channel and customer groups but newstyle marketing organizations understand that boxes and lines structures cant drive value in fastmoving environments as the marketplace evolves ever more rapidly marketers struggle to keep pace their traditional stratagemsredesigning market segmentations building strong brands and hiring cadres of marketing managerscontinue to be necessary but unless those solutions can be mobilized rapidly many marketers could find themselves overtaken by their competitors for a fundamentally different way of organizing companies to exploit opportunity seems to be emerging among many growth leaders you might call them venturemarketing organizations vmos since like venture capitalists they are quick to spot new possibilities to allocate resources to the best ones and to cut their losses as they go such groups realize that to outpace the market consistently they must not only create fluid organizational structures but also provide for unyielding rigor in measurement and decision making as a result they enjoy revenue growth rates that on average are one and a half times those of the competition exhibit on the next page incumbent or attacker alike they are capturing more than their share of market opportunities stay fluid when traditional marketers think of organization they mean structure distinct product channel and customer groups focusing on specific functional tasks such as brand management customer segment management and market research functional managers play the pivotal roles in these functionally focused groups which are responsible for generating ideas and taking them to market but the traditional approach hinders the fluidity required to keep pace with the markets evolution for when market priorities change traditionalists take a wreck and rebuild approach that consumes the precious time of top executives disrupts action on the front lines and worst of all often fails to yield the intended results sixtyseven percent of respondents in a watson wyatt survey  said that in most cases the complex and confusing changes companies passed through during such reorganizations did little to improve their performance newstyle marketing groups understand that formal structures cant drive value in fastmoving environments to make organizations keep pace with the market these groups rely not on periodic restructurings but on a continual process of evolution vmos do have designated managers for core products segments and channels but the number of these managers the scope of their responsibilities and the people to whom they report evolve constantly to reflect changing opportunities at dell computer for instance the incentive system rewards marketing managers who successfully identify and capture so many market opportunities that some of their business must be passed on to other managers divisions divide into smaller and smaller units and profitandloss responsibility spreads out among more and more managersan approach that encourages all of them to turn the needs of their customers into products and services as quickly as possible first usas credit card unit is another organization whose strong growth over the past few years has been propelled by the new approach it has few solidline reporting relationships new positions are created above beside or below their predecessors and new people are constantly being placed in shared resource poois which are constantly reconfigured dynamically although first usa has had performance problems since being acquired by bank one the phenomenal earlier growth rate of the credit card issuer was propelled
