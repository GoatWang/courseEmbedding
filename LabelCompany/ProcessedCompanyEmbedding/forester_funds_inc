forester capital management             why hedged equity investing at forester our main objective is long term capital growth  we believe long term performance is enhanced by focusing on downside protection during unfavorable market conditions or times of increased volatility the fund invests in undervalued stocks and also uses put options and cash to vary exposure to the market when the portfolio manager feels a defensive position is warranted over the long term we believe our hedged equity strategy has been successful in the last four down markets in    and  the fund has reported positive returns   performance data quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and when sold your investment may be worth more or less than its original cost performance current to the most recent monthend may be lower or higher than performance quoted and can be obtained by calling  performance for periods less

market products the fund is managed by a professional asset management team mutual fund pricing and performance i am interested in equity funds mixed asset funds taxable bond funds tax exempt funds prospectuses  reports fund pricing  performance go why mutual funds foresters financial has long advocated investing in mutual funds as a key component in building a diversified investment portfolio mutual funds are comprised of a basket of securities such as equities bonds and money market instruments and thus offer the benefit of builtin diversification when you invest in a mutual fund you essentially pool your money with other investors who have similar goals and allow a professional asset management team to make the underlying investment decisions about dozens of securities most people cannot afford to buy on their own    please note diversification and asset allocation do not guarantee a profit nor do they eliminate the risk of loss of principal our philosophy taking the longterm view today too many individuals and investment firms concentrate solely on shortterm performance at foresters financial weve always stayed focused on the long term for more than  years—through several wars recessions and countless bull and bear market cycles—weve consistently provided guidance to help our clients reach their longterm financial goals   our conservative approach to investing means that regardless of what goal youre saving for—owning a home sending a child to college or funding your retirement—we encourage a longterm approach to investing this in fact is the timeframe our mutual fund portfolio managers have in mind when they choose investments for the funds they manage here are some of the other goals we follow in managing our funds   we respect risk at all times our appreciation for risk underlies all of the investment decisions we make we take fund performance very seriously while we strive to have as many of our funds as possible in the upper half of their respective peer groups we dont take on the risks that are necessary to be at the top of those groups were willing to miss the biggest gains in bull markets we dont think its prudent to take the risks that are necessary to achieve those gains   we seek lower volatility for our funds volatility is the enemy of longterm investors at foresters financial we  believe that using a longterm strategy is the best way to achieve your financial goals to help you stay on track to reach those goals we try to minimize volatility as much as we can what types of mutual funds are available foresters financial offers the first investors family of mutual funds which contains a wide variety of fund options to meet your shortterm and longterm investing needs you can use individual funds or

your complete investment program they generally carry a moderate level of risk and are well diversified examples of core funds include growth  income total return and investment grade  noncore funds carry a higher degree of risk but can be a good way to diversify a portfolio or to achieve a specific investment objective international and global are noncore funds that can give you access to growth opportunities outside the united states whether youre a novice or an experienced investor whether your goal is to provide a comfortable retirement fund a college education increase current income save

significantly below the intrinsic value of the company we view these stocks as bargain stock and seek to purchase the best bargain stocks in each market sector this diversifies the portfolio while

the funds financial statements because the financial statements include only the direct operating expenses incurred by the fund not the indirect costs of investing in other mutual funds example this example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the forester value fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds the example assumes that you invest  in the fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of these periods  the example also assumes that your investment has a  return each year and that the funds operating expenses remain the

such as commissions when it buys and sells securities or turns over its portfolio  a higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account  these costs which are not reflected in annual operating expenses or in the example affect the funds performance  during the most recent fiscal year the funds portfolio turnover rate was  of the average value of its portfolio principal investment strategies   the fund invests in the stocks of large us companies that it believes are undervalued and have

capitals estimate of the amount a buyer would pay to own the entire company  forester capital performs its own fundamental analysis of the company   the fund places special focus on companies whose current market prices are low in relation to earnings and have great appreciation potential in addition to stocks with low prices relative to earnings forester capital also considers factors such as the following about the issuer · booktomarket value · pricetocash flow ratio · pricetosales ratio · earnings estimates for the next  months · fiveyear return on equity under normal market conditions the fund invests at least  of its net assets at market value at the time of purchase in the common stocks of large companies that have market capitalizations greater than  billion  the fund may emphasize sectors more or less than the sp   the fund may also invest in stock index options   the fund may sell a stock when forester capital thinks the stock is too expensive compared to forester capitals estimate of the companys intrinsic value changing circumstances affect the original reasons for a companys purchase a company exhibits deteriorating fundamentals or more attractive alternatives exist market exposure  in order to try to enhance returns the manager may vary the funds exposure to the overall stock market  the manager may reduce market exposure when the manager believes that the overall stock market is highly valued or that market conditions warrant it  during these defensive periods the fund may invest some or all of its assets in stock index options money market funds us treasury or us agency fixed income instruments with a maturity of less than five years principal risk like all mutual funds that invest in stocks the forester funds take investment risks and it is possible for you to lose money by investing in the fund  the managers ability to choose suitable investments for the fund has a significant impact on the funds ability to achieve its investment objective  the principal factors that might reduce the funds return include stock market risk  the fund invests primarily in common stocks and other equity securities  over time stocks have shown greater growth than other types of securities  in the shortterm however stock prices fluctuate widely in response to company market economic or other news value investing risk  from time to time value investing falls out of favor with investors  when it does there is the risk that the market will not recognize a companys improving fundamentals as quickly as it normally would  during these periods the funds relative performance may suffer emphasize a sector  if the fund has a higher percentage of its total assets invested in a particular sector changes affecting that sector may have a significant impact on the funds overall portfolio varying market exposure  if the fund is in a defensive or offensive position the fund may not go in the same direction as the market and the funds performance may suffer largesize company risks   the fund normally invests the majority of its assets in larger companies  larger more established companies may be unable to respond quickly to new competitive challenges like changes in consumer tastes or innovative smaller competitors  also larger companies are sometimes unable to attain the high growth rates of successful smaller companies especially during extended periods of economic expansion options risk   the primary risks associated with options investments are  the risk that changes in the value of the investment will not correlate to changes in the value of the underlying security which may result in imperfect hedging of a portfolio position  options are more volatile than stocks and therefore may be subject to disproportionately larger gains or losses and   the risk that the use of an option strategy to enhance the return of a portfolio will fail with negative consequences to the fund  put options may not go in the same direction as the market and the funds performance may suffer  accordingly the fund will limit its exposure to options to  of the value of the portfolio based on the cost of the options at any one time fixed income risk   the primary risk associated with fixed income are  the fixed income instrument may not go in the same direction as the market and the funds performance may suffer  interest rates may rise reducing the principal value of the instrument and  the credit rating of the us agency instrument may materially differ from a similar us treasury turnover risk  portfolio turnover refers to the rate at which the securities held by the fund are replaced the higher the rate the higher the transactional and brokerage costs associated with the turnover which may reduce the funds return unless the securities traded can be bought and sold without corresponding commission costs  active trading of securities may also increase the funds realized shortterm capital gains or losses which may affect the taxes you pay as a fund shareholder  shortterm capital gains are taxed as ordinary income under federal income tax laws an investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic or any other government agency because of these risks the fund is a suitable investment only for those investors who have
