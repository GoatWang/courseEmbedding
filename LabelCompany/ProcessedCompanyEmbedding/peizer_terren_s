achieved the stock dropped  on the day of the announcement the stock has drifted further south to  off  from its week high from peizers resignation prometa citicismedit it was peizer’s half brothers struggle with addiction that spurred him to found the prometa treatment program in  and launch hythiamincin  peizer capitalized the company with in excess of  million in capital prometa combines three medications as a treatment for substance dependence which became known as the prometa treatment protocol the medications involved are all fda approved combining them for addiction treatment is different from the purposes for which they were individually approved this is known as prescribing medications for offlabel use more than  percent of all prescriptions prescribed by physicians are written for  offlabel use peizer was successful in getting hythiam listed on the nasdaq global market exchange using a technique peizer has used many times before and has become wall streets leader in the reverse merger or reverse public offering rpo hythiams treatment went on to help thousands of patients end their dependence and get better peizer and hythiam caught the addiction industrys eye for not waiting until there was enough scientific proof that hythiams treatment was truly effective subsequent studies have since validated hythiams and peizers claims in july  hythiam and peizer gained their first heath plan customer health plan of nevadainc  joining ford motor company and the united auto workers in its adoption of hythiams catasys integrated substance dependence treatment solution peizer still envisions hythiams treatment methodology being deployed throughout the nation hythiam gained some notice for its  ad campaign featuring deceased comedian chris farley with the slogan it wasnt all his fault alluding to his death from a drug overdose the company paid  to farleys estate in order to use his image this advertisement campaign garnered national attention as peizer became a fixture on the american news circuit regularly appearing on national news syndicates such as fox news cnn good morning america the today show and cnbcs squawk box and mad money despite questions about its tastefulness and criticism from addiction treatment providers for advertising direct to consumers peizer defended the campaign as creating awareness about addiction as a medical disease not a social and psychological personality disorder other critics focused on the companys emphasis on sales over research that would establish the validity of prometa especially since the fda restricts marketing of drugs to the purpose for which they have been approved peizer justified the companys approach in a  minutes episode as providing information about the treatment protocol to physicians since hythiam does not market the medications directly to consumers the physicians in the practice of medicine then prescribe the medications to the patients in needthe fda allows physicians to prescribe all fda approved medications off label in the practice of medicine addiction experts marveled that peizer was exploiting a nuance and loophole referencesedit

to update you our valued shareholder on the exciting events occurring throughout our business and will be taking steps to provide additional visibility into our progress going forward the rapid pace at which we are expanding our engagements with the major us health plans has dramatically increased the total number of equivalent lives we are reporting at the end of  this growth is expected to have a significant impact on our financial performance for  the healthcare industry in particular health insurance companies and plans typically take many years to allow a new entrant such as us to gain significant traction it has taken the company several years to prove out our business model as it is currently accepted by many national health plan providers during this time we have found it virtually impossible to have enough visibility in our business to publicly provide accurate financial guidance and direction through this letter we hope that you will sense something must be changing given our newly communicative posture further we will briefly discuss our vision the healthcare industry issues that we are addressing the proprietary nature of our products the scalable nature of our business and our near term expectations company vision and solution the company’s vision is to improve the behavioral health industry by providing an innovative proactive treatment solution with cost saving opportunities for health plan customers and ultimately be able to scale its availability on a national and perhaps one day international basis today we are focused on substance use disorder sud depression and anxiety which comprise approximately  of behavioral health disorders the us currently has a passive system whereby treatment avoidant patients cost denial stigma access need to seek out treatment gain access to treatment afford said treatment and then receive the appropriate care that addresses both the physiological and psychsocial aspects “integrative care” of these complex diseases unfortunately the more severe patients we serve have these diseases as comorbid conditions of each other and have other comorbidities such as cardiovascular diabetes renal liver disease etc the average amount of costs associated with these patients directly related to the behavioral diseases alone is  these costs are predominantly from emergency room visits and inpatient hospital stays catasys provides an integrated outpatient solution with proprietary analytics and predictive modeling proprietary enrollment engagement and modification of behavior techniques our solution effectively turns the passive system treatment avoidant minimal access to care unidentified patient population to a proactive replicable scalable national solution where we focus on the complete care of the patients the results from our solution have shown that patients are getting better and the health insurance companies are consistently saving  of the medical costs for each patient enrolled hence there is a health plan incentive to pay for all the associated treatment costs through ontrak behavioral health patients now have full treatment program coverage increased access to treatment and effective care first quarter and full year  catasys has emerged as a leading healthcare analytics company providing proprietary valueadded care for health plan members we are like “amazon and uber” to the standard facilitiesbased behavioral health industry model as we are virtual and scalable throughout the country utilizing provider networks of independent contracted medical doctors and psychologists companioned with our own care coaches in an outpatient setting all of our existing health plan customers including humana aetna centene and hamp have expanded ontrak to their other products and expanded geographically we are now operating in  states with more to come this week we have seen for the first time that one of our customers expanded from our sud ontrak program to the ontrak treatment of sud depression and anxiety while we have been growing revenues significantly yearoveryear and sequentially the numbers are quite small relative to what we expect in the coming year and beyond we have worked through much of the customer specific logistical issues in  that limited our revenues and it appears that the “perfect storm” is beginning to culminate in the first quarter of  “perfect storm” we anticipate shortly that all of our existing customers will be operating at or near full capacity for the lives under contract by the end of the first quarter of  with additional opportunities to expand we expect this growth to come throughout their eligible members including medicare medicaid commercial individual and hopefully tricare military and veterans as well as expansion throughout our depression and anxiety offerings it’s important to note that when a health plan contracts ontrak for depression anxiety and sud it represents an approximately x increase of the eligible population from which we enroll we began the year with at or under  enrollment rates of eligible lives we are constantly trying to improve our techniques and we are beginning to see the results while we are only one quarter in we are currently seeing a  enrollment rate which exceeds our expectations another input to the “storm” is additional health insurance contracts we expect to add more national and superregional health plans this will be a major impetus to revenue growth excitingly we expect many of the new contracts to include the treatment of depression and anxiety these will be the first instances of new customers contracting for all three disease states we are hopeful that in  we will have contracts in place with health plans that represent in excess of  of the commercially covered lives in the usa we are hopeful that we will have contracts with  of the  largest health plans in the country importantly all of our existing and future customers will continue to benefit from the trend in place and expected to accelerate with the next administration of more of the medicare and medicaid populations moving to managed care these populations have an approximately x the eligible patients from which we enroll than a commercial population unfortunately another “tailwind” is the increasing rates of mental illness in the us in a survey released this week one out of six adults take psychiatric medications alarmingly  of them are prescribed multiple refills this is indicative of rising dependencies and associated medical costs the government increasingly recognizes the us mental health problem and has instituted the mental health parity act and this week the st century cures act became law thereby improving us mental health efforts the result large projected revenue streams we believe that in  we will nearly triple our equivalent lives els under contract from the current  million we have in place each  million els is anticipated to equate to a cash receipts run rate  months from launch of  million hence  million els could translate to a cash receipts run rate of approximately  million  months from launch excitingly this is only the beginning and would expect significant revenue and cash flow growth rates for years to come we are extremely excited for catasys’ future growth i certainly hope that you can sense my excitement for the coming years perhaps now you can understand why i personally invested in excess of  million into catasys inc thank you for remaining dedicated to our company’s vision which will hopefully transform the behavioral health industry i wish you a happy and healthy holiday season and a tremendous new year for all catasys shareholders respectfully terren s peizer founder chairman  ceo catasys

continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story wall streets terren peizer is like woody allens zelig he shows up in some of the oddest placesa decade ago mr peizer was michael r milkens lefthand man and later a star witness against mr milken at his sentencing for securities fraud in the mids mr peizer played a small role in the convoluted drama surrounding towers financial the debtcollectionagencycumpyramidscheme founded by steven hoffenberg and he was an investor in several small companiesnow mr peizer has turned up as the president of holliseden pharmaceuticals inc a fledgling drug company with a stock that has soared  percent this year to  on friday while biotechnology stocks have been making something of a comeback lately the nasdaq index of these shares which includes holliseden has risen just  percent this yearwhile hollisedens market value  million might seem big for a company with no sales much less earnings mr peizer is passionate about the prospects for its antiaids drugs and he is a persuasive salesman this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for me he said last week we have something specialif he is right ultimately nothing else about holliseden will matter much but similar hopes are shared by the investors in many of the hundreds of little biotechnology companies out there not all of which are quite as quirky as holliseden  and only a few of which will probably hit the big time advertisement continue reading the main story unlike many biotechnology companies holliseden has not been vetted by a big brokerage firm that wants to take it public or a big pharmaceutical company that wants to be its partner though mr peizer hints of a partnership deal ahead continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story the company was founded in  by richard b hollis who had worked for several medical companies and patrick t prendergast an irish scientist dr prendergast had previously financed his research by treating race horses mr hollis said adding that he had focused on a commercial perspective rather than an academic one patents awards versus publishing papersin its first year and a half in business holliseden devoted itself to trying to raise money according to statements it filed with the securities and exchange commission in november  it found a big source of  million in cash the initial acquisition corporation which had gone public in  as a blind pool wall streets shorthand for give us the money now and well buy a company to be named later the underwriter was h j meyers which has a history of regulatory problemsa year ago mr peizer joined holliseden mr peizer who had at first been interested in investing in the company spent months checking it out he said meanwhile the company was looking into mr peizerobviously someone with as high a profile as terren we had to do the same thing mr hollis said he was comforted by the fact that mr peizer had never been sanctioned by the securities and exchange commission he said adding i became very very comfortable and very confident in terrens ability as a businessman and financiermr peizer developed his high profile in his s when he became a salesman at the beverly hills office of drexel burnham lambert where he sat next to the man he describes as the babe ruth of the bond business though he worked with and admired mr milken he said he felt compelled to testify against his old boss when he discovered that improper things had been going on and i wouldnt perjure myself i wouldnt obstruct justice and i

investor in small companies he says he has made money in almost all of the roughly  companies in which he has invested some like the shoe company now called candies are making money others like urethane technologies a tire company have gone bust i shouldnt have left the board he said of urethane they ran it into the groundin  mr peizer had another unpleasant brush with publicity when he was named in a lawsuit filed against john hall the man who was supposed to rebuild the remains of towers financial renamed qualis care instead mr hall looted the company he later pleaded guilty to fraud chargesqualiss creditors complained that the companys money was used to repay a  million personal loan mr peizer made to mr hall who used an additional  million of company money to buy stock from mr peizer mr peizer has asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit against him saying that he had nothing to do with mr halls improper activities advertisement continue reading the main story all of these experiences mr peizer said have made him leery of the limelight the sour light the lemon light but he was willing to take the rather public role at holliseden he said because he believed so strongly in the companys drugsin a press release the company issued last week it described three technology platforms it was working on including a drug called inactivin or ppb which it said kept viruses from replicating using a different mechanism than current aids treatments the company hopes to begin overseas clinical trials on this drug by the end of march and to start such tests in the united states before the end of the yeareven so the company is probably a number of years away from applying for approval from the food and drug administration said dr thomas c merigan a prominent aids researcher at stanford university who is on the companys board and is serving as a consultant to help it set up its clinical trialsas for the runup in the stock price he said i dont understand the ways this happenscompany officials say they are not behind the rise despite the press release they have been trying to keep a low profile they say and they do not think a brokerage firm is pushing the stock indeed no analysts now cover the company which plans to hold a road show for stockbrokers in new york this weekmr hollis and mr peizer suggested that the current boom in trading might have occurred because in december early investors who owned millions of shares became free to sell them but mr peizer and mr hollis own almost half of the companys shares  mr peizers first block of stock options just vested  and say they have not sold anynor do they intend to mr peizer said i would throw myself on the tracks he said if it would help this company continue reading the main story we’re
