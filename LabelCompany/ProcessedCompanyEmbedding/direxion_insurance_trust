investments logo     facebook twitter pinterest direxion investments logo new york may   prnewswire  the direxion shares etf trust ii has decided to liquidate and close the direxion daily gold bull x shares ticker bar exchangetraded fund the fund based on the recommendation of direxion asset management llc direxion the funds sponsor due to the funds inability to attract sufficient investment assets direxion believes the fund cannot continue to conduct its business and operations in an economically efficient manner as a result direxion concluded that liquidating and closing the fund would be in the best interests of the fund and its shareholders shares of the fund will stop trading on the nyse arca inc and will no longer be open to purchase by investors after the close of regular trading on june   shareholders may sell their holdings in the fund prior to june   and those transactions may be subject to customary brokerage charges between june   and june   shareholders may only be able to sell their shares to certain brokerdealers and there is no assurance that there will be a market for the fund during that time period on june   the fund will liquidate its assets and distribute cash pro rata to shareholders who have not previously redeemed or exchanged their shares these payments are taxable and will include any accrued capital gains and dividends the funds net asset value will reflect the costs of closing the fund as calculated on the liquidation date the fund will close when the distributions are complete the process of closing down and liquidating the funds portfolio scheduled to take place between june   and june   will result in the fund not tracking its underlying index and experiencing an increase in cash holdings these developments may not be consistent with the funds investment objective and strategy for more information about the liquidation and termination process please contact direxion investments at  for media inquiries please
