direction right whether you’re a bull or a bear direxion is with you our leveraged etfs are powerful tools built to help you magnify your shortterm perspective with daily x leverage go where there’s opportunity with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade and stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets leveraged and inverse etfs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage they seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day they are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments target index the russell ® index ruintr measures the

strong over the oneyear period with the russell  index rising over  and the morningstar small growth funds category increasing more than  in comparison the fund rose  over the oneyear period ended march   the fund focuses on highquality companies that have a history of solid consistent growth in earnings and stock price typically avoiding highflying cyclical growth stocks in strong market rallies generally with returns of  or more the fund may lag its small growth peers however over the long term we are pleased that the fund’s riskreturn profile remains strong in comparison with its peers in the morningstar small growth category the fund is the only fund out of  funds with an “above average” performance and a “low” morningstar risk rating for the   and  year periods ended march   what areas of the market does the fund typically avoid the fund often avoids stocks with a heavy exposure to economic cycles such as commodity chemical or metals companies homebuilders and airlines in addition the fund generally holds an underweight position in the volatile biotech industry as of march   the fund had a  weighting in healthcare stocks the morningstar small growth fund category average was nearly  the stocks that meet our criteria of a longterm track record of consistent growth tend to be companies possessing desirable proprietary products and services with competitive advantages that give them greater control over their own destinies historically the fund’s smallcap holdings have attracted interest for example in january  mars inc purchased fund holding vca inc in a move to boost its petcare division vca has a network of nearly  animal hospitals and veterinary diagnostic labs that serve  clinics and day care centers for dogs the acquisition plays on the growing trend of increased consumer spending on gourmet pet food and medical care as a result of the acquisition vca was a top performance contributor for the fund in the first quarter would you please discuss a sector that the fund generally favors the fund tends to hold a higher percentage of companies in industrials sector compared to peers as of march   the fund held a  weighting in industrials compared to less than  for the morningstar small growth funds category in the industrials sector we seek highquality companies that not only have solid consistent growth but also operate in markets that tend to be less sensitive to business conditions examples include companies that focus on waste disposal or pest control and maintenance what factors should investors consider when selecting smallcap funds for their portfolio in rising markets many investors tend to focus on absolute performance without much regard for risk we believe it is important that investors account for the amount of risk being assumed to generate those returns the fund was built to play both offense and defense placing emphasis on riskadjusted returns over time we believe the fund’s strategy helps moderate the
