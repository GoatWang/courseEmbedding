from praesidium investment management company llc new york aug   prnewswire  praesidium investment management company llc praesidium or we on behalf of its clients beneficially owns approximately  million shares of tibco software inc tibco or the company and today sent the following letter to tibcos board of directors  praesidium has a longterm multiyear investment horizon and frequently interacts with management teams and boards of directors to propose constructive strategic ideas  august   board of directors tibco software inc hillview avenue palo alto ca  dear members of the board of directors thank you for your recent letter to praesidium investment management company llc praesidium stating that the board of directors the board will meet with us  as constructive longterm shareholders we look forward to further providing our views and analysis to our board representatives we were happy to read in the wall street journal that tibco software inc tibco or the company has started to reach out to potential acquirers  we support the companys exploration of a potential sale as a way to maximize shareholder value   however the article states that the talks are not part of a formal process and are being spearheaded by tibcos ceo vivek ranadive  we strongly believe that a rigorous formal process is required in order for the board to make a fully informed decision in good faith regarding whether a sale a standalone strategy or another alternative is in the best interests of the companys shareholders  in order to avoid conflicts of interest we think that it is imperative that the board form a special committee of independent directors and that the special committee engage with an investment bank and legal advisors  a rigorous independent sale process is the only way to provide directors with sufficient unbiased information to make a decision on a possible sale transaction  in  reuters reported that talks broke down with a potential strategic acquirer of tibco and bloomberg later reported that chief executive officer vivek ranadive held out for a higher bid telling the board he could get the stock to the proposed price range without a takeover   we do not know the details of those discussions however we believe the special committee should include at least two members who were not on the board when tibco apparently rejected those overtures  we believe david west as the longest tenured board member not included in those  discussions should head this special committee  praesidium has done an extensive analysis of tibco and its products and our work shows the company has an excellent product set in some of the highest growth areas of software  given the strategic importance of the rapidly growing data discovery market and spotfires leading technology in this area combined with the highquality technology portfolio that tibco possesses in the growing application infrastructure middleware marketplace we believe that there would be a number of potential strategic acquirers for the company in both the software and hardware spaces  further we believe a strategic acquirer could pay a sizable premium to the current public market valuation and after synergies earn very high aftertax cashoncash returns on an acquisition we believe the board has an opportunity to create a significant amount of value for shareholders through a formal and well run sales process  praesidium as a large longterm tibco shareholder would be more than willing to assist the special committee in pursuit of maximizing value for tibco shareholders  we intend to provide the board our analysis and views on who we see as the potential strategic acquirers and how tibcos products would fit with each  best regards praesidium investment management company
