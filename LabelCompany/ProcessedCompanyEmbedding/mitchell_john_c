courseware an innovative platform that expanded to support interactive video and discussion courseware served as the foundation for initial flipped classroom experiments at stanford and helped inspire the first massive open online courses moocs from stanford that captured worldwide attention in  the office of the vice provost for online learning was as established in august  after mitchell served as john l hennessys — stanford universitys th president — special assistant for educational technology and chaired a faculty committee that established initial priorities for stanford and developed intellectual property guidelines for publicly released online courses to help build faculty experience and a catalogue of online material vice provost mitchell launched a faculty seed grant program in summer  this program has helped faculty across campus transform their stanford campus courses and release public courses to the world generating informed discussion and debate among faculty in the process in addition to supporting delivery of digital course content the vptl engineering team is working to expand the features of lagunita stanfords instance of the opensource release of the edx platform mitchell and his team in partnership with edx announced the release of open edx in june  an opensource hosting platform providing a customizable alternative for all colleges and universities and supporting open educational research and innovation stanfords online courses are generating a wealth of course participant data in collaboration with stanford centers of scholarship such as the lytics lab which is jointly supervised by mitchell and mitchell stevens and candace thille of the graduate school of education vptl is playing a key role in evaluating educational outcomes and improving online learning based on datadriven research and iterative design in may  mitchells team issued a comprehensive report to share benchmark information with other institutions of higher education mitchell holds a bs from stanford university and a ms and phd from the massachusetts institute of technology mit he has served on the editorial board of ten academic journals acted as consultant and advisor to numerous companies and spent sabbaticals at the newton institute for mathematical science and coverity inc mitchell is the author of two books over  research papers and is among the mostcited scholars in computer science researchedit together with gordon plotkin he noted the connection between existential types and abstract data types mitchells early computer science research focused on programming analysis and design where he played a pivotal role in developing type theory as a foundation for programming languages a view that is now dominant in the field for the past  years his research has focused on computer security developing analysis methods and improving network protocol security authorization and access control web security and privacy mitchell has been at the forefront of web and network security research and education for more than a decade and has helped train thousands of students in programming languages and hundreds of expertlevel professionals in the area of cybersecurity his efforts have resulted in the development of concepts used in the popular java programming language improved the security of widely used wireless networking protocols contributed to the security architecture of the chrome browser and other components of the modern web in august  mitchell was appointed by stanford president john l hennessy as
