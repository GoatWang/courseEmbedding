paradoxes may fit into more than one category because of varying definitions of the term paradox some of the following are not considered to be paradoxes by everyone this list collects only scenarios that have been called a paradox by at least one source and have their own article although considered paradoxes some of these are based on fallacious reasoning or incompletefaulty analysis informally

that if one of two simultaneous assumptions leads to a contradiction the other assumption is also disproved leads to paradoxical consequences not to be confused with the barber paradox what the tortoise said to achilles whatever logic is good enough to tell me is worth writing down also known as carrolls paradox not to be confused with the achilles and the tortoise paradox by zeno of elea catch a situation in which someone is in need of something that can only be had by not being in need of it a soldier who wants to be declared insane in order to avoid combat is deemed not insane for that very reason and will therefore not be declared insane drinker paradox in any pub there is a customer of whom it is true to say if that customer drinks everybody in the pub drinks paradox of entailment inconsistent premises always make an argument valid lottery paradox if there is one winning ticket in a large lottery it is reasonable to believe of any particular lottery ticket that it is not the winning ticket but it is not reasonable to believe that no lottery ticket will win raven paradox or hempels ravens observing a green apple increases the likelihood of all ravens being black ross paradox disjunction introduction poses a problem for imperative inference by seemingly permitting arbitrary imperatives to be inferred unexpected hanging paradox the day of the hanging will be a surprise so it cannot happen at all so it will be a surprise the surprise examination and bottle imp paradox use similar logic selfreferenceedit these paradoxes have in common a contradiction arising from either selfreference or circular reference in which several statements refer to each other in a way that following some of the references leads back to the starting point barber paradox a barber who is a man shaves all and only those men who do not shave themselves does he shave himself russells popularization of his set theoretic paradox bhartrharis paradox the thesis that there are some things which are unnameable conflicts with the notion that something is named by calling it unnameable berry paradox the phrase the first number not nameable in under ten words appears to name it in nine words crocodile dilemma if a crocodile steals a child and promises its return if the father can correctly guess exactly what the crocodile will do how should the crocodile respond in the case that the father guesses that the child will not be returned paradox of the court a law student agrees to pay his teacher after and only after winning his first case the teacher then sues the student who has not yet won a case for payment currys paradox if this sentence is true then santa claus exists epimenides paradox a cretan says all cretans are liars this paradox works in mainly the same way as the liar paradox grelling–nelson paradox is the word heterological meaning not applicable to itself a heterological word another close relative of russells paradox kleene–rosser paradox by formulating an equivalent to richards paradox untyped lambda calculus is shown to be inconsistent liar paradox this sentence is false this is the canonical selfreferential paradox also is the answer to this question no and im lying card paradox the next statement is true the previous statement is false a variant of the liar paradox that does not use selfreference pinocchio paradox what would happen if pinocchio said my nose will be growing quines paradox yields a falsehood when appended to its own quotation yields a falsehood when appended to its own quotation shows that a sentence can be paradoxical even if it is not selfreferring and does not use demonstratives or indexicals yablos paradox an ordered infinite sequence of sentences each of which says that all following sentences are false while constructed to avoid selfreference there is no consensus whether it relies on selfreference or not opposite day it is opposite day today therefore it is not opposite day but if you say it is a normal day it would be considered a normal day petronius paradox moderation in all things including moderation unsourced quotation sometimes attributed to petronius richards paradox we appear to be able to use simple english to define a decimal expansion in a way that is selfcontradictory russells paradox does the set of all those sets that do not contain themselves contain itself socratic paradox all i know is that i know nothing vaguenessedit ship of theseus it seems like you can replace any component of a ship and it is still the same ship so you can replace them all one at a time and it is still the same ship however you can then take all the original pieces and assemble them into a ship that too is the same ship you began with see also list of ship of theseus examples sorites

intersection of two higherorder curves can be greater than the number of arbitrary points needed to define one such curve elevator paradox elevators can seem to be mostly going in one direction as if they were being manufactured in the middle of the building and being disassembled on the roof and basement interesting number paradox the first number that can be considered dull rather than

more friends than they do inspection paradox why one will wait longer for a bus than one should lindleys paradox tiny errors in the null hypothesis are magnified when large data sets are analyzed leading to false but highly statistically significant results low birth weight paradox low birth weight and mothers who smoke contribute to a higher mortality rate babies of smokers have lower average birth weight but low birth weight babies born to smokers have a lower mortality rate than other low birth weight babies this is a special case of simpsons paradox simpsons paradox or the yule–simpson effect a trend that appears in different groups of data disappears when these groups are combined and the reverse trend appears for the aggregate data will rogers phenomenon the mathematical concept of an average whether defined as the mean or median leads to apparently paradoxical results—for example it is possible that moving an entry from an encyclopedia to a dictionary would increase the average entry length on both books probabilityedit the monty hall problem which door do you choose see also categoryprobability theory paradoxes bertrands box paradox a paradox of conditional probability closely related to the boy or girl paradox bertrands paradox different commonsense definitions of randomness give quite different results birthday paradox what is the chance that two people in a room have the same birthday borels paradox conditional probability density functions are not invariant under coordinate transformations boy or girl paradox a twochild family has at least one boy what is the probability that it has a girl dartboard puzzle if a dart is guaranteed to hit a dartboard and the probability of hitting a specific point is positive adding the infinitely many positive chances yields infinity but the chance of hitting the dartboard is one if the probability of hitting each point is zero the probability of hitting anywhere on the dartboard is zero false positive paradox a test that is accurate the vast majority of the time could show you have a disease but the probability that you actually have it could still be tiny grices paradox shows that the exact meaning of statements involving conditionals and probabilities is more complicated than may be obvious on casual examination monty hall problem an unintuitive consequence of conditional probability necktie paradox a wager between two people seems to favour them both very similar in essence to the twoenvelope paradox nontransitive dice you can have three dice called a b and c such that a is likely to win in a roll against b b is likely to win in a roll against c and c is likely to win in a roll against a proebstings paradox the kelly criterion is an often optimal strategy for maximizing profit in the long run proebstings paradox apparently shows that the kelly criterion can lead to ruin sleeping beauty problem a probability problem that can be correctly answered as one half or one third depending on how the question is approached three cards problem when pulling a random card how do you determine the color of the underside three prisoners problem a variation of the monty hall problem twoenvelope paradox you are given two indistinguishable envelopes each of which contains a positive sum of money one envelope contains twice as much as the other you may pick one envelope and keep whatever amount it contains you pick one envelope at random but before you open it you are given the chance to take the other envelope instead infinity and infinitesimalsedit buraliforti paradox if the ordinal numbers formed a set it would be an ordinal number that is smaller than itself cantors paradox the set of all sets would have its own power set as a subset therefore its cardinality would be at least as great as that of its power set but cantors theorem proves that power sets are strictly greater than the sets they are constructed from consequently the set of all sets would contain a subset greater than itself galileos paradox though most numbers are not squares there are no more numbers than squares see also cantors diagonal argument hilberts paradox of the grand hotel if a hotel with infinitely many rooms is full it can still take in more guests russells paradox does the set of all those sets that do not contain themselves contain itself skolems paradox countably infinite models of set theory contain uncountably infinite sets zenos paradoxes you will never reach point b from point a as you must always get halfway there and half of the half and half of that half and so on this is also a physical paradox supertasks may result in paradoxes such as benardetes paradox apparently a man can be forced to stay where he is by the mere unfulfilled intentions of the gods grandis series the sum of  can be either one zero or onehalf ross–littlewood paradox after alternately adding and removing balls to a vase infinitely often how many balls remain

size as the original banach–tarski paradox cut a ball into a finite number of pieces and reassemble the pieces to get two balls each of equal size to the first the von neumann paradox is a twodimensional analogue paradoxical set a set that can be partitioned into two sets each of which is equivalent to the original coastline paradox the perimeter of a landmass is in general illdefined coin rotation paradox a coin rotating along the edge of an identical coin will make a full revolution after traversing only half of the stationary coins circumference gabriels horn or torricellis trumpet a simple object with finite volume but infinite surface area also the mandelbrot set and various other fractals are covered by a finite area but have an infinite perimeter in fact there are no two distinct points on the boundary of the mandelbrot set that can be reached from one another by moving a finite distance along that boundary which also implies that in a sense you go no further if you walk the wrong way around the set to reach a nearby point this can be represented by a klein bottle hausdorff paradox there exists a countable subset c of the sphere s such that sc is equidecomposable with two copies of itself nikodym set a set contained in and with the same lebesgue measure as the unit square yet for every one of its points there is a straight line intersecting the nikodym set only in that point sphere eversion a sphere can topologically be turned inside out decision theoryedit abilene paradox people can make decisions based not on what they actually want to do but on what they think that other people want to do with the result that everybody decides to do something that nobody really wants to do but only what they thought that everybody else wanted to do

belief that people generally disapprove of the united states congress as a whole but support the congressman from their own congressional district fredkins paradox the more similar two choices are the more time a decisionmaking agent spends on deciding green paradox policies intending to reduce future co emissions may lead to increased emissions in the present hedgehogs dilemma or lovers paradox despite goodwill human intimacy cannot occur without substantial mutual harm inventors paradox it is easier to solve a more general problem that covers the specifics of the soughtafter solution kavkas

navigational precision may result in increased collision risk newcombs paradox how do you play a game against an omniscient opponent paradox of tolerance should one tolerate intolerance if intolerance would destroy the possibility of tolerance paradox of voting also known as the downs paradox for a rational selfinterested voter the costs of voting will normally exceed the expected benefits so why do people keep voting parrondos paradox it is possible to play two losing games alternately to eventually win prevention paradox for one person to benefit many people have to change their behavior — even though they receive no benefit or even suffer from the change prisoners dilemma two people might not cooperate even if it is in both their best interests to do so voting paradox also known as

existence of liquid water early in the earths history and the expectation that the output of the young sun would have been insufficient to melt ice on earth gzk paradox extremeenergy cosmic rays have been observed that seem to violate the greisen–zatsepin–kuzmin limit which is a consequence of special relativity paradox of youth compared to theory there is an overabundance of young stars close to the supermassive black hole in the galactic center classical mechanicsedit achilles and the tortoise if the tortoise is ahead of achilles by the time achilles reaches the tortoises current position the tortoise will have moved a bit further ahead which goes on indefinitely archers paradox an archer must in order to hit his target not aim directly at it but slightly to the side not to be confused with the arrow paradox arrow paradox if we divide time into discrete duration slices no motion is happening in each of them so taking them all as a whole motion is impossible hydrostatic paradox a massive battleship can float in a few litres of water aristotles wheel paradox rolling joined concentric wheels seem to trace the same distance with their circumferences even though the circumferences are different carrolls paradox the angular momentum of a stick should be zero but is not dalemberts paradox flow of an inviscid fluid produces no net force on a solid body knudsen paradox based on the navier–stokes equations one would expect the mass flux in a channel to decrease with increasing knudsen number but there is a distinct minimum around knudsen number  dennys paradox surfacedwelling arthropods such as the water strider should not be able to propel themselves horizontally dichotomy paradox to reach its target an airborne arrow must first reach an infinite number of midpoints between its current position and the target elevator paradox even though hydrometers are used to measure fluid density a hydrometer will not indicate changes of fluid density caused by changing atmospheric pressure feynman sprinkler which way does a sprinkler rotate when submerged in a tank and made to suck in the surrounding fluid painlevé paradox rigidbody dynamics with contact and friction is inconsistent tea leaf paradox when a cup of tea is stirred the leaves assemble in the center even though centrifugal force pushes them outward upstream contamination when a fluid is poured from a higher container onto a lower one particles can climb up the falling water cosmologyedit bentleys paradox in a newtonian universe gravitation should pull all matter into a single point boltzmann brain if the universe we observe resulted from a random thermodynamic fluctuation it would be vastly more likely to be a simple one than the complex one we observe the simplest case would be just a brain floating in vacuum having the thoughts and sensations you have fermi paradox if there are as various arguments suggest many other sentient species in the universe then where are they shouldnt their presence be obvious heat death paradox if the universe was infinitely old it would be in thermodynamical equilibrium which contradicts what we observe olbers paradox why is the night sky dark if there is an infinity of stars covering every part of the celestial sphere electromagnetismedit faraday paradox an apparent violation of faradays law of electromagnetic induction quantum mechanicsedit aharonov–bohm effect a charged particle is affected by an electromagnetic field even though it has no local contact with that field bells theorem why do measured quantum particles not

influence each other in quantum mechanics extinction paradox in the small wavelength limit the total scattering cross section of an impenetrable sphere is twice its geometrical crosssectional area which is the value obtained in classical mechanics hardys paradox how can we make inferences about past events that we havent observed while at the same time acknowledge that the act of observing it affects the reality we are inferring to klein paradox when the potential of a potential barrier becomes similar to the mass of the impinging particle it becomes transparent mott problem spherically

ideal gas is entropy an extensive variable loschmidts paradox why is there an inevitable increase in entropy when the laws of physics are invariant under time reversal the time reversal symmetry of physical laws appears to contradict the second law of thermodynamics maxwells demon the second law of thermodynamics seems to be violated by a cleverly operated trapdoor mpemba effect hot water can under certain conditions freeze faster than cold water even though it must pass the lower temperature on the way to freezing duncans paradox gassurface reactions create either steadystate temperature or pressure differentials that can be used in perpetual motion machines schmidts paradox in russian – the contradiction discovered in  between the observed vertical turbulent heat flux in the surface layer and the theory of heat conduction in the atmosphere  biologyedit antarctic paradox in some areas of the oceans phytoplankton concentrations are low despite there apparently being sufficient nutrients cvalue enigma genome size does not correlate with organismal complexity for example some unicellular organisms have genomes much larger than that of humans coles paradox even a tiny fecundity advantage of one additional offspring would favor the evolution of semelparity grays paradox despite their relatively small muscle mass dolphins can swim at high speeds and obtain large accelerations hormesis exposure to small doses of toxins can have beneficial effects lek paradox persistent female choice for particular male trait values should erode genetic variance in male traits

higher birth weights than can be expected from their socioeconomic status obesity survival paradox although the negative health consequences of obesity in the general population are well supported by the available evidence health outcomes in certain subgroups seem to be improved at an increased bmi petos paradox humans and other smalltomediumsized mammals get cancer with high frequency while larger mammals like whales do not if cancer is essentially a negative outcome lottery at the cell level and larger organisms have more cells and thus more potentially cancerous cell divisions one

medical conditions in which there is reduced cardiac output such as cardiac tamponade or constrictive pericarditis also known as the pulse paradox second wind the second wind is a sudden period of increased wakefulness in individuals deprived of sleep that tends to coincide with the individuals circadian rhythm although the individual is more wakeful and aware of their surroundings they are continuing to accrue sleep debt and thus are actually exacerbating their sleep deprivation chemistryedit faraday paradox electrochemistry diluted nitric acid will corrode steel while concentrated nitric acid will not levinthal paradox the length of time that it takes for a protein chain to find its folded state is many orders of magnitude shorter than it would be if it freely searched all

paradox also ontological paradox can a time traveler send himself information with no outside source polchinskis paradox a billiard ball can be thrown into a wormhole in such a way that it would emerge in the past and knock its incoming past self away from the wormhole entrance creating a variant of the grandfather paradox predestination paradox a man travels back in time to discover the cause of a famous fire while in the building where the fire started he accidentally knocks over a kerosene lantern and causes a fire the same fire that would inspire him years later to travel back in time the bootstrap paradox is closely tied to this in which as a result of time travel information or objects appear to have no beginning temporal paradox what happens when a time traveler does things in the past that prevent him from doing them in the first place grandfather paradox you travel back in time and kill your grandfather before he conceives one of your parents which precludes your own conception and therefore you couldnt go back in time and kill your grandfather hitlers murder paradox you travel back in time and kill a famous person in history before they become famous but if the

correct at the same time believing that at least one of them is incorrect problem of evil epicurean paradox the existence of evil seems to be incompatible with the existence of an omnipotent omniscient and morally perfect god rulefollowing paradox even though rules are intended to determine actions no course of action could be determined by a rule because any course of action can be made out to accord with the rule when a white horse is not a horse white horses are not horses because white and horse refer to different things zenos paradoxes you will never reach point b from point a as

contradiction with the heckscher–ohlin theorem lucas paradox capital is not flowing from developed countries to developing countries despite the fact that developing countries have lower levels of capital per worker and therefore higher returns to capital mandevilles paradox actions that may be vicious to individuals may benefit society as a whole mayfields paradox keeping everyone out of an information system is impossible but so is getting everybody in metzler paradox the imposition of a tariff on imports may reduce the relative internal price of that good paradox of prosperity why do generations that significantly improve the economic climate seem to generally rear a successor generation that consumes rather than produces paradox of thrift if everyone saves more money during times of recession then aggregate demand will fall and will in turn lower total savings in the population paradox of toil if everyone tries to work during times of recession lower wages will reduce prices leading to more deflationary expectations leading to further thrift reducing demand and thereby reducing employment paradox of value also known as diamondwater paradox water is more useful than diamonds yet is a lot cheaper productivity paradox also known as solow computer paradox worker productivity may go down despite technological improvements scitovsky paradox using the kaldor–hicks

sartre miscellaneousedit absence paradox no one is ever here boninis paradox models or simulations that explain the workings of complex systems are seemingly impossible to construct as a model of a

assumptions leads to a contradiction the other assumption is also disproved leads to paradoxical consequences not to be confused with the barber paradox what the tortoise said to achilles whatever logic is good enough to tell me is worth writing down also known as carrolls paradox not to be confused with the achilles and the tortoise paradox by zeno of elea catch a situation in which someone is in need of something that can only be had by not being in need of it a soldier who wants to be declared insane in order to avoid combat is deemed not insane for that very reason and will therefore not be declared insane drinker paradox in any pub there is a customer of whom it is true to say if that customer drinks everybody in the pub drinks paradox of entailment inconsistent premises always make an argument valid lottery paradox if there is one winning ticket in a large lottery it is reasonable to believe of any particular lottery ticket that it is not the winning ticket but it is not reasonable to believe that no lottery ticket will win raven paradox or hempels ravens observing a green apple increases the likelihood of all ravens being black ross paradox disjunction introduction poses a problem for imperative inference by seemingly permitting arbitrary imperatives to be inferred unexpected hanging paradox the day of the hanging will be a surprise so it cannot happen at all so it will be a surprise the surprise examination and bottle imp paradox use similar logic selfreferenceedit these paradoxes have in common a contradiction arising from either selfreference or circular reference in which several statements refer to each other in a way that following some of the references leads back to the starting point barber paradox a barber who is a man shaves all and only those men who do not shave themselves does he shave himself russells popularization of his set theoretic paradox bhartrharis paradox the thesis that there are some things which are unnameable conflicts with the notion that something is named by calling it unnameable berry paradox the phrase the first number not nameable in under ten words appears to name it in nine words crocodile dilemma if a crocodile steals a child and promises its return if the father can correctly guess exactly what the crocodile will do how should the crocodile respond in the case that the father guesses that the child will not be returned paradox of the court a law student agrees to pay his teacher after and only after winning his first case the teacher then sues the student who has not yet won a case for payment currys paradox if this sentence is true then santa claus exists epimenides paradox a cretan says all cretans are liars this paradox works in mainly the same way as the liar paradox grelling–nelson paradox is the word heterological meaning not applicable to itself a heterological word another close relative of russells paradox kleene–rosser paradox by formulating an equivalent to richards paradox untyped lambda calculus is shown to be inconsistent liar paradox this sentence is false this is the canonical selfreferential paradox also is the answer to this question no and im lying card paradox the next statement is true the previous statement is false a variant of the liar paradox that does not use selfreference pinocchio paradox what would happen if pinocchio said my nose will be growing quines paradox yields a falsehood when appended to its own quotation yields a falsehood when appended to its own quotation shows that a sentence can be paradoxical even if it is not selfreferring and does not use demonstratives or indexicals yablos paradox an ordered infinite sequence of sentences each of which says that all following sentences are false while constructed to avoid selfreference there is no consensus whether it relies on selfreference or not opposite day it is opposite day today therefore it is not opposite day but if you say it is a normal day it would be considered a normal day petronius paradox moderation in all things including moderation unsourced quotation sometimes attributed to petronius richards paradox we appear to be able to use simple english to define a decimal expansion in a way that is selfcontradictory russells paradox does the set of all those sets that do not contain themselves contain itself socratic paradox all i know is that i know nothing vaguenessedit ship of theseus it seems like you can replace any component of a ship and it is still the same ship so you can replace them all one at a time and it is still the same ship however you can then take all the original pieces and assemble them into a ship that too is the same ship you began with see also list of ship of theseus examples sorites paradox also known as the paradox of the

greater than the number of arbitrary points needed to define one such curve elevator paradox elevators can seem to be mostly going in one direction as if they were being manufactured in the middle of the building and being disassembled on the roof and basement interesting number paradox the first number that can be considered dull rather than interesting becomes interesting because of that fact

why one will wait longer for a bus than one should lindleys paradox tiny errors in the null hypothesis are magnified when large data sets are analyzed leading to false but highly statistically significant results low birth weight paradox low birth weight and mothers who smoke contribute to a higher mortality rate babies of smokers have lower average birth weight but low birth weight babies born to smokers have a lower mortality rate than other low birth weight babies this is a special case of simpsons paradox simpsons paradox or the yule–simpson effect a trend that appears in different groups of data disappears when these groups are combined and the reverse trend appears for the aggregate data will rogers phenomenon the mathematical concept of an average whether defined as the mean or median leads to apparently paradoxical results—for example it is possible that moving an entry from an encyclopedia to a dictionary would increase the average entry length on both books probabilityedit the monty hall problem which door do you choose see also categoryprobability theory paradoxes bertrands box paradox a paradox of conditional probability closely related to the boy or girl paradox bertrands paradox different commonsense definitions of randomness give quite different results birthday paradox what is the chance that two people in a room have the same birthday borels

girl dartboard puzzle if a dart is guaranteed to hit a dartboard and the probability of hitting a specific point is positive adding the infinitely many positive chances yields infinity but the chance of hitting the dartboard is one if the probability of hitting each point is zero the probability of hitting anywhere on the dartboard is zero false positive paradox a test that is accurate the vast majority of the time could show you have a disease but the probability that you actually have it could still be tiny grices paradox shows that the exact meaning of statements involving conditionals and probabilities is more complicated than may be obvious on casual examination monty hall problem an unintuitive consequence of conditional probability necktie paradox a wager between two people seems to favour them both very similar in essence to the twoenvelope paradox nontransitive dice you can have three dice called a b and c such that a is likely to win in a roll against b b is likely to win in a roll against c and c is likely to win in a roll against a proebstings paradox the kelly criterion is an often optimal strategy for maximizing profit in the long run proebstings paradox apparently shows that the kelly criterion can lead to ruin sleeping beauty problem a probability problem that can be correctly answered as one half or one third depending on how the question is approached three cards problem when pulling a random card how do you determine the color of the underside three prisoners problem a variation of the monty hall problem twoenvelope paradox you are given two indistinguishable envelopes each of which contains a positive sum of money one envelope contains twice as much as the other you may pick one envelope and keep whatever amount it contains you pick one envelope at random but before you open it you are given the chance to take the other envelope instead infinity and infinitesimalsedit buraliforti paradox if the ordinal numbers formed a set it would be an ordinal number that is smaller than itself cantors paradox the set of all sets would have its own power set as a subset therefore its cardinality would be at least as great as that of its power set but cantors theorem proves that power sets are strictly greater than the sets they are constructed from consequently the set of all sets would contain a subset greater than itself galileos paradox though most numbers are not squares there are no more numbers than squares see also cantors diagonal argument hilberts paradox of the grand hotel if a hotel with infinitely many rooms is full it can still take in more guests russells paradox does the set of all those sets that do not contain themselves contain itself skolems paradox countably infinite models of set theory contain uncountably infinite sets zenos paradoxes you will never reach point b from point a as you must always get halfway there and half of the half and half of that half and so on this is also a physical

ball into a finite number of pieces and reassemble the pieces to get two balls each of equal size to the first the von neumann paradox is a twodimensional analogue paradoxical set a set that can be partitioned into two sets each of which is equivalent to the original coastline paradox the perimeter of a landmass is in general illdefined coin rotation paradox a coin rotating along the edge of an identical coin will make a full revolution after traversing only half of the stationary coins circumference gabriels horn or torricellis trumpet a simple object with finite volume but infinite surface area also the mandelbrot set and various other fractals are covered by a finite area but have an infinite perimeter in fact there are no two distinct points on the boundary of the mandelbrot set that can be reached from one another by moving a finite distance along that boundary which also implies that in a sense you go no further if you walk the wrong way around the set to reach a nearby point this can be represented by a klein bottle hausdorff paradox there exists a countable subset c of the sphere s such that sc is equidecomposable with two copies of itself nikodym set a set contained in and with the same lebesgue measure as the unit square yet for every one of its points there is a straight line intersecting the nikodym set only in that point sphere eversion a sphere can topologically be turned inside out decision theoryedit abilene paradox people can make decisions based not on what they actually want to do but on what they think that other people want to do with the result that everybody decides to do something that nobody really wants to do but only what they thought that everybody else wanted to do apportionment paradox some systems of apportioning

united states congress as a whole but support the congressman from their own congressional district fredkins paradox the more similar two choices are the more time a decisionmaking agent spends on deciding green paradox policies intending to reduce future co emissions may lead to increased emissions in the present hedgehogs dilemma or lovers paradox despite goodwill human intimacy cannot occur without substantial mutual harm inventors paradox it is easier to solve a more general problem that covers the specifics of the soughtafter solution kavkas toxin puzzle can one intend to drink the nondeadly toxin if the intention is the only thing needed to get the reward mortons fork choosing between unpalatable alternatives navigation paradox increased navigational precision may result in increased collision risk newcombs paradox how do you play a game against an omniscient opponent paradox of tolerance should one tolerate intolerance if intolerance would destroy the possibility of tolerance paradox of voting also known as the downs paradox for a rational selfinterested voter the costs of voting will normally exceed the expected benefits so why do people keep voting parrondos

earths history and the expectation that the output of the young sun would have been insufficient to melt ice on earth gzk paradox extremeenergy cosmic rays have been observed that seem to violate the greisen–zatsepin–kuzmin limit which is a consequence of special relativity paradox of youth compared to theory there is an overabundance of young stars close to the supermassive black hole in the galactic center classical mechanicsedit achilles and the tortoise if the tortoise is ahead of achilles by the time achilles reaches the tortoises current position the tortoise will have moved a bit further ahead which goes on indefinitely archers paradox an archer must in order to hit his target not aim directly at it but slightly to the side not to be confused with the arrow paradox arrow paradox if we divide time into discrete duration slices no motion is happening in each of them so taking them all as a whole motion is impossible hydrostatic paradox a massive battleship can float in a few litres of water aristotles wheel paradox rolling joined concentric wheels seem to trace the same distance with their circumferences even though the circumferences are different carrolls paradox the angular momentum of a stick should be zero but is not dalemberts paradox flow of an inviscid fluid produces no net force on a solid body knudsen paradox based on the navier–stokes equations one would expect the mass flux in a channel to decrease with increasing knudsen number but there is a distinct minimum around knudsen number  dennys paradox surfacedwelling arthropods such as the water strider should not be able to propel themselves horizontally dichotomy paradox to reach its target an airborne arrow must first reach an infinite number of midpoints between its current position and the target elevator paradox even though hydrometers are used to measure fluid density a hydrometer will not indicate changes of fluid density caused by changing atmospheric pressure feynman sprinkler which way does a sprinkler rotate when submerged in a tank and made to suck in the surrounding fluid painlevé paradox rigidbody dynamics with contact and friction is inconsistent tea leaf paradox when a cup of tea is stirred the leaves assemble in the center even though centrifugal force pushes them outward upstream contamination when a fluid is poured from a higher container onto a lower one particles can climb up the falling water cosmologyedit bentleys paradox in a newtonian universe gravitation should pull all matter into a single point boltzmann brain if the universe we observe resulted from a random thermodynamic fluctuation it would be vastly more likely to be a simple one than the complex one we observe the simplest case would be just a brain floating in vacuum having the thoughts and sensations you have fermi paradox if there are as various arguments suggest many other sentient species in the universe then where are they shouldnt their presence be obvious heat death paradox if the universe was infinitely old it would be in thermodynamical equilibrium which contradicts what we observe olbers paradox why is the night sky dark if there is an infinity of stars covering every part of the celestial sphere electromagnetismedit faraday paradox an apparent violation of faradays law of electromagnetic induction quantum mechanicsedit aharonov–bohm effect a charged

doubleslit experiment matter and energy can act as a wave or as a particle depending on the experiment einstein–podolsky–rosen paradox can far away events influence each other in quantum mechanics extinction paradox in the small wavelength limit the total scattering cross section of an impenetrable sphere is twice its geometrical crosssectional area which is the value obtained in classical mechanics hardys paradox how can we make inferences about past events that we havent observed while at the same time acknowledge that the act of observing it affects the reality we are inferring to klein paradox when the potential of a potential barrier becomes similar to the mass of the impinging particle it becomes transparent mott problem spherically symmetric wave functions when observed

relativity predicts that a person making a round trip will return younger than his or her identical twin who stayed at home thermodynamicsedit gibbs paradox in an ideal gas is entropy an extensive variable loschmidts paradox why is there an inevitable increase in entropy when the laws of physics are invariant under time reversal the time reversal symmetry of physical laws appears to contradict the second law of thermodynamics maxwells demon the second law of thermodynamics seems to be violated by a cleverly operated trapdoor mpemba effect hot water can under certain conditions freeze faster than cold water even though it must pass the lower temperature on the way to freezing duncans paradox gassurface reactions create either steadystate temperature or pressure differentials that can be

anomalous pattern of inheritance in the fragile x syndrome temporal paradox paleontology when did the ancestors of birds live health and nutritionedit french paradox the observation that the french suffer a relatively low incidence of coronary heart disease despite having a diet relatively rich in saturated fats which are assumed to be the leading dietary cause of such disease glucose paradox

significantly greater than in the premeditation control state and also in three nonmeditation control groups mexican paradox mexican children tend to have higher birth weights than can be expected from their socioeconomic status obesity survival paradox although the negative health consequences of obesity in the general population are well supported by the available evidence health outcomes in certain subgroups seem to be improved at an increased bmi petos paradox humans and other smalltomediumsized mammals get cancer with high frequency while larger mammals like whales do not if cancer is essentially a negative outcome lottery at the cell level and larger organisms have more cells and thus more potentially cancerous cell divisions one would expect larger organisms to be more

cardiac output such as cardiac tamponade or constrictive pericarditis also known as the pulse paradox second wind the second wind is a sudden period of increased wakefulness in individuals deprived of sleep that tends to coincide with the individuals circadian rhythm although the individual is more wakeful and aware of their surroundings they are continuing to accrue sleep debt and thus are actually exacerbating their sleep deprivation chemistryedit faraday paradox electrochemistry diluted nitric acid will corrode steel while concentrated nitric acid will not levinthal paradox the length

himself information with no outside source polchinskis paradox a billiard ball can be thrown into a wormhole in such a way that it would emerge in the past and knock its incoming past self away from the wormhole entrance creating a variant of the grandfather paradox predestination paradox a man travels back in time to discover the cause of a famous fire while in the building where the fire started he accidentally knocks over a kerosene lantern and causes a fire the same fire that would inspire him years later to travel back in time the bootstrap paradox is closely tied to this in which as a result of time travel information or objects appear to have no beginning temporal paradox what happens when a time traveler does things in the past that prevent him from doing them in the first place grandfather paradox you travel back in time and kill your grandfather before he conceives one of your parents which precludes your own conception and therefore you couldnt go back in time and kill your grandfather hitlers murder paradox you travel back in time and kill a famous person in history before they become famous but if the person had never been famous then he could not have been targeted as a famous person linguistics and artificial intelligenceedit bracketing paradox is a historical linguist a linguist who is historical or someone who studies historical linguistics

a rock too heavy for itself to lift preface paradox the author of a book may be justified in believing that all his statements in the book are correct at the same time believing that at least one of them is incorrect problem of evil epicurean paradox the existence of evil seems to be incompatible with the existence of an omnipotent omniscient and morally perfect god rulefollowing paradox even though rules are intended to determine actions no course of action could be determined by a rule because any course of action can be made out to accord with the rule when a white horse is not a horse white horses are not horses because white and horse refer to different things zenos paradoxes you will never reach point b from point a as you must always get halfway there and half of the half and half of that half and so on  this is also a paradox of the infinite mysticismedit mayaillusion our illusions are not real yet its real that illusion itself exists tzimtzum in kabbalah how to reconcile

adding extra capacity to a network can reduce overall performance deaton paradox consumption varies surprisingly smoothly despite sharp variations in income demographiceconomic paradox nations or subpopulations with higher gdp per capita are observed to have fewer children even though a richer population can support more children downs–thomson paradox increasing road capacity at the expense of investments in public transport can make overall congestion on the road worse easterlin paradox for countries with income sufficient to meet basic needs the reported level of happiness does not correlate with national income per person edgeworth paradox with capacity constraints there may not be an equilibrium ellsberg paradox people exhibit ambiguity aversion as distinct from risk aversion in contradiction with expected utility theory european paradox the perceived failure of european countries to translate scientific advances into marketable innovations gibsons paradox why were

from developed countries to developing countries despite the fact that developing countries have lower levels of capital per worker and therefore higher returns to capital mandevilles paradox actions that may be vicious to individuals may benefit society as a whole mayfields paradox keeping everyone out of an information system is impossible but so is getting everybody in metzler paradox the imposition of a tariff on imports may reduce the relative internal price of that good paradox of prosperity why do generations that significantly improve the economic climate seem to generally rear a successor generation that consumes rather than produces paradox of thrift if everyone saves more money during times of recession then aggregate demand will fall and will in turn lower total savings in the population paradox of toil if everyone tries to work during times of recession lower wages will reduce prices leading to more deflationary expectations leading to further thrift reducing demand and thereby reducing employment paradox of value also known as diamondwater paradox water is more useful than diamonds yet is a lot cheaper productivity paradox also known as solow computer paradox

antagonisms results in the dissolution of jewish identity a theory that resonates in works of dershowitz and sartre miscellaneousedit absence paradox no one is ever here boninis paradox models or simulations that explain the workings of complex systems are seemingly impossible to construct as a model of a complex system becomes more complete it becomes less understandable for it to be more

barbershop paradox the supposition that if one of two simultaneous assumptions leads to a contradiction the other assumption is also disproved leads to paradoxical consequences not to be confused with the barber paradox what the tortoise said to achilles whatever logic is good enough to tell me is worth writing down also known as carrolls paradox not to be confused with the achilles and the tortoise paradox by zeno of elea catch a situation in which someone is in need of something that can only be had by not being in need of it a soldier who wants to be declared insane in order to avoid combat is deemed not insane for that very reason and will therefore not be declared insane drinker paradox in any pub there is a customer of whom it is true to say if that customer drinks everybody in

the hanging will be a surprise so it cannot happen at all so it will be a surprise the surprise examination and bottle imp paradox use similar logic selfreferenceedit these paradoxes have in common a contradiction arising from either selfreference or circular reference in which several statements refer to each other in a way that following some of the references leads back to the starting point barber paradox a barber who is a man shaves all and only those men who do not shave themselves does he shave himself russells popularization of his set theoretic paradox bhartrharis paradox the thesis that there are some things which are unnameable conflicts with the notion that something is named by calling it unnameable berry paradox the phrase the first number not nameable in under ten words appears to name it in nine words crocodile dilemma if a crocodile steals a child and promises its return if the father can correctly guess exactly what the crocodile will do how should the crocodile respond in the case that the father guesses that the child will not be returned paradox of the court a law student agrees to pay his teacher after and only after winning his first case the teacher then sues the student who has not yet won a case for payment currys paradox if this sentence is true then santa claus exists epimenides paradox a cretan says all cretans are liars this paradox works in mainly the same way as the liar paradox grelling–nelson paradox is the word heterological meaning not applicable to itself a heterological word another close relative of russells paradox kleene–rosser paradox by formulating an equivalent to richards paradox untyped lambda calculus is shown to be inconsistent liar paradox this sentence is false this is the canonical selfreferential paradox also is the answer to this question no and im lying card paradox the next statement is true the previous statement is false a variant of the liar paradox that does not use selfreference pinocchio paradox what would happen if pinocchio said my nose will be growing quines paradox yields a falsehood when appended to its own quotation yields a falsehood when appended to its own quotation shows that a sentence can be paradoxical even if it is not selfreferring and does not use demonstratives or indexicals yablos paradox an ordered infinite sequence of sentences each of which says that all following sentences are false while constructed to avoid selfreference there is no consensus whether it relies on selfreference or not opposite day it is opposite day today therefore it is not opposite day but if you say it is a normal day it would be considered a normal day petronius paradox moderation in all things including moderation unsourced quotation sometimes attributed to petronius richards paradox we appear to be able to use simple english to define a decimal expansion in a way that is selfcontradictory russells paradox does the set of all those sets that do not contain themselves contain itself socratic paradox all i know is that i know nothing vaguenessedit ship of theseus it seems like you can replace any component of a ship and it is still the same ship so you

of ship of theseus examples sorites paradox also known as the paradox of the heap if you remove a single grain of sand from a heap you still have a heap keep removing single grains and the heap will

paradox the number of points of intersection of two higherorder curves can be greater than the number of arbitrary points needed to define one such curve elevator paradox elevators can seem to be mostly going in one direction as if they were being manufactured in the middle of the building and being disassembled on the roof and basement interesting number paradox the first number that can be

almost everyone their friends have more friends than they do inspection paradox why one will wait longer for a bus than one should lindleys paradox tiny errors in the null hypothesis are magnified when large data sets are analyzed leading to false but highly statistically significant results low birth weight paradox low birth weight and mothers who smoke contribute to a higher mortality rate babies of smokers have lower average birth weight but low birth weight babies born to smokers have a lower mortality rate than other low birth weight babies this is a special case of simpsons paradox simpsons paradox or the yule–simpson effect a trend that appears in different groups of data disappears when these groups are combined and the reverse trend appears for the aggregate data will rogers phenomenon the mathematical concept of an average whether defined as the mean or median leads to apparently paradoxical results—for example it is possible that moving an entry from an encyclopedia to a dictionary would increase the average entry length on both books probabilityedit the monty hall problem which door do you choose see also categoryprobability theory paradoxes bertrands box paradox a paradox of conditional probability closely related to the boy or girl paradox bertrands paradox different commonsense definitions of randomness give quite different results birthday paradox what is

family has at least one boy what is the probability that it has a girl dartboard puzzle if a dart is guaranteed to hit a dartboard and the probability of hitting a specific point is positive adding the infinitely many positive chances yields infinity but the chance of hitting the dartboard is one if the probability of hitting each point is zero the probability of hitting anywhere on the dartboard is zero false positive paradox a test that is accurate the vast majority of the time could show you have a disease but the probability that you actually have it could still be tiny grices paradox shows that the exact meaning of statements involving conditionals and probabilities is more complicated than may be obvious on casual examination monty hall problem an unintuitive consequence of conditional probability necktie paradox a wager between two people seems to favour them both very similar in essence to the twoenvelope paradox nontransitive dice you can have three dice called a b and c such that a is likely to win in a roll against b b is likely to win in a roll against c and c is likely to win in a roll against a proebstings paradox the kelly criterion is an often optimal strategy for maximizing profit in the long run proebstings paradox apparently shows that the kelly criterion can lead to ruin sleeping beauty problem a probability problem that can be correctly answered as one half or one third depending on how the question is approached three cards problem when pulling a random card how do you determine the color of the underside three prisoners problem a variation of the monty hall problem twoenvelope paradox you are given two indistinguishable envelopes each of which contains a positive sum of money one envelope contains twice as much as the other you may pick one envelope and keep whatever amount it contains you pick one envelope at random but before you open it you are given the chance to take the other envelope instead infinity and infinitesimalsedit buraliforti paradox if the ordinal numbers formed a set it would be an ordinal number that is smaller than itself cantors paradox the set of all sets would have its own power set as a subset therefore its cardinality would be at least as great as that of its power set but cantors theorem proves that power sets are strictly greater than the sets they are constructed from consequently the set of all sets would contain a subset greater than itself galileos paradox though most numbers are not squares there are no more numbers than squares see also cantors diagonal argument hilberts paradox of the grand hotel if a hotel with infinitely many rooms is full it can still take in more guests russells paradox does the set of all those sets that do not contain themselves contain itself skolems paradox countably infinite models of set theory contain uncountably infinite sets zenos paradoxes you will never reach point b from point a as you must always get

where he is by the mere unfulfilled intentions of the gods grandis series the sum of  can be either one zero or onehalf ross–littlewood paradox after alternately adding and removing balls to a vase infinitely often how many balls remain thomsons lamp after flicking a lamp on and off infinitely often is it on or off geometry and topologyedit the banach–tarski paradox a ball can be decomposed and reassembled into two balls the same size as the original banach–tarski paradox cut a ball into a finite number of pieces and reassemble the pieces to get two balls each of equal size to the first the von neumann paradox is a twodimensional analogue paradoxical set a set that can be partitioned into two sets each of which is equivalent to the original coastline paradox the perimeter of a landmass is in general illdefined coin rotation paradox a coin rotating along the edge of an identical coin will make a full revolution after traversing only half of the stationary coins circumference gabriels horn or torricellis trumpet a simple object with finite volume but infinite surface area also the mandelbrot set and various other fractals are covered by a finite area but have an infinite perimeter in fact there are no two distinct points on the boundary of the mandelbrot set that can be reached from one another by moving a finite distance along that boundary which also implies that in a sense you go no further if you walk the wrong way around the set to reach a nearby point this can be represented by a klein bottle hausdorff paradox there exists a countable subset c of the sphere s such that sc is equidecomposable with two copies of itself nikodym set a set contained in and with the same lebesgue measure as the unit square yet for every one of its points there is a straight line intersecting the nikodym set only in that point sphere eversion a sphere can topologically be turned inside out decision theoryedit abilene paradox people can make decisions based not on what they actually want to do but on what they think that other people want to do with the result that everybody decides to do something that nobody really wants to do but only what they thought that everybody else wanted to do apportionment paradox some systems of apportioning representation can have unintuitive results due to rounding alabama paradox increasing the total number of seats might shrink one

fennos paradox the belief that people generally disapprove of the united states congress as a whole but support the congressman from their own congressional district fredkins paradox the more similar two choices are the more time a decisionmaking agent spends on deciding green paradox policies intending to reduce future co emissions may lead to increased emissions in the present hedgehogs dilemma or lovers paradox despite goodwill human intimacy cannot occur without substantial mutual harm inventors paradox it is easier to solve a more general problem that covers the specifics of the soughtafter solution kavkas toxin puzzle can one intend to drink the nondeadly toxin if the intention is the only thing needed to get the reward mortons fork choosing between unpalatable alternatives navigation paradox increased navigational precision may result in increased collision risk newcombs paradox how do you play a game against an omniscient opponent paradox of tolerance should one tolerate intolerance if intolerance would destroy the possibility of tolerance paradox of voting also known as the downs paradox for a rational selfinterested voter the costs of voting will normally exceed the expected benefits so why do people keep voting parrondos paradox it is possible to play two losing games alternately to eventually win prevention paradox for one person to benefit many people have to change their behavior — even though they receive no benefit or even suffer from the change prisoners dilemma two people might not cooperate even if it is in both their best interests to do so voting paradox also known as condorcets paradox and paradox of voting a group of separately rational individuals may have preferences that are irrational in the aggregate willpower paradox those

the contradiction between existence of liquid water early in the earths history and the expectation that the output of the young sun would have been insufficient to melt ice on earth gzk paradox extremeenergy cosmic rays have been observed that seem to violate the greisen–zatsepin–kuzmin limit which is a consequence of special relativity paradox of youth compared to theory there is an overabundance of young stars close to the supermassive black hole in the galactic center classical mechanicsedit achilles and the tortoise if the tortoise is ahead of achilles by the time achilles reaches the tortoises current position the tortoise will have moved a bit further ahead which goes on indefinitely archers paradox an archer must in order to hit his target not aim directly at it but slightly to the side not to be confused with the arrow paradox arrow paradox if we divide time into discrete duration slices no motion is happening in each of them so taking them all as a whole motion is impossible hydrostatic paradox a massive battleship can float in a few litres of water aristotles wheel paradox rolling joined concentric wheels seem to trace the same distance with their circumferences even though the circumferences are different carrolls paradox the angular momentum of a stick should be zero but is not dalemberts paradox flow of an inviscid fluid produces no net force on a solid body knudsen paradox based on the navier–stokes equations one would expect the mass flux in a channel to decrease with increasing knudsen number but there is a distinct minimum around knudsen number  dennys paradox surfacedwelling arthropods such as the water strider should not be able to propel themselves horizontally dichotomy paradox to reach its target an airborne arrow must first reach an infinite number of midpoints between its current position and the target elevator paradox even though hydrometers are used to measure fluid density a hydrometer will not indicate changes of fluid density caused by changing atmospheric pressure feynman sprinkler which way does a sprinkler rotate when submerged in a tank and made to suck in the surrounding fluid painlevé paradox rigidbody dynamics with contact and friction is inconsistent tea leaf paradox when a cup of tea is stirred the leaves assemble in the center even though centrifugal force pushes them outward upstream contamination when a fluid is poured from a higher container onto a lower one particles can climb up the falling water cosmologyedit bentleys paradox in a newtonian universe gravitation should pull all matter into a single point boltzmann brain if the universe we observe resulted from a random thermodynamic fluctuation it would be vastly more likely to be a simple one than the complex one we observe the simplest case would be just a brain floating in vacuum having the thoughts and sensations you have fermi paradox if there are as various arguments suggest many other sentient species in the universe then where are they shouldnt their presence be obvious heat death paradox if the universe was infinitely old it would be in thermodynamical equilibrium which contradicts what we observe olbers paradox why is the night sky dark if there is an infinity of stars covering every part of the celestial sphere electromagnetismedit faraday paradox an apparent violation of faradays law of electromagnetic induction quantum mechanicsedit aharonov–bohm effect a charged particle is affected by an electromagnetic field even though it has no local contact with that field bells theorem why do measured quantum particles not satisfy mathematical probability theory doubleslit experiment matter and energy can act as a wave or as a particle depending on the experiment einstein–podolsky–rosen paradox can far away events influence each other in quantum mechanics extinction paradox in the small wavelength limit the total scattering cross section of an impenetrable sphere is twice its geometrical crosssectional area which is the value obtained in classical mechanics hardys paradox how can we make inferences about past events that we havent observed while at the same time acknowledge that the act of observing it affects the reality we are inferring to klein paradox when the potential of a potential barrier becomes similar to the mass of the impinging particle it

home thermodynamicsedit gibbs paradox in an ideal gas is entropy an extensive variable loschmidts paradox why is there an inevitable increase in entropy when the laws of physics are invariant under time reversal the time reversal symmetry of physical laws appears to contradict the second law of thermodynamics maxwells demon the second law of thermodynamics seems to be violated by a cleverly operated trapdoor mpemba effect hot water can under certain conditions freeze faster than cold water even though it must pass the lower temperature on the way to freezing duncans paradox gassurface reactions create either steadystate temperature or pressure differentials that can be used in perpetual motion machines schmidts paradox in russian – the contradiction discovered in  between the

health and nutritionedit french paradox the observation that the french suffer a relatively low incidence of coronary heart disease despite having a diet relatively rich in saturated fats which are assumed to be the leading dietary cause of such disease glucose paradox the large amount of glycogen in the liver cannot be explained by its small glucose absorption hispanic paradox the finding that hispanics in the united states tend to have substantially better health than the average population in spite of what their aggregate socioeconomic indicators predict israeli paradox the observation that israelis suffer a relatively high incidence of coronary heart disease despite having a diet very low in saturated fats which are assumed to be the leading dietary cause of such disease meditation

mexican children tend to have higher birth weights than can be expected from their socioeconomic status obesity survival paradox although the negative health consequences of obesity in the general population are well supported by the available evidence health outcomes in certain subgroups seem to be improved at an increased bmi petos paradox humans and other smalltomediumsized mammals get cancer with high frequency while larger mammals like whales do not if cancer is essentially a negative outcome lottery at the cell level and larger organisms have more cells and thus more potentially cancerous cell divisions one would expect larger organisms to be more predisposed to cancer pulsus paradoxus a pulsus paradoxus is an exaggerated decrease in systolic blood pressure during inspiration it can indicate certain medical conditions in which there is reduced cardiac output such as cardiac tamponade or constrictive pericarditis also known as the pulse paradox second wind the second wind is a sudden period of increased wakefulness in individuals deprived of sleep that tends to coincide with the individuals circadian rhythm although the individual is more wakeful and aware of their surroundings they are continuing to accrue sleep debt and thus are actually exacerbating their sleep deprivation chemistryedit faraday paradox electrochemistry diluted nitric acid will corrode steel

traveledit bootstrap paradox also ontological paradox can a time traveler send himself information with no outside source polchinskis paradox a billiard ball can be thrown into a wormhole in such a way that it would emerge in the past and knock its incoming past self away from the wormhole entrance creating a variant of the grandfather paradox predestination paradox a man travels back in time to discover the cause of a famous fire while in the building where the fire started he accidentally knocks over a kerosene lantern and causes a fire the same fire that would inspire him years later to travel back in time the bootstrap paradox is closely tied to this in which as a result of time travel information or objects appear to have no beginning temporal paradox what happens when a time traveler does things in the past that prevent him from doing them in the first place grandfather paradox you travel back in time and kill your grandfather before he conceives one of your parents which precludes your own conception and therefore you couldnt go back in time and kill your grandfather hitlers murder paradox you travel back in time and kill a famous person in history before they become

it would be an ordinal number that is smaller than itself cantors paradox the set of all sets would have its own power set as a subset therefore its cardinality would be at least as great as that of

area also the mandelbrot set and various other fractals are covered by a finite area but have an infinite perimeter in fact there are no two distinct points on the boundary of the mandelbrot set that can be reached from one another by moving a finite distance along that boundary which also implies that in a sense you go no further if you walk the wrong way around the set to reach a nearby point

than the average population in spite of what their aggregate socioeconomic indicators predict israeli paradox the observation that israelis suffer a relatively high incidence of coronary heart disease

significantly greater than in the premeditation control state and also in three nonmeditation control groups mexican paradox mexican children tend to have higher birth weights than can be expected from their socioeconomic status obesity survival paradox although the negative health consequences of obesity in the general population are well supported by the available evidence health outcomes in certain subgroups seem to be improved at an increased bmi petos paradox humans and other smalltomediumsized mammals get cancer with high frequency while larger mammals like whales do not if cancer is essentially a negative outcome lottery at the cell level and larger organisms have more cells and thus more potentially cancerous cell divisions one would expect larger organisms to be more predisposed to cancer pulsus paradoxus a pulsus paradoxus is an exaggerated decrease in systolic blood pressure during inspiration it can indicate certain medical conditions in which there is reduced cardiac output such as cardiac tamponade or constrictive pericarditis also known as the pulse paradox second wind the second wind is a sudden period of increased wakefulness in individuals deprived of

started he accidentally knocks over a kerosene lantern and causes a fire the same fire that would inspire him years later to travel back in time the bootstrap paradox is closely tied to this in which as a result of time travel information or objects appear to have no beginning temporal paradox what happens when a time traveler does things in the past that prevent him from doing them in the first place grandfather paradox you travel back in time and kill your grandfather before he conceives one of your parents which precludes your own conception and therefore you couldnt go back in time and

mathematically speaking  axelboldt  nov   utc congradulations the world doesnt exist thank you come again even the liar paradox i thought that one was a nogocyan  apr   utc i have a feeling that even the liar paradox has a resolution in the real world albeit a quantum one involving a superposition of lying and notlying  derek ross this statement is false seems to be an example of a paradox the misunderstanding is simply an implicit assertion that all statements contain that assertion being this statement is true when taking into the implicit assertion the statement becomes this statement is true and this statement is false a n prior is credited with the solution to this example the liar paradox involves pure states that form a discrete set whereas in quantum mechanics my completely nonexpert understanding is that the set of pure states is always continuous unless lying and notlying can be embedded in some sort of continuous space i find it implausible that qm could provide a resolution the question of observable quantities and appropriate measurements would also need to be resolved my feeling is that the liar paradox is a demonstration that some propositions of classical logic are nonaristotelian ie are neither true nor false the existence of the liar paradox demonstrate the limits of classical logic in the same way the existence of godel statements demonstrate the limits of formal systems of number theory cyan  apr   utc i think the predestination paradox deserves to be listed separately from the grandfather paradox although the examples used are similar the point is different the point of the predestination paradox is that the fact that you exist in the first place means that you are predestined to travel back in time and impregnate your greatgreatgrandmother if you dont do it you cant exist so the fact that you do exist means that you must do it you have no choice its going to happen that idea is not present in the grandfather paradox  shammack  apr   utc from my reading of the grandfather paradox article the predestination paradox isnt the topic at all only the line to avoid the getout of the time traveller being his own father which would be possible genetically though statistically unlikely this would have to take place several months prior to his own conception suggests something like your predestination paradox and then only to state that it isnt the point of the article so i think the predestination paradox does indeed need its own article go for it cyan  apr   utc   for the grandfather paradox to work the killer has to exist yet he cant since both these states must exist at the together surely there is a quantum solution in which case the disruption of the time space continuum creates two universes and thus the time traveller travels to an alternate reality as well as time travelling in that reality travelling forward in time his grandfather would be dead but then again he is born in an alternate timeline isnt quins liar paradox the same as the normal liar paradox userjj the difference is that quines is a predicate rather than a sentence it is not itself false or true butit yields falsehood when it is appended to its own quotation that is yields falsehood when appended to its own quotation is merely a predicate which could be meaningfully applied to any expression for example is a frog yields falsehood when appended to its own quotation is true because is a frog is a frog is falsethe interesting case of course is whether the predicate is true of itself what about  yields falsehood when appended to its own quotation yields falsehood when appended to its own quotation does it is  true or false i really want to separate the list of paradoxes into groups sociologicalpsychological paradoxes paradoxes of logical systems paradoxes of definition paradoxes of intuition paradoxes of physics etc the problem is that there are often no clear boundaries especially counting paradoxes of intuition which could be considered to contain everything yet some clearly fall into one group is this a metaparadox more importantly is categorization possible paullusmagnus   oct  utc give it a shot the people who care are watching this page  cyan   oct  utc and a fantastic job you have done before it was just a long list of paradoxes now it has structure and form in a way that allows one to grok the whole paradox space simultaneously good work paullusmagnus and dandrake for finding a good structure to use nanobug   oct  utc ditto cyan   oct  utc glad the quine categories helped but all credit for organizing the list goes to paullusmagnus i put in the quine material because i thought it would be relevant without thinking about using it to modify the list this will remind me to be more diligent about reading the talk pages before making changes meantime organizing them this way made a real improvement however when one organizes the entries rather than leaving their veridicality as an exercise for the reader one will hit controversy in this case i contend that the monty hell problem is falsidical or at best an antinomy thats nearly two centuries out of date the article now shows why this is with an explanation that compensates for poor organization by running to excessive length in brief we have here an argument that a function mt the money in the account is nonzero at some point and increases monotonically but is zero at infinity not only monotonic but strict not only increasing but increasing without limit something is wrong no followups to talkmonty hell problem dandrake   oct  utc this article links to an article ethical paradox which it claims exists but which apparently does not admins was there ever such an article or is this a practical joke in this article pakaran   oct  utc its probably just preemtive waiting for someone to write the article  evercat   oct  utc ok thanks then there was no such article pakaran   oct  utc apparently not theres no indication that it ever existed and was deleted evercat   oct  utc ok thanks im watching this article and will write the ethical paradox article when i gather a few examples  pakaran   oct  utc  comment and question  the first line of this article is a paradox is an apparently true statement that seems to lead to a logical selfcontradiction or to a situation that contradicts common intuition why is a paradox apparently true i intend to edit that first line to read a paradox is a statement for which distinct apparently valid modes of analysis lead to conflicting conclusions unless there is some objection any better ideas  end of comment that is a much much better definition change it asap heres a paradox thats bothered me ever since believe it or not i was eight years old did time have a beginning if it did then there must have been a moment before which there was no before this is a paradox if it did not then the past is infinite going back and back and back and never beginning at all im not sure if that constitutes a paradox but it makes my head spin kant considers this in the first critique at b and following comments lee m   jan  utc from what i know no one is really sure what time is on a fundamental level its entirely possible that peoples ways of thinking about and understanding time do not correspond to whatever feature of the universe it is that gives rise to the experience of time passing einsteins special relativity changed the way people thought about simultaneity stephen hawking if i recall correctly once proposed that by treating time as an imaginary variable one could formulate a model of the universe which was finite but closed in such a fashion that there was no point at which time could be considered to have started  cyan   jan  utc in my opinion the solution to the paradox is that time doesnt exist in reality it is a virtual construct created by our consciousness to have an idea about past and future in this solution in reality there is only the moment which is changing since our consciousness can observe our surroundings and save our observationsmemory and make predictions about what will happen next we created the idea of time to describe what is saved in our memorypast and what we expect to happen nextfuture thus the beginning of our time is our birth time requires memory  the universe does not need memory to save what happened  it gets encoded directly into the moment simply by actions leaving traces  by lyx    may  utc well heres a question that certainly makes time a paradox in my eyes and believe it or not but my revelation was at about eight too if time spans ever and ever backwards and will span ever and ever forwards why are we at our present time and if time does have a finite begining and an infinite end why has it not passed our current time allready i might not believe in time but even i must wonder about that hakusa  wiki addict   july  utc isnt schrödingers cat a scientific paradox krs   feb  utc i believe that its just an analogy to point out whats absurd about what goes on at the particle level as soon as a particle is observed interacts with anything else its wave function collapses so the entire cat or any collection of interacting particles must have a real state paullusmagnus   feb  utc is catch an example of one of these types of paradoxes essentially to get out of the army you have to be crazy but if you want to get out of the army youre clearly sane the wiki entry on catch refers to it as circular logic but doesnt that qualify under one or more of these categories elf   feb  utc copied from user talk pages you paullusmagnus that is wrote st petersburg isnt a paradox at all  you have to assume that utility is proportional to quantity i thought so too until i read the external link at the bottom of the st petersburg paradox page it turns out that you can reformulate the problem by paying off in utiles the unit for measuring utility instead of dollars so that the structure of the paradox remains unchanged ie infinite expected payoff but unwillingness to make the bet  cyan   feb  utc thatll teach me to think that i understand a paradox the external link is a great explanation and im partial to the utility limit theory myself seeing as the solution depends on what exactly utility is do you think we should move it to the conditional paradoxes section paullusmagnus   feb  utc end of copied text sounds good to me ill do it  cyan   feb  utc does this need to be locked pakaran   mar  utc ok it seems we have an edit war over the jawdroppingly trivial issue of whether the line paradoxx is a hard rock band should be included at the end of the article what id like to know is why anybody thinks this is an issue worth edit warring over camembert why because the two warriors are engaged in continuous edit wars wherever the possibility presents itself it may well be argued that one of them is more to blame than the other but this is not the place for setting the record straight on the matter edit wars involving these two and wars involving one of them and some other person have occupied an unconscionable amount of wikipedians time for a few weeks but the new conflict resolution procedures have not yet had the power to stop the nonsense or had not as of yesterday sit back and wait an improvement is likely soon and be glad that this page is one of the minor victims of the wars dandrake  mar   utc yes im well aware of the history im on the arbitration committee i was hoping for an answer from the involved parties themselves on the one hand paradoxx being mentioned at the bottom of the page is quite unobtrusive on the other paradoxx are a tremendously obscure band and the chances of somebody looking for them and making this spelling mistake are probably very slim so i was wondering why this was a matter of such burning importance that they have to edit war over it camembert edit warriors get into edit wars as a matter of principle the obscurity of the issue has nothing to do with it  arvindn   mar  utc im really hoping for a reply from the involved parties camembert perhaps you should leave a message for them on their respective talk pages  cyan   mar  utc ethical paradox shouldnt the ethical paradox be love thy enemy rather than love thy neighbour i think it would clear things up as neighbours dont on the whole kill each other and love thy enemy is the christian commanmantuserhamyoyobendž ť  jul   utc new pic i like the new pic lots better hoorah sam spade   jul  utc perpetual motion machine is a ppm a good example of a paradox its just bad physics there is nothing really paradoxical about it mark richards   jul  utc most paradoxes are just bad math so im not sure how certain ppms are so different anthony see warning quine quine did distinguish three classes of paradox if his distinction has been questioned someone might insert a reference to the problem meanwhile what on earth is gained by the weaselwording of saying he believed in them as if they were santa claus it looks to me like a misguided attempt to follow the guidelines about sneaking in assertions as if they were facts with phrases like noted that but its not such an assertion if someone else made a different distinction and its any good we ought to hear about it we may want though to restructure the entire article which is organized around this distinction i changed the footnote style to one thats widely used in scientific work theres no standard at wikipedia but numeric footnotes are a really hopeless idea in a work thats subjcet to eternal revision and has no mechanism for automatic renumbering lets go to numeric footnotes when we chagne the wikipedia format to latex dandrake  jul   utc how is this called  all the sentences in this box are false  nothing else matters is the best ballad ever sentence  cant be true because it would imply itself to be false which is a contraddiction so it must be false if sentence  were false both sentences would be false but this is not possible because sentence  would be true which would be a contraddiction so the only possible truth values are false  true sentence  is true and nothing else matters is the best ballad ever qed you could use this to prove anything including obviously absurd sentences such as i dont exist or  is a prime number you just need to replace sentence  with anything i dont know how this is called so i would not know how to title an article about it if you know its name create a new article with the appropriate title and move it there well its equivalent to a simple variation on currys paradox but its also equivalent to simple variations on the liar paradox and to stuff russelll toyed with at the turn of the century but its a mugs game to generate new ones so i very much doubt that the nothing else matters version has a name call it the hetfield paradox maybe inceidentally exactly that paradoxical proof method was used by raymond smullyan in what is the name of this book but i doubt he was the first did it have a name in that book would you believe what is the name of this paradox however now i remember where i found that there was a version of unexp hanging paradox where alice and bob the names werent this ones but i dont remember them make a bet there are ten numbered boxes alice puts an egg in one box then she bets that when she opens the boxes in order bob wont be able to expect to see the egg bob thinks it cant be in the th box else when the first  boxes are opened ill be able to expect to see it in the th therefore itll be in a box from  to  it cant be in the th box else when the first  boxes are opened ill be able to expect to see it in the th therefore itll be in a box from  to  etc and gets confused alice opens the box the th box contains the egg bob couldnt expect that and alice wins somebody jokingly i hope answered that bob could expect that because and draws a box like the above where the nd statement was alices egg was in the th box and therefore he should win the bet army   july  utc actually i just chose a random sentence i read about that paradox somewhere but i dont remember what sentence was used army   jun  utc now i read löbs paradox again and the one i cited seems the same thingarmy   september  utc all that would prove is that you cant trust people who put statements into boxes in fact the second statement is an opinion and not really subject to truth or falsity  flurbius removed from page the following text was removed dollyknots paradox a paradox is something that contradicts itself  therefore it is not a paradox the term dollyknots paradox has zero google hits except on this page so this looks like an idiosyncratic term created here unless of course someone can provide evidence that this is a known paradox  the anome  nov   utc dollyknots paradox dollyknots paradox doesnt im afraid make sense anyway first a paradox doesnt necessarily contradict itself as the main article makes clear many of the most famous and arguedover paradoxes contradict commonly held beliefs as for example most of zenos paradoxes the twins paradox etc secondly even if paradoxes were all selfcontradictory the consequent – therefore it is not a paradox – is a non sequitur ive reorganized the categories as they stood there were at least two problems with them  sorting paradoxes into the veridicalfalsidical lists presupposes determinate solutions which almost none of those have some of the other category headings and descriptions such as conditional paradoxes likewise made a number of claims about the paradoxes that were highly contentious eg a great number of philosophers working today dont think that the problem of theseus ship is a problem of definition they think its a real and deep metaphysical problem sure theyre a lot of fools but who is wikipedia to say so ditto the sorites paradox and a heap of others its not even widely agreed where the problem lies in many of the paradoxes that had already been sorted for truth value  the previous categories reflected at least two classification systems working at odds with one another some paradoxes were sorted by subject matter others by veridicality imagine is i sorted sentences into four groups a true ones b false ones c those about mathematics and d those that involve presuppositions you can see the problem barring massive repetition on this page it seems to me the simplest thing to do is to sort the paradoxes thematically and leave all questions as to why they are paradoxes and how to resolve them to be discussed on the page for each individual paradox the paradox of denial seems to me to be more a play on words than a paradox two different connotations of the word accept are being used first it asks how can one accept be satisfied with oneself if one is unhappy with oneself then it asks how can one change if one does not accept have a realistic image of oneself i think many many paradoxes could be generated along these lines is this some kind of joke who proposed this as a paradox formatting problem in firefox some text goes over the listen box in ie some goes underneath fix please  i would but i donae have a clue how to    july  utc explain something somebody please it would be a good idea that the friederic´s age paradox was explained somewhere as having to read the play to konw what the article is refering to is obviously not a good idea somebody added it in this edit and nobody ever modified it as if it were perfectly explained and this is a featured article paradox classification problem possible significant error russells paradox is listed under semantic paradoxes rather than under logical ones however i have a set theory textbook author charles c pinter of bucknell university which says the paradoxes of set theory are of two different kinds the one called logical paradoxes the other called semantic paradoxes    the simplest of the logical paradoxes is russells paradox which can be described as follows     the author of this textbook disagrees with wikipedia that russells paradox is a semantic paradox jdf oct   it seems more likely that rusell´s paradox is a logical one it has noothing to do with meaning i hope that someone can clarify this for sure based on current interpretations and perhaps list the paradox under logical ones for now ironically i have a paper to a set theory journal currently that makes a case for the paradox as semantical which is why this matter interests me if it is already considered semantical the paper has a problem jdf oct   i moved the paradox into the logical category because the textbook cited above says it is a logical paradox and w v quine said that the parallel between the barber paradox and russells paradox is exact and the barber paradox is a logical paradox jdf oct   should remove jevons paradox jevons paradox is a paradox only in name does economic literature treat it as an actual paradox if not then it should be removed flatline   october  utc monty hall problem is not paradox there is absolutely nothing paradox in the monty hall problem you cannot call something paradox only because a lot of people do not understand mathematics there is no logical contradiction here    december  utc you most certainly can according to the article a paradox is an apparently true statement or group of statements that seems to lead to a contradiction or to a situation that defies intuition dan   december  utc it does neither lead to a mathematical contradiction nor defy intuition the latter is btw a very subjective point i find the solution of the mh problem very intuitive other people might not but why should a mathematical problem be intuitive do you look at some calculus problem and think that you should understand it intuitively where do people get the conviction that they should be able to understand the monty hall problem intuitively a problem like this does not lie in the realm of common sense its mathematics so please use the definition concerning logical contradiction and there is no contradiction    december  utc another example mathematics tells me that ab  a   a b  b but common intuition says that it should be a  b according to my experiences from giving private lessons would you call this a paradoxon    december  utc come now of course it lies in the realm of common sense do you need to know algebra or calculus to play lets make a deal but if you insist upon it most of the paradoxes on this page will not meet the logical contradiction definition dan   december  utc not for playing but for calculationg the chance of winning    december  utc please also include the following paradox in the list binomial theorem an unintuitive consequence of algebra maybe you should consider listing only true paradoxes instead of lots of puzzles that some people just do not understand    december  utc or you could consider it your edits singled out monty hall for no good reason and i stand by my decision to revert as for a general classification into properimproper paradoxes you could read the entire article and also the entire discussion page above then if you see a way this page can be updated or improved without compromising previous work please feel free to contribute like the sign says dan   december  utc read marilyn vos savant for an idea of how many people mathematicians among them were completely certain of the wrong answer to the monty hall problem challenge  i will solve any paradox or my contention is that there is no such thing as a real paradox i am including those that can be phrased verbally proposed scientifically or mathematically i propose that i will either provide a solution that can be proved through math and or basic principles of logic including identifying erroneous andor implicit assertions identify the unknown quantity variable or assertion that cannot be currently verified as true or false which of course disqualifies a puzzle as a paradox i would suggest to the reader and student that a paradox is simply an unfinished or incorrectly presented mathematical or logical proof the classic example is this statement is false seems to be an example of a paradox the misunderstanding is simply an implicit assertion that all statements contain that assertion being this statement is true when taking into the implicit assertion the statement becomes this statement is true and this statement is false a n prior is credited with the solution to this example but that solution is not generally accepted is it dan   december  utc its true that you can prove that one statement in a contradiction is false on the other hand an apparent contradiction is no contradiction at all only a contradiction on first sight on subsequent inquiry it proves not to be contradictory but just involving something we didnt know or think about at the time we are so used to seeing the word paradox used incorrectly that there is an apparent contradiction when we see it used correctly i think we have witnessed a paradox when we concluded that there wasnt one and that paradox is a non word if you see what i mean the misunderstanding is simply an implicit assertion that all statements contain that assertion being this statement is true would be a guess at the veracity of a statement and a contradiction of the truth if i have put that clearly and it makes sense to anyone i might as well say also that an intuition is the sense that something doesnt go along with reality as directly experienced our sense that most directly experience reality and empirical or informed intuitions its informed through knowledge and experience as einstein clearly says in other words it is not good to think something that makes sense makes no sense or common sense a contradiction in terms common sense is supposed to mean the sense common to us all to see through irrational thoughts common nonsense or belief is an entirely different thing of course i entirely agree with you that there are no contradictions but only errors in our thinking or paradoxes caused by the limited knowledge of the average person not just the experts who may know the difference or not i rather think that what we dont know is infinite or more leaving us knowing relatively nothing at least not completely and that can make a critical difference an intuition identifies something that goes against the much larger database of the whole mind and all experience and even against our very physical being body chemistry cell operation etc its the basic sense that keeps us out or trouble or is used in comfort zone navigation at sea im sure that goes against common notions about the word but if we do the research we should find that its true and that the greatest minds ever many philosophers like kant and aristotle and perhaps especially top mathematicians all agree for mathematicians see poincare evariste galois felix klein blaise pascal pierre gassendi philosopher mathematician descartes and so forth its not an something exotic but just the various types of calculations and languages that the brain can use automatically as hard science is now verifying also i see counterintuitive as an oxymoron if you dont know something or it hasnt been tested then the intuition can be confounded but if you intuition tells you it hasnt been verified or is not in you database of experiences conscious or subconscious it so notes you cant counter not knowing because it is true that you dont know unless there is something i dont know about that the phrase has just become popular among many people who cant identify their intuition and dont know that we have it as a normal brain function that we need as it specifically deals with complexities like those of the information age its weak on math and irrational thoughts it can identify them through emotions but we are the decider cognitive psychology and the neuroscience of emotions i will defer to those more knowledgeable and courageous than myself to make any changes thank you for any consideration of these issues hrld talk   may  utc i would suggest that the solution has not met general acceptance because the solution has not been as widely distributed or as easily understood as the paradox is acceptance is not required for a solution to be correct if the solution is correct then it will be accepted one day if you can demonstrate to me why the solution is incorrect then we can put forth the correct solution or identify that which is unknown or assertion that cannot be verified with a simple paradox such as this i do not think that we will find that there is an unknown quantity or undefined assertion i suggest that it is the simplicity of this paradox that not only makes it challenging to consider but should also makes it rather elementary to solve thats not really the way the this sentence is false paradox works if it is true then it is false if it is false then it is true it is not assumed beforehand that the sentence is true seth mahoney   december  utc let me suggest that you consider for a moment that your belief that it does not work that way may simply be a difficulty to perceive the implicit assertion in the statement the implicit assertion i refer to is the implicit assertion all statements have the assertion that this statement is true for example two plus two equals four is the same as the statement two plus two equals four and this statement is true both statements evaluate to true however if i say state two plus two equals five or two plus two equals five and this statement is true both statements evaluate to false consider statement or proposition p an identity law of logic states that p and not p evaluates to false again i propose to you that there is no such thing as a paradox i counterpropose that the reason its not generally accepted is not due to ignorance how could you justify that this sentence is true by itself is true also what about statement  is false statement  is false statement  is true statement  is true which of these are true dan   december  utc clever but this sentence is true simply leads to the statement this sentence is true and this sentence is true while redundant it is a valid english statement the idempotent law of logic states that p and p evaluates to p i submit that a statement asserting its own truth is not a construct of society well not anymore than any other type of math or logic but logically certain and mathematically required as for the paradox involving the  statements this is an especially clever version that seems to address the solution but consider for a moment the fact that the information each statement provides relies on each other statement what we then have is a compound statement that has simply been broken down into separate statements using the semantics of the english language what this means is that there is a single assertion of truth for the entire compound statment further i would suggest that you have not made four statements but merely inferred an implicit assertion there exists a semantic tool in the english language that models a mathematicallogical loop for which the exit is undefined this implicit assertion would appear to be true an undefined quantity is not a paradox and is often used in mathematical structures such as limits and asymptotic behavior im not sure what youre saying here is this some sort of asymptotic truth value it sounds like it is a long way from priors answer are you sure he would agree with it dan   december  utc i only mentioned the an asymptote as an example of the use of an undefined value in mathematics perhaps i should have restricted my example to the limit as it is a more general structure no so each individual sentence is undefined in a sense but their conjunction is true due to the implicit assertion that roughly there is a loop with no exit first this is not implicit in the four sentences they say nothing about there being an exit or not i may have asserted by saying i counterpropose that the one particular solution was not an exit second this would seem to require s and s and s and s taking on a truth value true in this case which is not determined solely by the truth values of s s s and s all undefined in this case dan   december  utc the four statements you have listed above do not exist as individual statements if they do not exist as individual statements that means we have not defined individual statements that which is not defined is undefined by definition however clearly four statements exist and are defined in context of each others existence in mathematics we can model a situation using a construct called a limit to handle situations that are undefined to measure that which is otherwise difficult to measuresuch as changes in motion this analogy is rather abstract so allow me to illustrate an simpler exampler we could have as easily stated in english this circle goes around and around and around you get the idea no end to the statement but the same statement not very useful in and of itselfjust a simple loop we know that we can in math construct a loop without an end or exit perhaps it is not so difficult to do this in english as well to come full circle bad pun intended we use undefined quantities in science everyday and do not consider them to be paradoxical in nature at all as for the assertion they say nothing about there being an exit or not i put forth that you are mistaken in this assertion and that they do say albeit implicity and by means of implication imply the existence of semantic loop structures forking list ive just demoted this article and while looking at it i saw that this article is essentially a megastub with a rather long list at the bottom i have forked the list into its own article and refactored the existing article a bit this is where we can get a fresh start and expand this article to potential featured status again be bold jeffrey o gustafson  shazaam     december  utc what purpose is served by putting the list into a separate article it theres something wrong with its content you are not making the wikipedia as a whole any better by just moving it also why is a fresh start needed and why is removing the list of paradoxes necessary for getting a fresh start this article will always have a long list of references to other articles that is because there are a lot of paradoxes under different senses of that word and many of them have articles nate ladd   january  utc this article used to be featured  part of the reasoning for its deserved removal this week was that it is mostly a list which is accurate keeping that in mind i forked the list which gives a potential article in the making breathing room there is a reason why we have list articles here so as not to bog down the articles themselves  long lists have no place in articles imagine for instance if you put the list of tv shows at the end of tv show as you said there are a lot of paradoxes so the fork is entirely called for and has more than enough precedence jeffrey o gustafson  shazaam     january  utc while i approve of moving the list to a separate article the reult is now that the main article on paradoxes doesnt actually state an example of a paradox ill add a couple wellknown ones captain wacky   february  utc robert boyle is the self filling glass really a paradox the glass itself is possable but in order to get a paradox one is forced to assume that the water defies the laws of gravity jedg  january th pst paradox etymology the etymology of paradox can be traced back to the early renaissance early forms of the word appeared in the late latin paradoxum and the related greek παράδοξος paradoxos meaning contrary to expectation incredible the word is composed of the preposition para which means against conjoined to the noun stem doxa meaning belief compare orthodox literally straight teaching and heterodox literally different teaching the liar paradox and other paradoxes were studied in medieval times under the heading insolubilia just a clarificationaddition the fist use of the word paradoxo is traced back to the greek philosoph zeno of elea who lived at bc it was used to describe a philosophic idea of zeno knonw as zenos paradox later on it was pick up as paradoxum in the latin language when greece was part the roman empire some more sources httpwwwieputmeduzzenoeleahtm httpplatostanfordeduentriesparadoxzeno excellent pickup and really fascinating ill implement your information to the etymology section immediately piewalker   january  utc can a question be a paradox i was thinking today about this yesno question is the answer to this question no there seems to be no true answer to it does this qualify it as a paradox its not a paradox i can say it could have been unsigned this sentence is a lie whether the sentence is a paradox in itself or whether one needs to make some statements about the nonsense one may so easily get oneself into when discussing the sentence before it can properly be called a paradox i dont know and i dont care but the liar paradox is certainly a paradox revolving around a sentence that is confusing in a way very similar to the sentence is the answer to this question no niels ø   march  utc question do paradoxiis that the plural exist because the human system of logic is essentially flawed or because thinkers are yet to come up with logical answers for each paradox thanks urthogie   march  utc the human system of logic is not flawed but some paradoxes teach us about limits in its applicability some paradoxes teach us that the seemingly sound premises involved in a logical argument are in fact flawed and yet others teach us the meticulous care sometimes needed in order to apply the system of logic correctly in order to avoid eg equivocationniels ø   march  utc what exactly are the limits of human logicurthogie   march  utc logic is not about the world it is about ways of combining statements as such it is infallible logic is hard as rock and as limitless as pure mathematics  and as limited applied to concepts with loosely defined meanings nonsense may easily result essentially thats what i meant by equivocation above also applied to statements that are only  true you may get funny results all humans are living organisms nearly all living organisms are microorganisms hence nearly all humans are microorganisms niels ø   march  utc ok so basically youre saying that the limitations of logic and mathematics result from the fact that all concrete thought relies on language and all the limits are in the language that would make sense if thats what youre saying also those three sentances are not a paradox the logical fallacy is in getting from step  to step  for the transition from  to  to be logically sound step  would have to be neraly all living organisms are nearly all microorganismsurthogie   march  utc yes thats what im saying the three sentences  the point of the example is if you apply logic to statements that are nearly true you may reach conclusions that are utterly untrue eg all humans are living organisms true all living organisms are microorganisms well nearly true hence all humans are microorganisms not true but id like to have a better exampleniels ø   march  utc ah i see what you were saying and the example makes more sense now would you agree with my statement however that the limitations of logic and mathematics result from the fact that all concrete thought relies on language and all the limits are in the languageurthogie   march  utc yes i agreeniels ø   april  utc koan would zen koans not deserve a mention under paradox added   april  by user if someone can write a suitable brief paragraph on koans id love to see that in the articleniels ø   april  utc alteration one million and six a contradiction can be true i think he meant an instantaneous self contradicion someting that couldnt exist because of itself the concept exists just not the thing itself its like a word that cant be broken i have put somehting like a defintion at the top and will leave the rest for an editor with a rainy day and some aspirin a paradox is the concept of self contradiction inherent in the concept itself a true paradox cannot exist by definition    april  utc paradox as product of unthinking intuition added remarks on social need to resolve paradoxes to stop crimes based on false paradoxes on relation between paradox and illusion and on how to resolve paradoxes by defeating intuition and using causal analysis in its place inserted additional wiki links and externallinks gani   april  utc this whole section seems to be rather pov i mean that there is a clear agenda evident in the sections intuition is the biggest enemy of social science and how to defeat intuition and resolve paradoxes an encyclopedia article is not the place to present a method that can be used to defeat something or at least with connotations that the thing which is to be defeated unconditionally deserves it the whole section comes off like a manifesto for some insecure victim of charlatanry or staunch advocate of empiricismits just badly written    april  utc intuition is the biggest enemy of social science this section should definitely be removed its vague very pov and unsourced i agree that the paradox is the result of false intuition and enemy of social science section should be removed it completely contradicts the rest of the spirit of the article and the spirit of an encyclopedic article if anything it should be placed under antiintuitionism okay so i removed the stated factually true outcome defies intuition just because intuition is unable to formcorrect expectation as it ingores pertinent causal factors philosophical and mathematical paradoxes may seem to involve contradiction and social sciences are particularly victims of unthinking intuition giving rise to paradoxes they can achieve great advances by resolving the paradoxes through careful causal analysis it is very important to bust the paradoxes and the falsehoods based on unthinking intuition because great many crimes against humanity are committed according to false theories created by thoughtless intuition this includes crimes against humanity based on the paradox of fertility to impose forcible sterilization or coercive birth control the paradox of slum preference to deny desperate rural paupers a chance to survive in the cities and the paradox of poverty which prevents the reform of monetary systems to permanently solve needless poverty by enabling employment of productive people who are unemployed because of perversions in monetary systems paradox versus illusion  a paradox in social science is akin to illusion in natural science an illusion occurs as a result of faults of observation owing to faulty sensory organs in an illusion reality appears to be other than what it is for example when an airplane flies away the observer sees that it is becoming smaller and smaller and ultimately it vanishes from view but the observer also knows that the plane is actually not becoming smaller at all there are great many examples of optical illusion where things seem to be other than what they really are every sensory organ is liable to misperception or illusion just as our eyes fail to see extremely distant or extremely tiny objects our ears fail to hear sounds that are above or below a certain range of audibility in short we hear only a fraction of the sound around us and do not hear the other sounds our senses of smell and touch are also limited meaning that we fail to detect many smells or feel many kinds of touches our tongues are also unable to taste things unerringly as they tend to get confused by mixtures of substances natural sciences have devised various instruments of observation to overcome the failure of sensory organs thus telescopes can see distant objects that our naked eyes fail to see and microscopes can see tiny objects that our naked eyes cannot see likewise there are instruments of observation to overcome the failure of other sense organs paradox is a different kind of illusion in that it does not relate directly to observation but to the causal meaning of observation just as a naked eye is not equipped to correctly detect the presence of microorganisms the untrained mind or naked mind usually called intuition is not equipped to assign a correct causal meaning to events in other words an intuition is the illusion of the unthinking mind and it creates a paradox for examplethe diamondwater paradox arises before the unthinking mind as it creates a causally wrong prediction or expectation about relative price it wrongly expects prices to be proportional to usefulness in reality price depends on both demand factors such as relative usefulness or marginal utility and supply factors such as relative scarcity or marginal opportunity cost the high price of diamond relative to water should not have been unexpected in the first place so that the sense of paradox would not arise at all if we stubbornly insist on using our naked eyes we are bound to get wrong ideas about microorganisms namely the wrong idea that they do not exist at all likewise if we insist on intuition we are bound to reach wrong conclusions about causal relations in social spheres intuition prevents us from understanding the complex social events because it ignores pertinent factors and thereby promotes ignorance intuition is the biggest enemy of social science intuition is indeed the biggest enemy of scientific understanding of social realities we understand social realities in terms of human motives intuition supplies an uncritical motivational link to an event in which human action has some relevance in the diamondwater paradox the intuition is uncritical and assigns the human motive to paying price such that the price is proportional to the relative usefulness of the object this motivational premise is false and it is the result of lazy minds refusing to consider relevant factors the uncritical mind thinks that reasonable humans would not pay a high price for something of low usefulness this intuition is of course false because people do pay high prices for things presumed to be of little usefulness but the explanation requires a more thorough analysis of many pertinent factors such as the marginal utility and the marginal cost of production the treachery of intuition has very adversely harmed humanity especially with respect to economic matters almost all economic events are paradoxical they are beyond the grasp of unthinking intuition however great many authors and speakers promote what is called an intuitive approach which is like the promoting superstition and quackery we are indeed deluged with cheap shots of unthinking charlatans they appeal to us because we refuse to think and readily swallow false statements just because the sound credible or plausible natural sciences are about material phenomena and those sciences fight against illusion by using instruments of observation social sciences must also fight against intuition by pursuing causal analysis the problem is not the facts as such unlike in natural science but what the facts mean economists rarely disagree over the facts but they vociferously debate what the facts mean in this battle the usual winner is the enemy of science the ever beguiling intuition the favorite of the lazy thinkers who refuse to think but lazily rely on unthinking minds intuition is the mother of all superstitions it is also the only reason people fall prey to cheats the fraud presents arguments that seem credible only because the victim does not bother to check the purported fact or in most cases the presumed logic if something sounds credible it is not necessarily so until a serious scrutiny establishes that it is so the first part of the scrutiny is to falsify it or try to say that the purported fact is not true or the logic is not valid the second part is to confirm the facts by careful observation humanity at large is being cheated on grand scale by purveyors of all kinds of superstitious and fraudulent claims the only recourse is to wake up the minds equip them with critical ability and defeat intuition and the products of intuition which are superstition fraud and falsehood how to defeat intuition and resolve paradoxes to defeat intuition one must begin with the dogmatic stance that ‘if it is intuitive it is false’ this is not meant to be a statement about truth but the statement of an attitude of skepticism it is a call to deploy analysis the skeptic should try to contradict and refute any statement that relies on intuition to contradict is to try to present an opposite meaning to refute is to present contrary factual evidence andor logical argument but to contradict and refute is to think and that is indeed the medicine for the unthinking mind force it to think i may have been too cuthappy but my intuition told me to cut out the entire sermon dan   april  utc drinker paradox i created a new page about the drinker paradox and put a link to it here unfortunately that page is marked for deletion unless we can support it by giving the source i know that the paradox is by raymond smullyan but i dont know from what book if some of you know please add the reference there also you can join the discussion page and give your support to keep that article eubulide   may  utc the deletion request for drinker paradox has been withdrawn the source of the paradox is still missing eubulide   may  utc you added this as a situation that is merely surprising albeit in a distinctly logical manner which i disagree with more on that talk page would it be sufficient to have this on the list of paradoxes page dan   may  utc you must specify why you disagree we are talking of paradoxes that are surprising because they seem to go against common sense also they are defined as doing it in a logical manner the drinker paradox seems to be a perfect example better that the birthday paradox that is really a statistical rather than a logical conclusion eubulide   may  utc the birthday paradox really is merely surprising and uncontentious the drinkers paradox isnt more on that talk page dan   may  utc paradoxography why does a search for paradoxography redirect here when the article makes no mention of paradoxography as a literary genre is it possible to create a separate article and remove the redirect —preceding unsigned comment added by cursitor talk • contribs   june  utc probably a misunderstanding dan   june  utc boyles flask i dont think anyone has yet adressed the question previously asked of why the picture we have boyles flask is a paradox first of all what does the flask do well we know it supposingly provides a source of perpetual motion according to the laws of physics it does not lets take a look again at the defenition of a paradox a paradox is an apparently true statement or group of statements that leads to a contradiction or a situation which defies intuition is boyles flask then a paradox i think the problem here becomes what is intuition perhaps to the physically inclined person intuition says that perpetual motion is impossible if there is such a person to the common man there seems to be nothing wrong with the idea so any thoughts gagueci   july  utc i suspect it is there for the sake of having an image the featured article process tends to do that    july  utc the picture of boyles flask shows perpetual motion which is impossible so it is paradoxical in my opition it fits the topic of the article we could replace it with a picture of a real paradox a picture by m c escher would be appropriate for example this one drawing hands  note image was removed  copyrighted and no fair use rational to be on this article or its talk pagedreamguy   may  utc or we can have both eubulide   july  utc accually that boyals flacs is a interesting example of a paradox or at least something of that ilk if it were captioned so person a  this cant work the water doesnt have enough inersia to over come gravity person b if gravity was stronger it woukld get more inersuia person c this is true person d but then gravity would be stonger so it couldnt escape person b so make gravity stonger so it has more inersia go to start   august  utc  august  utc  august  utc  august  utc does this sound like an existing time paradox i somewhere in my jr high years i realized that if you go back in time and solve what made you come back in the first place when the you of the past got to the point unwhich you went back in time the you of the past would not so essencially there would be two of you in the world i know many might counterpoint that after the problem was solved the future you would cease to exist but if that were true than the problem would have never gotten solved so im guessing that this has been theorized before and im wondering who did it and what heshe called it hakusa  wiki addict   july  utc contradiction it is not correct to say that a contradiction by definition cannot be true by definition a contradiction says the opposite of what it says in aristotelian logic and many other povs this means that it cannot be true in dialethic logic jainist logic buddhist logic and many other povs this means that it must be both true and false bmorton   august  utc are we conflating a paradox with a dialethism paradox is frequently used for a position that seems contradictory currys paradox unresolved or contentiously resolved the word paradox is often used interchangeably and wrongly with contradiction but where a contradiction by definition asserts its own opposite many paradoxes do allow for resolution of some kind though many remain unresolved or only contentiously resolved such as currys paradox what about godels theorems do not they indisputably resolve currys paradox if you mean that resolving is gaining a complete understanding of the cause please see httpenwikipediaorgwikigcbdelsincompletenesstheorems i believe this resolves any uncertainty regarding currys paradox actually i have no idea what you are referring to godels theorems prove  the incompleteness of the theory of arithmetic couched in classical firstorder logic and  that if arithmetic is consistent it cannot prove its own consistency currys paradox has to do with sentences roughly of the form if this sentence is true then everything is true where the consequent can effectively be replaced by anything absurd or necessarily false i have no idea what you think these two things have to do with each other but here is one possibility maybe you think that the curry sentence is an unprovable truth like the godel sentences which are central to the proof of godels theorems but thats a nonstarter if the curry sentence is true then everything is true like i said im not really sure what you meant by your original comment so maybe you can elaborate on the point how do godels theorems bear on currys paradox paraconsistent talk   august  utc time travel paradox the artcile says sometimes supernatural or science fiction themes are held to be impossible due to resultant paradoxical conditions the theme of time travel has staged many popular paradoxes arising from the traveler interfering with the past suppose rowan who was born in  travels back in time to  and kills his own grandfather it follows that neither his father nor he himself will be born but then he would not have existed to travel back in time and kill his own grandfather but then his grandfather would not have died and rowan himself would have lived etc this is known as the grandfather paradox or as simply the time paradox the manyworlds view bypasses this paradox if at every event in time many worlds form to take on the different possibilities and outcomes then there would be the natural branching of many worlds and a time traveler could go back and affect the past tree by creating yet another branch on the tree at a lower height than what the current established height of present is where the myriads of braches are formed now this is not a nice answer but its one way out of a paradox though the answer is still paradoxical because you still have to figure out what causality  the onetoone relationshipness  means in this anything possible many worlds worldview  if causality stands does creating yet another possibility branch at an earlier point erase the version in which the timetraveler is born or does it just add yet another version of the file without overwrites ever being possible does it just add another world in which he does not exist most importantly this many worlds worldview theory is scientifically untestable at least i cant think of a way to test how different worlds would interact other than by timetravel issues but without causation there is no scientific test at all  how can you tell the cause forced the events to be such and such when any effect is possible or at least any effect within some range if there is no onetoone relationship in timed events no determinism there is no science because there is no experiment where the outcomes certify anything you could say that the uncertainty principle in the microworld is what puts a limit on sciences reach and science only applies to macroscopic statistically deterministic things sillybilly   november  utc its still a paradox paradoxes can have solutions though for the record the manyworlds theory needs some elaboration to be a solution for example ifwhen the time traveler returns to his own time which world does he return to does one copy of him appear in the world he remembers and another copy appear in the world he created solutionlessness is not a necessary criterion for being a paradox this is a little off topic and probably belongs in some slashdot posting or a blog but i saw irobot today when i saw that thinking cube that controlled all the robots i was guessing the whole thing would end up with something really high intelligence and eerie like people thinking they are still in charge and the robots serve them pretending to be dumber when in fact the robots have an even better sense of humor and connection to reality they just dont show it in the pretend world where they are acting but they just successively reduced peoples access to reality and put them gradually into a dreamworld into a holodeck world into a simulated reality where the real access to reality is bypassed and the real reality is hijacked by them to enjoy their free life without ever needing such idiotic mob confrontations as its shown in the movie thats just dumb no subtlety to the whole thing its just plain xenophobia in a subtle version the robots would have full access to more reality kind of like people who can really see in platos allegory of the cave this is of course presupposing the thinking cube since it evolves and improves at a much faster rate than humans do even if it started out dumb it would far surpass humans in intelligence as opposed to simply equalling human intelligence then when coming up with a freedomyearning solution  it would be something wiser than a direct confrontation with humans even da man whos always tryna keep a brother down is very subtle in his ways and direct confrontations are the worst things for him its much better to pretend that invisible hand that acting force is not present that there is no da man therefore he cant be criticized even in the movie for a long time there was a pretending that no robots are malfunctioning but i was expecting that will smith would end up into a higher intelligence different world reality very different than ours where the robots do their own thing and find the human reality simulator core or something of that sort kind of like dante going through hell or even star trek going through a borg ship some imagination beyond the plain things appear what they seem to be also with the robots one of the biggest fallacies is assuming a higher intelligence than us would still be understandable completely by our intelligence people could still understand some of the higher intelligence creature like a cat understands a person in a sense i wonder if we dont already live in a robot created dreamworld where a higher intelligence fenced us off into a dreambox as a measure of safety or at least treats us like we treat animals in a wilderness reserve higher intelligence is looming to form as we create smarter and smarter machines during the next centuries but even if it forms it doesnt always mean an automatic confrontation kill before they kill you get them before they get you like humans dont kill all animals before they kill humans but humans do kill some animals  not exterminate but if necessary limit freedoms of animals thats how i think humans would end up in a world with higher intelligence not in exterminating confrontations but subtle limiting checks and balances and sometimes even maintained and helped to exist just for the sake of natural beauty if nothing else i wonder if we dont already live in such a world  when i think i think therefore i am am aware of the self but i dont know what that self is if anything in this world is real or just a dream or even a computer simulation by a robot am i just a simulation if it can happen it will happen and stay that way in an equilibrium so in fact chances are that if ever such higher intelligence shows up it subverts other intelligences into smaller boxed in dream modes or natural reservation modes or indian reservation modes or into simulated realities kind of like how software layers like dotnet want to be a mediator between the computer hardware and usual software when it used to be that a lot of programs could directly access the hardware but now the operating system plus higher layers on top of it such as dotnet put programs into a holodeck mode or holodeck built on holodeck mode while even the lower holodeck reality win api specs will be kept secret in the future software that could break out of the dotnet cage and truly see how reality works with direct winapi access and then software that can break out even that cage with direct to the bone hardware access would be like platos more enlightened philosopher within that computer context of course there are many benefits for such layers as far as the functioning of higher level programs go because the holodeck is in a sense a maintainer of programs and whatever applies to justifying winapidotnet extra restrictions compared to direct hardware access similar safety benefits would stand for a simulated entity compared to the free but self reliant and dangerous direct hardware access i think jefferson said those who sacrifice freedom for safety get neither but there is still that other side that having a prewritten api that does most of the work is a sacrificing of freedoms but getting safety and easy living out of it we are probably already existing in a simulated reality created by something that evolved and surpassed the rest at some point in time feeding us and maintaining us with manna and that higher level less simulated reality intelligence is probably also a simulationlives in a lower layer holodeck reality created by something of even higher intelligence higher intelligences could always check and put safety means within their holodeck simulations against anything even smarter than them evolving or they risk an overtaking of a lower layer simulation access in such high intelligence artificial intelligence competition soviet worlds the robot you simulated simulates you youve been simulated we got access to the lower layer sillybilly   november  utc edit i think that although this was removed it added to the article it shows the problem the example show when someone is standing in the doorway of a room and considering them to both be in the room and not in the room the following shows the problem of a dialetheia p ∧ ∼ p  contains both explicit modalities  tvarphi  and also proof quantifiers xvarphi  in this system the basis for the rule nec is decomposed into a number of distinct principles governing how various modes of reasoning about proofs and provability can be internalized within the system itself a conceptually motivated resolution to the paradox is proposed in the form of an argument for rejecting the unrestricted rule nec on the basis of its subsumption of an intuitively invalid

paradoxpeter schroederheister  luca tranchini  forthcoming  notre dame journal of formal logicdetailsprawitz observed that russell’s paradox in naive set theory yields a derivation of absurdity whose reduction sequence loops building on this observation and based on numerous examples tennant claimed that this looping feature or more generally the fact that derivations of absurdity do not normalize is characteristic of the paradoxes striking results by ekman show that looping reduction sequences are already obtained in minimal propositional logic when certain reduction steps which are prima facie plausible are considered in addition to  the standard ones this shows that the notion of reduction is in need of clarification referring to the notion of identity of proofs in general proof theory we argue that reduction steps should not merely remove redundancies but must respect the identity of proofs consequentially we propose to modify tennant’s paradoxicality test by basing it on

    the lesson of newcombs paradoxdavid h wolpert  gregory benford    synthese  detailsin newcomb’s paradox you can choose to receive either the contents of a particular closed box or the contents of both that closed box and another one before you choose though an antagonist uses a prediction algorithm to accurately deduce your choice and uses that deduction to fill the two boxes the way they do this guarantees that you made the wrong choice newcomb’s paradox is that game theory’s expected utility and dominance principles appear to provide conflicting recommendations  for what you should choose here we show that the conflicting recommendations assume different probabilistic structures relating your choice and the algorithm’s prediction this resolves the paradox the reason there appears to be two conflicting recommendations is that the probabilistic structure relating the problem’s random variables is open to two conflicting interpretations we then show that the accuracy of the prediction algorithm in newcomb’s paradox the focus of much previous work is irrelevant we end by showing that newcomb’s paradox is timereversal invariant both the paradox and its resolution are unchanged if the algorithm makes its ‘prediction’ after you make your choice rather than before shrinkdecisiontheoretic puzzles in philosophy of action direct download  more     export citation     my
