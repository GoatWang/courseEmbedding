recent fall in oil commodity prices has created a buying opportunity for investors as cashstrapped oil companies seek to restore their balance sheets and begin to divest of their working interests in proven oil and gas wells private investment funds like ours can presently find opportunities in the petroleum industry that were inconceivable only a few short years ago we are now seeing opportunities to acquire prime leasehold interests in the heart of america’s energy producing areas with the price of oil near alltime lows and recent announcements by opec to limit oil production output a tremendous window of opportunity exists for fund investorsthe fund’s objectives include the targeting of an area of the oil and gas leasehold acquisition and divestiture market that tends to be relatively inefficient due to low asset valuations and are thus often overlooked by larger acquisition funds our overall objective is to realize capital appreciation and provide a sustainable
