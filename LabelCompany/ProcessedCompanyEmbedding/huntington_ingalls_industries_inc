and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible

industries inc of pascagoula mississippi and vt halter marine inc also of pascagoula protest the award of contracts to bath iron works corporation of bath maine eastern shipbuilding group inc of panama city florida and bollinger shipyards lockport llc of lockport louisiana under request for proposals rfp no hscgropc issued by the united states coast guard for design of the offshore patrol cutter huntington ingalls and vt halter marine challenge the agency’s evaluation of proposals and selection decision we deny the protests background the coast guard’s offshore patrol cutter is intended to replace the agency’s fleet of foot and foot medium endurance cutters the offshore patrol cutter will be designed to operate beyond  nautical miles offshore and carry out various missions such as security of ports waterways and coastal areas search and rescue drug interdiction and alien migrant interdiction rfp amend  § cd f contracting officer’s co statement at  the rfp stated that the coast guard would employ a twophased downselect strategy to procure the cutters phase i which is the subject of this protest provides for the award of up to three fixedprice contracts for preliminary and contract design in phase ii the phase i awardees will compete for a single contract for detailed design and ship construction rfp amend  §§ cg c offerors were informed that the phase i contracts would be awarded on a best‑value basis considering in descending order of importance concept design design approach organizational management production capability past performance small businessdepartment of homeland security mentorprotégé participation and price all nonprice factors when combined were significantly more important than price rfp amend  § mib c offerors also were informed that any proposal offering a price for phase i exceeding  million would be rejected id § mib with respect to the concept design factor offerors were informed that the agency would evaluate the soundness of the offerors’ concept designs and the extent to which it provided the basis for the development of preliminary and contract designs that satisfied offshore patrol cutter requirements id § mi in this regard the rfp identified the following “hierarchy” of requirements speed helicopter hangar storage aircraft type operating range accommodations patrol endurance small boat launchstorage capability number and foot by foot pallet storage capability number id § mid the rfp provided as an attachment a detailed system specification that among other things provided threshold requirements and objectives for these hierarchical requirements for example the rfp stated a threshold requirement for a sustained speed of  knots for the offshore patrol cutter and an objective of  knots in full load condition rfp amend  attach j‑ §  the rfp also stated as a threshold requirement the ability to launch two boats and an objective of launching an additional boat id §  with regard to past performance the rfp required offerors to submit past performance information for up to  contracts similar in size scope and complexity to the offshore patrol cutter work and in which the offerors had “participated during the past  years” id § lia offerors were also required to submit descriptive narratives that summarized the relevancy of the contracts to the offshore patrol cutter solicitation and described the performance of the offeror and its design agents the rfp informed offerors that the determination of relevancy would be based on characteristics of the past performance examples including at a minimum the following ship characteristics a dimensions length beam design draft and displacement b performance speed horse power range and endurance c propulsion plant d electrical plant e hullstructure materials f boat launch and recovery and g command control communications computers intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance cisr electronic systems id § lia offerors were advised that the agency might contact references and other past customers to verify statements and representations made in proposals and that this information might be considered more relevant than information submitted by the offerors offerors also were informed that contracts with completed deliveries may be deemed more relevant than contracts without completed deliveries id § mi offerors were encouraged to provide information on problems encountered on the past performance contracts and the corrective actions taken to resolve the problems id § lia the rfp stated that the agency’s evaluation of offerors’ relevant past performance would be based on the following elements in descending order of importance  overall customer satisfaction – would the customer select this firm again  cost control – delivered within budget provided current and accuratecomplete billings and relationship of negotiated costs to actuals  quality of product – compliance with contract requirements accuracy of reports technical excellence management responsiveness appropriateness of personnel and stood behind warranty  timeliness of performance – met interim milestones reliable completed on time including wrapup and contract administration id § mi evaluation of proposals the coast guard received proposals from eight offerors which were evaluated by separate past performance technical proposal and management proposal evaluation teams the evaluation teams assigned adjectival ratings under the evaluation factors for each proposal supported by a narrative that identified respective strengths weaknesses and deficiencies under each of the evaluation factors at the conclusion of this review the coast guard established a competitive range that included the proposals of bollinger eastern huntington ingalls bath iron works and vt halter marine the proposals of the three other offerors were excluded from the competitive range ar tab  competitive range determination at  discussions were conducted to advise the offerors of the weaknesses and deficiencies in their proposals as relevant here both eastern and bath iron works received strengths under the concept design factor specifically under the soundness of design subfactor the technical evaluation team found that both firms proposed a mature and feasible machinery plant control and monitoring system based on previous systems for naval vessels of similar complexity this was determined to provide a benefit to the government because the mature design increased confidence that the systems will meet requirements and have lower technical risk see ar tab  eastern initial technical evaluation encl  at  bath iron works initial technical evaluation encl  at  in contrast the technical evaluation team assigned vt halter marine a significant weakness under the design approach factor for the firm’s approach to machinery plant control and monitoring systems noting that vt halter marine demonstrated an inadequate understanding of the intended role of the system relative to the cisr system id vt halter marine initial technical evaluation encl  at  the coast guard also informed offerors of weaknesses in their respective past performance in this regard huntington ingalls vt halter marine and bath iron works were informed of marginal ratings in past performance and were requested to document any corrective action taken with regard to negative past performance offerors submitted draft final proposals and received feedback from the agency prior to submitting final proposal revisions fpr both eastern and bath iron works made changes to their ship design as relevant here in its draft final proposal eastern increased its ship’s length from deleted feet to deleted feet and increased its ship’s weight from deleted long tons lt to deleted lt see eg ar tab  eastern’s draft final proposal technical vol at   bath iron works increased the weight of its ship from deleted lt to deleted lt see ar tab  bath iron works initial proposal technical vol at  tab  bath iron works draft final proposal technical vol at  the coast guard analyzed the impact of these changes and concluded that they did not affect the offerors’ ability to meet the speed requirement co’s nd supp statement at  the coast guard evaluated fprs as follows   bollinger eastern bath iron works huntington ingalls vt halter marine concept design   soundness of design superior superior superior superior superior mission effectiveness superior superior superior superior superior design approach superior superior superior superior superior organizational management satisfactory satisfactory satisfactory satisfactory satisfactory production capability satisfactory satisfactory satisfactory satisfactory satisfactory past performance satisfactory superior satisfactory marginal marginal price      ar tab  source selection authority ssa briefing at  the technical evaluation team tet determined that the offerors had corrected all identified weaknesses or deficiencies and assigned all offerors superior ratings under the two concept design subfactors and under the design approach factor as relevant here the technical evaluation team found that vt halter marine’s fpr explained the functionality of its proposed system such that the firm no longer had a significant weakness under the design approach factor see ar tab  vt halter marine final technical evaluation at  with respect to past performance the agency’s past performance evaluation team ppet reviewed the past performance questionnaires for contracts identified by the offerors for recency and relevance the ppet also identified additional recent and relevant contracts through the past performance information retrieval system ppirs where the ppet found negative or questionable past performance information the ppet had telephone conversations with references we set forth below a summary of the past performance assessments of each of the competitive range offerors with respect to bollinger the ppet determined that the offeror had satisfactory past performance based upon three past performance questionnaires one of the questionnaires addressed the performance of bollinger’s design agent gibbs  cox on the littoral combat ship which the ppet found to be recent and relevant the prime contractor who completed the questionnaire rated gibbs  cox’s performance as marginal with respect to its “ability to manage an acceptable ratio of negotiated costs to actual costs” ar tab  bollinger past performance questionnaire littoral combat ship at  the ppet contacted the prime contractor who stated that the design agent did not meet some contractual requirements and that costs surged as additional government requirements were added to the contract the ppet also contacted the navy personnel responsible for the program those individuals stated that the contractual issues were not entirely the fault of the design agent because the construction of the ship was simultaneous with its design and a requirement to adhere to naval vessel rules was added during contract administration the ppet concluded based upon the navy’s opinion that the design agent’s marginal rating was mitigated by circumstances that were not the agent’s fault ar tab  bollinger initial past performance evaluation at  tab  bollinger final past performance evaluation at  two of bollinger’s questionnaires addressed the firm’s performance of contracts for the coast guard’s fast response cutter and the bee mar offshore supply vessel which the ppet also found to be recent and relevant the coast guard additionally reviewed ppirs reports for the fast response cutter with respect to the fast response cutter the most recent ppirs report included four marginal ratings in the areas of schedule management management responsiveness and logistic supportsustainment in this regard the ppirs report stated that the schedule for soft deliverables was unsatisfactory ar tab  bollinger ppirs report at  the more recent past performance questionnaire for the fast response cutter by the same individual that reported on ppirs rated bollinger’s performance as mostly exceptional to satisfactory with no marginal or unsatisfactory ratings although the questionnaire’s narrative indicated some areas of concern such as noncompliant “soft deliverables” it noted the firm’s substantial organizational and management change which had resulted in improved performance ar tab  bollinger past performance questionnaire fast response cutter at  the ppet concluded that bollinger “met previous contractual requirements with no marginal or unsatisfactory past performance reports” and stated that with respect to timeliness of performance bollinger had addressed its initial delivery problems and was on schedule due to improvements in bollinger’s management structure see ar tab  bollinger final past performance evaluation at  with respect to eastern the ppet determined that the offeror’s past performance was superior based upon five past performance questionnaires the ppet found no relevant ppirs reports two of the questionnaires addressed the performance of eastern’s design agent stx marine on the irish offshore patrol vessel and the new zealand offshore patrol vessel as relevant here the questionnaire for the irish offshore patrol vessel was completed by the prime contractor on the contract babcock international who provided positive evaluations ar tab  eastern’s past performance questionnaire irish offshore patrol vessel at  the questionnaire for the new zealand offshore patrol vessel was completed by the prime contractor’s engineering manager whose involvement with the program covered the period from june  to april  id new zealand offshore patrol vessel at  the remaining questionnaires addressed eastern’s performance on the aries marine platform supply vessel grand manan adventure ferry and the laborde marine supply vessel and contained positive evaluations all of the contracts were found to be recent and relevant and based on the past performance questionnaires the ppet assigned eastern a superior rating under past performance ar tab  eastern final past performance evaluation at  with respect to bath iron works the ppet determined that the offeror’s past performance was satisfactory the ppet found that three of bath iron works’ five past performance questionnaires were relevant one questionnaire addressed the performance of bath iron works’ design agent navantia sa on the spanish navy’s buque de acción maritima two questionnaires addressed the performance of bath iron works on the us navy’s ddg  arleighburke class guided missile and ddg  zumwalt class guided missile destroyers the ppet also identified ppirs reports for bath iron works’ contracts for two littoral combat ships lcs  and lcs  which were determined to be relevant the ppet initially assigned bath iron works a marginal rating largely based on its performance on the lcs  and lcs  contracts in this regard the ppet noted that with regard to customer satisfaction the navy customer rated bath iron works as marginal or worse on both the lcs  and lcs  contracts for management responsiveness cost control quality of product and schedule see ar tab  bath iron works initial past performance evaluation at  the ppet conducted followup telephone calls to obtain updated information on the littoral combat ship contracts and were informed that performance had improved since the navy stopped changing the requirements and that schedule issues continued to improve over time ar tab  bath iron works final past performance evaluation at   as relevant here the customer on the littoral combat ships lcs  and lcs  informed the ppet that bath iron works was meeting contract requirements and had learned how to weather problems caused by outside forcessuch as hurricane katrina and the us navy deciding to use the naval vessel rulesthat played a large part in bath iron works’ lateness and failure to meet schedule requirements earlier in the contract id at  on this basis the ppet determined that the past performance problems on the littoral combat ship contracts were not the fault of bath iron works with respect to huntington ingalls the ppet determined that the offeror’s past performance was marginal the ppet received past performance questionnaires for four contracts for the coast guard’s national security cutters and the us navy’s ddg  destroyer all were found to be recent and relevant and included mostly positive comments however the ppet noted that a ppirs report for the national security cutter no  contract indicated schedule problems ar tab  huntington ingalls final past performance evaluation at  the ppet also identified three ppirs reports for huntington ingalls’ contract for lpd class amphibious transport dock ships id at  the ppet found that the ppirs reports which covered performance from october  to september  included adjectival ratings that ranged from exceptional to unsatisfactory in this regard the ppet noted that although the customer that completed the ppirs report stated that it “probably would” again award a contract to huntington ingalls the ppirs report included numerous adverse comments for example the ppet noted huntington ingalls’ unsatisfactory rating for cost control under which the lpd customer commented that “cost performance    has degraded” over the performance period id at  the ppet’s followup conversations on the lpd contract indicated that negative performance was continuing in this regard the customer for the lpd contract noted that huntington ingalls’ work had deteriorated prior to hurricane katrina worsened after the hurricane and had improved to be “stabilized at a poor level” id at  on this basis the ppet concluded that huntington ingalls’ failure to meet contract requirements was the contractor’s fault id at  finally with respect to vt halter marine the ppet determined that the offeror’s past performance was marginal the ppet received past performance questionnaires for five contracts and identified an additional contract in ppirs three of the questionnaires addressed the performance of vt halter marine’s design agent dcns on the singapore navy formidable class frigate the french navy multimission class frigate and the french navy horizon class frigate and provided very positive comments on dcns’s performance see ar tab  vt halter marine initial past performance evaluation at  the remaining two questionnaires addressed the performance of vt halter marine on the egyptian navy fast missile craft and the us navy’s t‑ags  oceanographic survey ship the ppet also identified ppirs reports for the two vt halter marine contracts as well as reports for the us navy’s t‑agm  unarmed missile range instrumentation ship the ppet found the five contracts for which it received past performance questionnaires and the t‑agm  contract were recent and relevant in this regard the ppet concluded that the t‑agm  was relevant due to the similarity of work in both type and complexity as that required by the offshore patrol cutter and was comparable due to similar sizes speeds and draft requirements ar tab  vt halter marine final past performance evaluation at  encl  past performance relevancy worksheet offeror h the ppet noted the ppirs reports and questionnaires indicated problems under the egyptian navy and t‑agm  contracts with respect to vt halter marine’s performance in delivering a quality product in a timely fashion the ppet concluded that vt halter marine’s multiple instances of failing to meet contract requirements merited a marginal past performance rating see ar tab  vt halter marine final past performance evaluation at  source selection decision the evaluation results were provided to the agency’s ssa who weighed the comparative merits of the offers based upon the final evaluation reports ar tab  source selection decision at  in this regard the ssa identified strengths and differentiating characteristics of the offerors’ proposals under each of the evaluation factors with respect to the most important factor concept design the ssa concluded that all the competitive range offerors had strong technical concept designs and that no offeror stood out id at  the ssa recognized however that various offerors had strengths under the hierarchical requirements for example the ssa acknowledged that both eastern and vt halter marine received strengths for their proposed speeds of deleted and deleted knots respectively the ssa recognized however that all offerors proposed speeds that were above the threshold requirement and below the objective the ssa also noted as relevant here that huntington ingalls met the day patrol endurance objective but met only the lower boat threshold requirement and was the only offeror that failed to propose some form of electric propulsion for slow speed operations in this regard the ssa stated that the ability to use electric propulsion for extended periods of slow speed operations had significant advantages the ssa found no differentiation among offerors for helicopter hangar storage accommodation and pallet storage requirements id at  under the design approach factor the ssa concluded that all offerors provided a comprehensive design approach with few discriminators but noted that bollinger offered an approach that increased the government’s confidence of success and that eastern’s approach increased the likelihood that eastern would meet all requirements under the organizational management factor the ssa concluded that all offerors provided adequate descriptions of their organizational management and met the minimum requirements of the rfp but noted that the proposals of huntington ingalls and bath iron works were the only ones to receive strengths under this factor id at  ultimately the ssa concluded that past performance provided the basis upon which to differentiate these proposals in this regard the ssa stated that the evaluation of bollinger’s and eastern’s proposals indicated no adverse past performance information and therefore past performance was not raised in discussions with these firms in contrast the ssa noted that the initial evaluation of bath iron works huntington ingalls and vt halter marine identified adverse past performance information which was discussed with these firms with respect to bath iron works’ performance problems on the littoral combat ship program the ssa noted that bath had described its corrective actions that the customer confirmed that bath had made significant improvements and that some of the problems were not bath’s fault thus the ssa agreed with the ppet that bath iron works’ past performance was satisfactory with respect to huntington ingalls’ past performance problems the ssa noted that the customer provided updated information that indicated that huntington’s performance though improved remained at a poor level with respect to vt halter marine’s performance the ssa noted that the contractor had timeliness problems on the t‑ags  and tagm  ships and had not described in its fpr any changes or improvements that the firm had implemented to improve poor performance but rather had focused on changes it would implement if it received this contract the ssa agreed with the ppet that huntington ingalls’ and vt halter marine’s past performance should be assessed as marginal id at ‑ based upon his review the ssa concluded that although huntington ingalls’ and vt halter marine’s proposals met all technical and management requirements and offered some unique strengths the offerors’ recent and relevant past performance records did not provide confidence that they would be able to satisfactorily perform the contract id at  the ssa further concluded that huntington ingalls’ proposal included “essentially a threshold concept design” and otherwise had limited distinguishable benefits in comparison to other offerors the ssa also noted that considering the firm’s marginal past performance rating its proposal was the least advantageous to the government id at  with respect to vt halter marine’s proposal the ssa recognized that the offeror’s proposal had several technical strengths in concept design and met several hierarchical objectives but its marginal past performance offset any technical advantages id based on these conclusions the ssa selected the proposals of bollinger eastern and bath iron works for award after debriefings huntington ingalls and vt halter marine protested to our office discussion huntington ingalls and vt halter marine raise numerous challenges to the coast guard’s evaluation of proposals under the technical and past performance factors and to the selection decision the protesters also contend that eastern’s reliance on a subcontractor to provide a past performance questionnaire for eastern created a conflict of interest we have considered all of the protester’s arguments although we only address the primary ones and find that none provide a basis to sustain the protests bollinger’s past performance huntington ingalls and vt halter marine both challenge the coast guard’s evaluation of bollinger’s past performance arguing that the agency unreasonably assigned bollinger a satisfactory past performance rating despite receiving negative information about bollinger’s performance on the fast response cutter contract see huntington ingalls supp protest at  vt halter marine nd supp protest at  in this regard huntington ingalls contends that the coast guard unequally evaluated its and bollinger’s past performance specifically huntington ingalls contends that the coast guard ignored negative information with respect to bollinger’s performance of the fast response cutter contract while focusing on negative

servs inc b‑ b july    cpd ¶  at  a protester’s disagreement with the agency’s judgment concerning the merits of the protester’s past performance does not establish that the evaluation was unreasonable sam facility mgmt inc b july    cpd ¶  at  here the record shows that the coast guard’s evaluation of bollinger’s past performance on the fast response cutter was reasonable the ppet recognized that the most recent ppirs report included four marginal ratings in the areas of schedule management management responsiveness and logistic supportsustainment see ar tab  bollinger ppirs report at  the ppet also received however a more recent past performance questionnaire from the same individual the contracting officer that prepared the ppirs report for this cutter the questionnaire provided adjectival ratings that ranged from mostly exceptional to satisfactory there were no marginal or unsatisfactory ratings see ar tab  bollinger past performance questionnaire fast response cutter at  the questionnaire’s narrative comments indicated that bollinger had made “substantial changes” to its organization and to its management which resulted in improved performance for example with respect to “customer satisfaction” the contracting officer stated that the “new management structure is a breath of fresh air and is a very positive step in the right direction” and that bollinger “recently showed very good progress” id at  similarly with respect to timeliness of delivery the contracting officer stated that problems with deliveries had been resolved and that a “positive trend appears apparent with regard to delivering of fast response cutters with fewer discrepancies” id at  although the past performance questionnaire indicated some areas of concern such as timely submittal of “soft deliverables” the coast guard found that the narrative discussion of bollinger’s performance on the fast response cutter supported a satisfactory rating the agency states in this regard that the ppet noted that the more recent past performance questionnaire showed an increasing trend of improved performance for bollinger that justified a satisfactory rating supp co’s statement at  huntington ingalls and vt halter marine disagree with this judgment but this does not show that the agency’s evaluation was unreasonable we also do not find that the coast guard treated huntington ingalls and bollinger disparately where the ppet did not accept certain positive adjectival ratings with respect to huntington ingalls’ lpd contract with the navy the record shows that the ppet as it did with bollinger’s questionnaire looked below the adjectival ratings and considered the narrative information in the ppirs reports and information obtained directly from the lpd project manager although the ppet concluded that huntington ingalls’ performance had improved in some areas it remained poor overall in this regard the ppet noted a number of statements indicating dissatisfaction with performance on the lpd contract co’s statement at  citing ar tab  huntington ingalls final past performance evaluation at  in this regard the lpd project manager informed the ppet in a telephone conversation that huntington ingalls’ performance had “stabilized at a poor level” ar tab  huntington ingalls final past performance evaluation at  we find that the ppet’s marginal rating of huntington ingalls’ past performance did not reflect disparate treatment impact of hurricane katrina huntington ingalls also complains that the coast guard treated it and bath iron works unequally with respect to the impact of hurricane katrina on the offerors’ past performance that is huntington ingalls argues that the coast guard ignored the negative impact of hurricane katrina on its less than favorable performance while finding that the impact of hurricane katrina excused bath iron works’ poor performance huntington ingalls supp protest at  the coast guard explains that it followed up with various points of contact with respect to the contracts in question and found the impact of hurricane katrina on the performance of huntington ingalls and bath iron works was not similar huntington ingalls’ past performance references stated that the company’s poor performance on the lpd contract started well before hurricane katrina and continues to date “stabilized at a poor level” in contrast the navy references for bath iron works’ littoral combat ship contracts stated that bath’s poor performance was caused in part by hurricane katrina as well as the navy’s decision after contract award to adopt the naval vessel rules which provided new criteria and verification requirements for approving and certifying ships additionally the navy noted that bath iron works’ performance on the littoral combat ship contracts had improved and that contract requirements were being met supp co’s statement at  the record demonstrates that the coast guard’s consideration of the impact of hurricane katrina on the performance of huntington ingalls and bath iron works was reasonable while the protester focuses on the offerors’ fpr submissions to support its position that it adequately explained how hurricane katrina negatively impacted its performance see huntington ingalls supp comments at  offerors were put on notice that information independently gathered by the coast guard might be given greater weight than information provided in offerors’ proposals see rfp amend  § mid here the agency reasonably gave greater weight to information provided in the ppirs reports as well as followup conversations with the navy’s project manager contracting officer and contracting officer’s representative for the lpd program in determining how to assess fault for huntington’s poor performance under the program see ar tab  huntington ingalls final past performance evaluation at  in contrast the reviewing official for the littoral combat ship ppirs reports informed the coast guard that bath iron works’ performance problems were not primarily bath’s fault but were the result of hurricane katrina and the navy switching to the naval vessel rules after contract award the reviewing official also advised that bath iron works is now meeting its contract requirements see id bath iron works final past performance evaluation at  although huntington ingalls disagrees with the agency’s judgment in this regard it has not shown that the agency acted unreasonably eastern’s past performance vt halter marine also challenges the coast guard’s evaluation of eastern’s past performance arguing that the ppet improperly credited eastern for performance of the firm’s proposed design agent on the new zealand offshore patrol vessel because the reference was for performance outside the rfp’s year recency requirement july  through april  vt halter marine nd supp protest at  the coast guard responds that the rfp required past performance references for contracts that were performed during the past five years but did not limit the agency’s review of performance to within the year window supp ar at  we need not resolve this dispute about the coast guard’s interpretation of the rfp because the record does not show any reasonable possibility of prejudice with respect to the consideration of the design agent’s past performance on the new zealand offshore patrol vessel even if this performance is not considered eastern provided four other recent and relevant past performance questionnaires including another for its design agent’s performance on the irish offshore patrol vessel that showed superior past performance as a result we see nothing unreasonable about the superior rating for past performance assigned to eastern’s proposal vt halter marine’s past performance vt halter marine complains that the coast guard unreasonably considered its performance on the t‑agm  unarmed missile range instrumentation ship which the coast guard itself found in ppirs and for which the agency determined that vt halter marine had performance problems vt halter marine contends that this contract should not have been viewed as relevant to the work here because of differences in the ships’ dimensions performance propulsion electrical systems cisr and small boat recovery and launch requirements vt halter marine protest at  we agree the rfp informed offerors that the agency’s relevance determination would be based on various ship characteristics including dimensions performance propulsion electrical plant hullstructure materials and boat launchrecovery rfp amend  § lia in its protest vt halter marine provided detailed information describing how the tagm  and the offshore patrol cutter are very different in terms of size and complexity the coast guard did not respond to these arguments but instead relied upon conclusory statements in the evaluation record that the tagm  was comparable due to similar sizes speeds and draft requirements ar tab  vt halter marine final past performance evaluation at  encl  past performance relevancy worksheet offeror h in fact the information provided by vt halter marine indicates that the tagm  is much larger  feet in length and displacing  tons as compared to the proposed offshore patrol cutter’s deleted feet and deleted tons with a different propulsion system absent some explanation from the coast guard in response to the protest or otherwise in the record there is no basis to conclude that the tagm  contract is relevant nevertheless the record establishes that vt halter marine was not prejudiced by the agency’s consideration of its tagm  performance specifically the ppet also based its marginal past performance rating upon the firm’s poor performance of the egyptian navy fast missile craft contract see ar tab  vt halter marine final past performance evaluation at  the ppet found that the customer on this contract reported marginal performance with respect to among other things vt halter marine’s management of its design agent and its untimely contract performance id at  the customer also advised the ppet that although vt halter marine does a “great job” in production and construction it has problems with engineering and management that require more than the usual amount of oversight id at  on this record even if we conclude the coast guard should not have included a review of vt halter marine’s performance of the tagm  contract we see no basis to sustain this protest given the similar problems described in the firm’s performance of the contract for the egyptian navy conflict of interest vt halter marine and huntington ingalls also contend that the coast guard should not have considered eastern’s past performance questionnaire for the irish offshore patrol vessel contract arguing that it was tainted by a conflict of interest eastern proposed babcock international the company that completed the past performance questionnaire for the design agent’s performance on the irish offshore patrol vessel as a secondtier subcontractor the protesters argue that babcock’s evaluation of the design agent’s performance under the irish offshore patrol vehicle contract reflects an impermissible impaired objectivity conflict of interest vt halter marine nd supp protest at  huntington ingalls supp comments at  we find no merit to this argument as relevant here an impaired objectivity organizational conflict of interest arises where a firm’s ability to render impartial advice to the government would be undermined by the firm’s competing interests federal acquisition regulation far § ‑ aetna gov’t health plans inc foundation health fed servs inc b‑ et al july    cpd ¶  at  the concern in impaired objectivity situations including evaluation of products or services is that a firm’s ability to render impartial advice to the government will be undermined by its relationship to the product or service being evaluated purvis sys inc b‑ b aug    cpd ¶  at  unlike the situation here the situations described by the far and in our decisions relating to impaired objectivity involve cases where a firm’s work under one government contract could entail its evaluating itself either through an assessment of performance under another contract or an evaluation of proposals for example in aetna we concluded that the participation of an affiliate of the awardee’s proposed subcontractor in evaluating offerors’ proposals as a consultant to the agency presented an impaired objectivity organizational conflict of interest see aetna gov’t health plans inc foundation health fed servs inc supra at  here however babcock did not complete the past performance questionnaire as part of its performance of a government contract that is babcock was not under contract to the coast guard to evaluate proposals moreover to the extent that the protesters believe that allowing eastern to rely on babcock for past performance information resulted in the coast guard receiving biased information the protesters have not demonstrated that the information provided by babcock was inaccurate in this regard eastern’s design agent was involved in all of eastern’s past performance reference contracts all of which indicate the design agent’s positive past performance see ar tab  eastern’s fpr business vol past performance narratives at  tab  eastern past performance questionnaires without a showing that babcock provided inaccurate or misleading information we have no basis to conclude that the agency erred in its reliance on this information technical evaluation huntington ingalls and vt halter marine challenge various aspects of the coast guard’s evaluation of technical proposals for example both protesters argue that the coast guard failed to consider the effect of increases in vessel length and weight in eastern’s fpr on the vessel’s speed in this regard the protesters contend that the analysis produced by the coast guard was based on eastern’s draft final proposal and did not reflect changes in weight that appeared in eastern’s fpr huntington ingalls nd supp comments at  vt halter marine nd supp comments at  we agree with the protesters that the analysis provided by the coast guard in response to the protests does not appear to be based on the information provided in eastern’s fpr however huntington ingalls and vt halter marine have not demonstrated that eastern’s fpr design would have failed to meet the solicitation’s speed requirement or proven that the calculations provided in eastern’s fpr are in error as such their arguments do not provide a basis for sustaining the protests vt halter marine also protests the evaluation of its proposal under the technical design factor arguing that the navy unreasonably credited eastern’s and bath iron works’ proposals with a strength for their machinery plant control and monitoring systems without similarly crediting a strength to vt halter marine’s proposal for the same feature more specifically vt halter marine argues that similar to eastern and bath iron works it proposed an advanced machinery plant control and monitoring system that would consist of deleted vt halter marine nd supp protest at  in reviewing protests against allegedly improper evaluations our office examines the record to determine whether the agency’s judgment was reasonable in accord with the evaluation factors set forth in the rfp and whether the agency treated offerors equally in its evaluation of their respective proposals and did not disparately evaluate proposals with respect to the same requirements iap world servs inc emcor gov’t servs b et al july    cpd ¶  at  the record shows that the coast guard did not evaluate the proposals of vt halter marine eastern and bath iron works disparately with respect to the firms’ proposed machinery plant control and monitoring systems the tet found that eastern and bath iron works proposed designs that were based on previous systems for naval vessels of similar complexity and that were more mature than what was expected of a concept design the tet concluded that this would benefit the government because it increased confidence that the machinery plant control and monitoring system would meet requirements and would present lower technical risk see ar tab  eastern tet consensus report encl  at  bath iron works tet consensus report encl  at  in contrast vt halter marine’s initial explanation of its proposed machinery plant control and monitoring system was viewed as a significant weakness see ar tab  vt halter marine initial technical evaluation at  after discussions the tet concluded that vt halter marine had resolved the evaluators’ concerns and that the firm’s proposed machinery plant control and monitoring system was acceptable although vt halter marine argues that its proposed system should have been assigned a strength and that its design is advanced vt halter marine has not explained or demonstrated how its system is advanced or that it is similarly based on a mature design in short vt halter marine had not shown that the agency’s judgment was unreasonable or in error selection decision finally huntington ingalls and vt halter marine challenge the ssa’s selection decision asserting that it was flawed because the decision was based on evaluations that the protesters allege were unreasonable as discussed above we found no merit to the protesters’ challenges to the agency’s technical and past performance evaluations thus there is no basis to question the ssa’s ultimate selection decision

arcus properties llc b mar    cpd ¶  at   huntington ingalls also argues that the coast guard should have given it more credit for the positive past performance information the firm received on the

relevant only that its poor performance under this contract should be discounted given its more favorable performance ratings under the national security cutter contract even were we to accept huntington ingalls’ argument that the rfp provided that performance under a more relevant contract should receive greater weight this does not mean as the protester apparently believes that the agency

performance references were relevant huntington ingalls initially challenged the relevance of eastern’s past performance but abandoned its arguments following the receipt of the agency’s report the record supports the reasonableness of the coast guard’s explanations with respect to the ppet’s determination that eastern’s past performance was relevant although vt halter marine disagrees it has not shown that the agency abused its broad discretion with respect to determining relevancy  vt halter marine complains that the coast guard considered a ppirs report for the egyptian navy fast missile craft that reflected performance outside the rfp’s year recency requirement vt halter marine st supp protest at  although this particular ppirs report is not within the rfp’s recency requirement the record shows that the ppet considered a number of other ppirs reports and questionnaires for the egyptian contract showing unsatisfactory and marginal performance that fell within the
