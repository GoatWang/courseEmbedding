johnson  johnson has a baby powder problem johnson  johnson has a baby powder problem more than  women are suing the company for covering up a cancer risk by susan berfield jef feeley and margaret cronin fisk  march   photograph by travis rathbone from jacqueline fox worked in restaurant kitchens and school cafeterias cleaned people’s houses watched their kids raised a son and took in two foster children she was careful about her appearance and liked to tend the garden in front of her home in birmingham alabama she had been treated for high blood pressure arthritis and diabetes but at  she was feeling pretty good in the spring of  her poodle dexter began acting strangely he’d jump on her he’d cry he’d stay close by all day fox happened to watch a television program about a dog that sensed its owner was unwell when she let dexter sniff her he whined even more a week later fox was diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer she had chemotherapy to shrink the tumors and surgery to remove her uterus ovaries fallopian tubes and part of her spleen and colon in december of that year she saw a commercial from an alabama law firm beasley allen suggesting a connection between longterm use of johnson  johnson’s baby powder and ovarian cancer fox had been sprinkling baby powder made from talc on her underwear every day since she was a teen “i was raised up on it” she later said in a deposition “they was to help you stay fresh and clean … we ladies have to take care of ourselves” it was as normal as using toothpaste or deodorant “we both were a bit skeptical at first” says her son marvin salter a mortgage banker in jacksonville fla “it has to be safe it’s put on babies it’s been around forever why haven’t we heard about any ill effects” fox and salter in june  source fox family fox died from the cancer in october  four months later a jury in st louis concluded that talcum powder contributed to the development of the disease and that johnson  johnson was liable for negligence conspiracy and failure to warn women of the potential risk of using baby powder in the genital area the verdict decided by a  vote included  million in compensatory damages and  million in punitive damages more than fox’s lawyers had recommended salter bowed his head and wept “people were using something they thought was perfectly safe” he says “and it isn’t at least give people the choice jj didn’t give people a choice” among the most painful revelations he says was that in the s even as the company acknowledged concerns in the health community it considered increasing its marketing efforts to black and hispanic women who were already buying the product in high numbers fox was black the jury foreman krista smith says internal documents provided the most incriminating evidence “it was really clear they were hiding something” she wanted to award the fox family even more imerys talc america the biggest talc supplier in the country and the sole source of the powder for jj was also named as a defendant the company wasn’t found liable “jury verdicts should not be confused with regulatory rulings or rigorous scientific findings” carol goodrich a spokeswoman for johnson  johnson consumer said in an email “the overwhelming body of scientific research and clinical evidence supports the safety of cosmetic talc” the company says it will appeal the verdict in a statement imerys said it’s “confident that its products are safe for use by its customers our confidence is supported by the consensus view of qualified scientific experts and regulatory agencies” johnson  johnson has spent more than  billion to resolve legal claims over its drugs and medical devices since  that year it agreed to pay  billion to settle criminal and civil probes into claims that it illegally marketed risperdal an antipsychotic drug to children and the elderly two other medicines were included in the settlement it was one of the largest health fraud penalties in us history the company has also agreed to pay some  billion to resolve lawsuits about its artificial hips and  million for faulty vaginalmesh inserts in its  annual report jj stated that more than 7 people had filed product liability claims and that didn’t include the talc powder cases more than  women and their families are suing jj and imerys claiming the companies have known of the association with ovarian cancer for years and failed to warn them the next trial is scheduled to begin on april  in a st louis circuit court “whether or not the science indicates that baby powder is a cause of ovarian cancer johnson  johnson has a very significant breach of trust” says julie hennessy a marketing professor at northwestern’s kellogg school of management “in trying to protect this one business they’ve put the whole jj brand at risk” “it has to be safe it’s put on babies it’s been around forever why haven’t we heard about any ill effects” talc is the softest mineral on earth able to absorb odors and moisture it’s composed of magnesium silicon and oxygen and is mined usually from deposits above ground in more than a dozen countries it’s used in eye shadow and blush and chewing gum but mostly it’s used in ceramics paint paper plastic and rubber china is the biggest source johnson  johnson’s supply comes from the southern province of guangxi johnson  johnson began selling baby powder more than  years ago soon after the company was founded in new brunswick nj among its first products were adhesives infused with pain relievers such as mustard seed capsicum quinine and opium when customers complained that removing the plasters left them with skin irritation jj’s scientific director sent them small containers of talc to help soothe any rashes a few reported that the talc also seemed to ease diaper rash in  the company introduced baby powder made of  percent talc and sold in a metal tin labeled “for toilet and nursery” the other  percent is a mix of fragrant oils smell is evocative and this particular scent is mingled with powerful memories—a marketer’s dream “it’s calming nurturing … it doesn’t grab your senses it wafts” fred tewell a jj executive told the associated press in  the company has said that in blind tests the scent of baby powder is recognized more often than that of chocolate coconut or mothballs from the early s jj tried to persuade women to use the powder on themselves too ads in  included the tag line “best for baby best for you” by  when fox was  years old ads featured a sultry woman sprinkling talc on her bare shoulder no baby is in sight “want to feel cool smooth and dry it’s as easy as taking powder from a baby” two decades later the company told the new york times magazine that 7 percent of its baby powder was used by adults sales of jj’s talcum powder products came to about  million in  according to euromonitor that’s not essential to a 7 billion company that makes most of its money selling medical devices and drugs but without baby powder jj may not have developed baby oil or baby shampoo nor have a baby division worth some  billion baby powder’s value to the company extends well beyond sales fortyfive years ago british researchers analyzed  ovarian tumors and found talc particles “deeply embedded” in  the study published in 7 was the first to raise the possibility that talcum powder could pose a risk in  a study in the journal cancer by daniel cramer an epidemiologist at brigham  women’s hospital in boston showed the first statistical link between genital talc use and ovarian cancer soon after cramer received a call from bruce semple an executive at jj the two met in boston “dr semple spent his time trying to convince me that talc use was a harmless habit while i spent my time trying to persuade him to consider the possibility that my study could be correct and that women should be advised of this potential risk of talc” cramer a paid expert and witness for the plaintiffs said in a  court filing “i don’t think this was a question of money” he says now “i think it was pride of ownership baby powder is a signature product for jj” baby powder is considered a cosmetic which doesn’t need to be approved by the food and drug administration under the  food drug and cosmetic act the law is laid out in a page document only two pages are devoted to the safety of cosmetics congress is considering updating the law to give the fda more authority to regulate products “it shouldn’t be up to consumer groups or jurors to try to make decisions about toxic products” says stacy malkan cofounder of the campaign for safe cosmetics jj and many other big companies support the changes jj does have a warning on baby powder cautioning against inhalation and the label notes that the powder is for external use only under pressure from consumers activists and impending california safety regulations jj has removed triclosan formaldehyde and other socalled chemicals of concern from its baby products in the past few years in  samantha lucas a company spokeswoman explained the shift to scientific american “we’ve been replying with evidence of the science that ensures safety now we have to go beyond science and be responsive to our consumers because it’s really about their peace of mind” if jj applies this same thinking to baby powder it has an alternative it already sells baby powder made from cornstarch for about the same price no study shows that cornstarch poses any potential risks the american cancer society has been suggesting since  that women consider it if they want to use genital powder some of jj’s competitors including gold bond california baby and burt’s bees sell baby powder made of cornstarch only since cramer’s article was published an additional  epidemiological studies have found that longterm perineal talc use increases the risk of ovarian cancer by about  percent yet other research has found no association these mixed results have been cited by many agencies and institutions—with the exception of the international agency for research on cancer iarc at the world health organization—when they’ve looked at a potential link roberta ness former dean of the university of texas school of public health and former president of the american epidemiological society testified at the fox trial as an expert witness for the family she argued that several of the studies showing no link didn’t properly measure women’s exposure to talcum powder some asked women how many years they had used the powder others asked how often they used it only five measured both “what’s confused everyone in the past” she said during the trial is that “all these studies they looked at just frequency or just duration and they’re all over the map” she went on to explain that “all of the studies that have actually measured frequency and duration … have all shown a statistically significant trend toward more exposure causing more disease” ness pointed out that the association between hormone therapy and breast cancer is statistically smaller than the reported association between talc and ovarian cancer yet hormone therapy is considered to be a real risk she also said that not being able to prove how talc powder could contribute to cancer doesn’t relieve a company of the responsibility to warn women of the association “we now have data that suggest there’s an association between the zika virus and microcephaly” she said and even though scientists don’t know how the virus causes the disease “people aren’t waiting … people are out there saying ‘oh my gosh be aware this is trouble’ ” jj and imerys the talc supplier argue that the statistical associations between use of the powder and ovarian cancer are limited weak and based on unreliable data they say a causal link isn’t biologically plausible because there’s no proof that talc particles can move up through the reproductive tract or that once there they could cause cancer and if there’s no causal connection they say there’s no reason to add a warning to baby powder “there are statistical correlations you can always calculate correlations” says joshua muscat a professor of public health sciences at penn state college of medicine who serves as an expert consultant to jj “there hasn’t been a single scientific body that has considered talc to be a causal agent many don’t even consider talc to be a risk factor to me the science is black and white” the odds of a woman in the us falling ill with ovarian cancer are  in 7 talc use is associated with worse odds  in  according to those epidemiological studies the risks seem to be higher for invasive serous cancer which fox had ovarian cancer is among the most deadly cancers some  women are diagnosed each year often after the disease has spread the symptoms are easily dismissed as menstrual or abdominal discomfort there’s no regular screening for ovarian cancer no known causes only risk factors and some research suggests the malignancy may begin outside the ovaries at the end of the fallopian tubes more than  women die from the disease every year at the fox trial ness did some harsh math for the jury she claimed that baby powder use could contribute to some  women being diagnosed with ovarian cancer every year and  dying the defense counsel with great skepticism called that figure “astonishing” ness also noted that although black women generally have lower odds than white women of getting ovarian cancer a small study recently showed they’re more at risk of developing ovarian cancer when exposed to talc in the last months of her life fox answered questions from attorneys on both sides of the case the audio of her deposition was played in the courtroom near the end of the threeweek trial when asked why she was suing jj she said “to put out there that we as women got to take care of ourselves this is a disease i didn’t ask for but who am i i just want to do right” the science may be limited and it may be ambiguous many of the researchers involved including cramer say more study is necessary but the science wasn’t on trial in st louis johnson  johnson was “you don’t win with jurors on science they don’t understand science statistics the design of studies” says erik gordon a professor at the school of business and school of law at the university of michigan “they do understand there was some evidence of a connection between talc and cancer and jj didn’t tell customers about it” jj ads from  and  ebony magazone ad gaslight ad archives lawyers for fox introduced documents from  through  that however selective they may be portray a company struggling to revive interest in a symbolically important product with no proven health benefits and some suspected health risks a  memo outlining “major opportunities and major obstacles” acknowledged that “negative publicity from the health community on talc inhalation dust negative doctor endorsement cancer linkage continues” the same memo included a recommendation to “investigate ethnic africanamerican hispanic opportunities to grow the franchise” noting that these women accounted for a high proportion of sales an added handwritten note says the company planned a print advertising campaign goodrich the jj spokeswoman said in her email that this was “simply part of the company’s efforts to appropriately understand who is using its products” more than a decade later a task force devoted to improving sales of shower to shower a mix of talc and cornstarch marketed to women concluded “african american consumers in particular will be a good target with more of an emotional feeling and talk about reunions among friends etc team up with ebony magazine” it suggested promotions in churches beauty salons and barbershops and patti labelle or aretha franklin as celebrity endorsers neither became a spokeswoman for the brand it’s not clear how much of the rest of the plan was put into action since the company had already been advertising to blacks it’s standard practice for companies to focus on their most committed customers airlines take care of business fliers loyal shoppers get special deals at stores “that’s probably what they were doing” says hennessy the kellogg marketing professor “in today’s climate though that looks horrible from the outside it looks like jj is less concerned not more concerned about its most loyal users because of their ethnic origin” baby powder is a legacy brand in the black community “some people might say ‘what’s wrong with companies recognizing women of color as important consumers’ ” says robin means coleman a professor of communications studies and afroamerican studies at the university of michigan “we do want that but we do not want companies to market potentially carcinogenic products” salter fox’s son hadn’t been aware of the marketing documents until the trial “when i heard about it i was infuriated” he says “and so was the jury” in the s a toxicologist named alfred wehner worked as an outside consultant for jj his official role was to help evaluate the research on ovarian cancer and talc and advise the company on its response unofficially he was its scold wehner was on jj’s side but he was concerned that a cosmetics trade group partly funded by the company was mischaracterizing the scientific case for talc “a true friend is not he who beguiles you with flattery but he who discloses to you your mistakes before your enemies discover them” wehner began a 7 letter to michael chudkowski jj’s manager of preclinical toxicology wehner described statements on talc research from the group as inept misleading and outright false referring to a statement a few years earlier he wrote “at that time there had been about  studies more by now published in the open literature that did show a statistically significant association between hygienic talc use and ovarian cancer anybody who denies this risks that the talc industry will be perceived by the public like it perceives the cigarette industry denying the obvious in the face of all evidence to the contrary” he wanted the trade group to argue that the studies’ biological significance was questionable cosmetic talc isn’t a big part of imerys’s business the company formerly called luzenac primarily sells the mineral for industrial purposes but until  it also fought any suggestion that talc could be a potential carcinogen in the late s according to a luzenac memo introduced at the trial executives visited the head of epidemiology at the university of california at irvine for advice on how “to stop the rumor about ovarian cancer” one suggestion get “two or three experts from the club” to make the scientific case “the club” could refer to independent scientists luzenac had worked with before but fox’s lawyers argued for a more sinister interpretation—that these were scientists who would respond to industry pressure they also suggested that luzenac and jj exerted influence over a government group in  scientists with the national toxicology program part of the us department of health and human services voted  to list talc used perineally as a possible human carcinogen according to fox’s lawyers but the companies persuaded the ntp to defer an official decision on the status of talc a luzenac executive richard zazenski wrote to a colleague afterward “we the talc industry dodged a bullet in december based entirely over the confusion of the definition issue” he was referring to ambiguity over the composition of the talc studied because until the early 7s some powder contained naturally occurring asbestos fibers he also discussed a coming ntp review saying “time to come up with more confusion” imerys declined to comment on the specifics of the trial but one witness for the defense offered the possibility that zazenski was joking goodrich the jj spokeswoman said any suggestion by fox’s lawyers of improper influence is “merely an unsubstantiated allegation” in  the iarc the who cancer agency declared that perineal use of cosmeticgrade talc was possibly carcinogenic it cited “a modest but unusually consistent excess in risk” and also noted that bias in the studies couldn’t be ruled out publicly luzenac and jj tried to diminish the significance of the designation red meat and coffee are also included in this group of possible carcinogens before the year ended however luzenac stopped backing studies to prove talc’s safety because the “horse has already left the barn” wrote one executive noting that cosmetic companies had also cut funding one of their primary arguments for doing so he said was that there were already too many studies showing an association with ovarian cancer “to stem the tide of negative sentiment” more important luzenac added a warning on the safety data sheet included with the pound bags of talc it delivers to jj perineal use of the powder is a possible risk factor for ovarian cancer “we the talc industry dodged a bullet in december  time to come up with more confusion” johnson  johnson says it will continue to defend the safety of talc and it does so on its website there in a section explaining its policies about ingredients the company addresses concerns over formaldehyde parabens phthalates and triclosan—chemicals with damaged reputations and worse in every case jj states that the chemicals haven’t been proven harmful or that they were used in small enough amounts to be safe but the company decided to remove them from its products anyway “we understand that from your perspective government regulations may not be your only consideration when it comes to the personalcare products you and your family use” it says about parabens for phthalates the company says it recognizes that “the best way to keep your confidence was not to use it at all” why not apply that same standard to talc goodrich said the company listens when consumers raise concerns about ingredients but “few ingredients have the same demonstrated performance mildness and safety profile as cosmetic talc” the first woman to sue johnson  johnson for not warning of the risks of talcum powder was deane berg who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 7 she says she turned down a  million outofcourt settlement because she didn’t want to sign a confidentiality clause her case went to trial in  in a south dakota federal court as she was in remission the jury found jj was negligent but didn’t award berg any damages after the fox verdict 7 people contacted her attorneys at beasley allen the firm is looking into  of those in addition to  potential claims it was already investigating its next case will be tried in the same st louis circuit court as fox’s which has a reputation for being sympathetic to plaintiffs gloria ristesund’s trial is set for april she used baby powder for  years and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in  among those waiting their turn is tenesha farrar who was diagnosed with stage  ovarian cancer in  and is represented by the lanier law firm farrar who’s  and black says she’d used baby powder and shower to shower which jj sold to valeant in  for the last two decades “my grandmother and mother used it and i learned from them” she says after hearing about the jj marketing document she began crying “i can’t believe they singled us out” farrar had chemotherapy and a full hysterectomy she had to take off five months from her work as a clerk in a dialysis clinic outside st louis she lost her health insurance because she exceeded the policy limits and had to skip her last chemo treatment she and her husband eventually filed for bankruptcy she’s back at work now “i have five children who depend on me” she says “i will never use another jj
