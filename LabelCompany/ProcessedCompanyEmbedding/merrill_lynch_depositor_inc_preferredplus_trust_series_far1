the underlying securities issuer has filed electronically with the sec although we have no reason to believe the information concerning the underlying securities or the underlying securities issuer contained in the underlying securities issuers exchange act reports is not reliable neither the depositor nor the trustee participated in the preparation of such documents or made any due diligence inquiry with respect to the information provided therein no investigation with respect to the underlying securities issuer including without limitation no investigation as to its financial condition or creditworthiness or of the underlying securities has been made you should obtain and evaluate the same information concerning the underlying securities issuer as you would obtain and evaluate if your investment were directly in the underlying securities or in other securities issued by the underlying securities issuer there can be no assurance that events affecting the underlying securities or the underlying securities issuer have not occurred or have not yet been publicly disclosed which would affect the accuracy or completeness of the publicly available documents described above  item a risk factors your investment in the trust certificates will involve certain risks you should carefully consider the following discussion of risks and the other information included or incorporated by reference in the applicable prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus you should also carefully consider any risk factors and other information that the underlying securities issuer may file in its exchange act reports as referenced in item  above if the underlying securities are redeemed prior to their maturity date or if any call warrants are exercised you may not be able to reinvest your redemption or call proceeds at a yield comparable to the yield you would have received on your trust certificates the yield you will realize on your trust certificates depends upon several factors including      the purchase price of the trust certificates        when you acquire your trust certificates        whether the underlying securities issuer exercises its option to redeem the underlying securities and        whether the call warrant holders exercise their optional rights to purchase outstanding trust certificates the underlying securities issuer has the right to redeem the underlying securities at its option because the underlying securities issuer has the right to redeem the underlying securities early we cannot assure you that the trust will be able to hold the underlying securities until their maturity date although the call warrant holders are not obligated to exercise the call warrants the yield you will realize on your trust certificates depends on whether the call warrant holders exercise their call warrants to purchase the trust certificates prevailing interest rates at the time of an early redemption or a call exercise may be lower than the yield on your trust certificates therefore you may be unable to realize a comparable yield upon reinvesting the funds you receive from an early redemption or exercise of any call warrants in addition if the prevailing market value of the trust certificates exceeds the redemption price or call exercise price paid to you upon a redemption of the underlying securities or the exercise of a call you will not be able to realize such excess as well though holders of trust certificates are entitled to receive a distribution of a proportionate amount of the principal amount of the underlying securities on december   if that amount exceeds the call exercise price then the call warrant holders are likely to exercise their optional purchase rights if they do exercise those rights you will receive the call exercise price not a proportional amount of the principal amount on the underlying securities  you may not be paid if the assets of the trust are insufficient currently the trust has no significant assets other than the underlying securities if the underlying securities are insufficient to make payments or distributions on the trust certificates no other assets will be available for payment of the deficiency as a holding company the underlying securities issuers assets consist primarily of equity in its subsidiaries as a result the ability of the underlying securities issuer to make payments on the underlying securities depends upon its receipt of dividends loan payments and other funds from its subsidiaries in addition if any of the underlying securities issuers subsidiaries becomes insolvent the direct creditors of that subsidiary will have a prior claim on its assets and the rights of the underlying securities issuer and the rights of the underlying securities issuers creditors including the trusts rights as a holder of the underlying securities will be subject to that prior claim unless the underlying securities issuer is also a direct creditor of that subsidiary in addition various statutes and regulations restrict some of the underlying securities issuers subsidiaries from paying dividends or making loans or advances to the underlying securities issuer these restrictions could prevent those subsidiaries from paying the cash to the underlying securities issuer that the underlying securities issuer may need in order to pay the trust you may not recover the whole of the stated amount of your trust certificates if the trust disposes of the underlying securities on a default by the underlying securities issuer or in the event the underlying securities issuer ceases filing exchange act reports if the underlying securities issuer defaults on its obligations under the underlying securities or the underlying securities issuer ceases to file exchange act reports then the trust will either distribute the underlying securities to the trust certificateholders or dispose of them and distribute the proceeds to the trust certificateholders your recovery in either of those events may be limited by two factors      if a default occurs the market value of the underlying securities may be adversely affected and the proceeds of their disposition may be lower than the aggregate stated amount of the trust certificates and         the funds or aggregate principal amount of underlying securities you receive on that distribution may be less than the stated amount of your trust certificates the trustee will not manage the underlying securities except as described below the trust will not dispose of any underlying securities even if an event occurs that adversely affects the value of the underlying securities or that adversely affects the underlying securities issuer as provided in the applicable trust agreement the trust will dispose of the underlying securities only if      there is a payment default on any underlying securities        there is another type of default that accelerates the maturity of the underlying securities or        the underlying securities issuer ceases to file exchange act reports under the first circumstance listed above the trustee must sell the underlying securities on behalf of the trust even if adverse market conditions exist the trustee has no discretion to do otherwise if adverse market conditions do exist at the time of the trustees sale of the underlying securities you may incur greater losses than if the trust continued to hold the underlying securities the trust certificates are subject to the creditworthiness of the underlying securities issuer the trust certificates represent interests in obligations of the underlying securities issuer in particular the trust certificates will be subject to all the risks associated with directly investing in the underlying securities issuers unsecured subordinated debt obligations neither the underlying indenture nor the underlying securities place a limitation on the amount of indebtedness that may be incurred by the underlying securities issuer the payments owed to the trust certificateholders are unsecured obligations in a liquidation holders of the underlying securities including the trust will be paid only after holders of secured obligations of the underlying securities issuer according to the underlying securities prospectus the underlying securities are unsecured and will rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated debt of the underlying securities issuer however the underlying indenture provides that subject to certain exceptions the underlying securities issuer will not create assume incur or suffer to exist any lien with certain exceptions on the capital stock of any restricted subsidiary now owned by or acquired by it unless the underlying securities issuer shall cause the underlying securities to be secured equally and ratably with or at the underlying securities issuers option prior to any indebtedness secured thereby  the ratings of the trust certificates may change at the time of issuance moodys andor sp assigned ratings to the trust certificates equivalent to the ratings of the underlying securities as of the date of the applicable prospectus supplement any rating issued with respect to the trust certificates is not a recommendation to purchase sell or hold a security ratings do not comment on the market price of the trust certificates or their suitability for a particular investor we cannot assure you that these ratings will remain for any given period of time or that a ratings agency would not revise or withdraw entirely the ratings if in its judgment circumstances including without limitation the rating of the underlying securities merit a revision or withdrawal of a rating may adversely affect the market
