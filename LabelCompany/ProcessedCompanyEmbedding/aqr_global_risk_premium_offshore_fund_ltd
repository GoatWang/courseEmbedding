trust fact sheet overview investment objective the aqr global risk premium trust “the fund” is a globally diversified and risk balanced portfolio containing exposure to asset classes such as equities government bonds commodities and inflationlinked securities a distinguishing feature of aqr’s investment approach is to manage the fund’s exposure to asset classes and individual markets by their contribution to portfolio risk rather than by allocating capital to each asset class as is done in the more traditional approach to portfolio construction through the use of modest levels of leverage obtained through the use of derivative contracts and a highly disciplined risk management framework the fund seeks to achieve an attractive riskadjusted return while maintaining a stable risk profile through the market cycle the universe of investments for the fund may change under varying conditions and as the instruments evolve over time investment approach the fund invests in a globally diversified portfolio of over  markets across the following assets equity risk largecap developed equity emerging market equity us midcap equity us smallcap equity nominal interest rate risk developed

strategies reflect our basic investment philosophy that is we identify potential sources of return through our applied research efforts which combine economic theory and intuition and are informed by decades of data across geographies and asset groups alternative investment strategies we have identified alternative investing strategies that have the potential to increase an overall portfolio’s expected return decrease its risk and make it more resilient to different economic environments with diligent care we believe these alternative strategies can be an effective complement to traditional asset classes  absolute return event driven seeks to capture mispricing between highly related securities as when a company’s shares trade on different exchanges at different prices or a convertible bond trades for less than the value of its components fixed income seeks to capture relative value views across issuers industries countries and ratings macro investing seeks to benefit from mispricings and dislocations in stock bond currency and commodity markets by going long assets that the data suggest are undervalued and short those that are overvalued managed futures focuses on capturing trends in global stock bond currency and commodity markets multistrategy offers a diversified approach to alternatives investing seeking to provide broad exposure to several different strategies — such as arbitrage stock selection and macro — at the same time real return investing involves actively managing a diversified portfolio of liquid inflationsensitive assets designed with the objective to benefit from increases in inflation stock selection seeks to profit from market inefficiencies in individual stocks as when a stock’s price appears higher or lower than the company’s intrinsic value indicates it should be style premia seeks to harvest the return premia from value momentum carry and defensive themes across asset classes and geographies total return longshort equity involves buying stocks we expect to do well and short selling those we expect to do poorly seeking to provide investors equitylike returns with less volatility risk parity is a strategy that diversifies across global liquid asset classes by risk seeking to build a portfolio that is not reliant on any single asset class for longterm performance traditional investment strategies our traditional strategies seek to take full advantage of sources of returns that have generated longterm outperformance in the past and based on our rigorous evaluation are expected to continue to do so in the future equities defensive equity seeks to build a lowerrisk portfolio by overweighting stocks that exhibit higher quality and are less volatile relative to an index and underweighting lower quality morevolatile stocks diversified equities strategies employ alpha signals from our absolute return strategies and seek to beat equity benchmarks international funds also consider the performance of each country and currency momentum strategies seek to profit from the tendency of outperforming stocks to continue to outperform a phenomenon that has been studied extensively and shown to be pervasive across markets and asset classes multistyle strategies seek to outperform a benchmark such as the russell  by focusing on stocks that are deemed attractive on the basis of factors such as valuation momentum and profitability taxadvantaged investing aqr’s tax advantaged solutions aim to improve the aftertax riskadjusted returns available to qualified investors globally taxadvantaged

and indirect impacts on corporate profitability longterm portfolio performance and risk with this in mind our primary objective for considering esg issues is to improve the financial characteristics of our clients’ investments aqr’s esg framework is built on an economic model that considers esg issues as externalities imposed on society that are not fully priced into the value of the company or related security the mispricing of these externalities has the potential to encourage inappropriate corporate decisions  some of which may present investment risks while others may lead to potential profit opportunities research and empiricism are at the core of aqr and we believe in applying an objective research process to evaluate the merits and efficacy of all investment strategies including esg criteria we look for investment criteria or signals that are firmly grounded in economic theory and lead to measurable improvements in riskadjusted returns we recognize that investors may have other motivations for esg investing including upholding value or ethical standards andor promoting esg accountability of companies to benefit society as a whole aqr believes it can best address these preferences in clientspecific mandates that are customized for each investor’s unique preferences and circumstances in applying our esg philosophy aqr has adopted the following guiding principles aqr will embrace research and education on esg criteria in pursuit of continuous improvement to our understanding of the risk and opportunities to our clients our investment strategies and our business
