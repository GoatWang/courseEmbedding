facebook linkedin twitter email print theranos ceo elizabeth holmes at the glamour women of the year awards where she received an award in new york city thomson reuters a hedge fund that invested  million in theranos is suing the bloodtesting company the wall street journal reports partner fund management lp invested in theranos back in  the firm among other investors that collectively funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into theranos largely remained silent as the startup withered under increasing scrutiny during the past year the journal said through a series of lies material misstatements and omissions the defendants engaged in securities fraud and other violations by fraudulently inducing pfm to invest and maintain its investment in the company the company said in a letter to investors that the journal reviewed the suit comes less than a week after theranos stopped all of its clinical operations cutting  positions and closing its wellness centers where blood tests were performed instead theranos will focus solely on its technology namely the minilab platform it introduced in august at a scientific conference the product reveal didnt go over too well because those in attendance were hoping for large amounts of independently reviewed data that validated the companys bloodtest results we are fortunate to have supporters and investors who believe deeply in our mission of affordable less invasive lab testing and to have the runway to realize our vision theranos ceo elizabeth holmes said in an open letter published wednesday theranos until wednesday was trying to own all the parts of the bloodtesting industry by building the technology as well as administering the tests to patients the companys business model was based on offering more than  simple blood tests at a cost much lower than at traditional blood labs in addition to developing its own technology to test that blood which holmes had emphasized would need to be drawn in only very small amounts in the past year however theranos aspirations to be a onestop shop have been derailed with the company having to void two years worth of tests the government agency that regulates clinical labs found that theranos northern california lab posed immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety a theranos technician performing the companys fingerprick test on techcrunchs jon shieber at techcrunch disrupt sf  youtubetechcrunch the firm alleges according to the journal that theranos said it could do more forms of its fingerprick blood tests than it actually could that the company overstated how much it had submitted to the food and drug administration that the company couldnt uphold its partnerships with companies like walgreens which ended its partnership with theranos back in june closing  wellness center locations heres theranos response the suit filed by a hedge fund is without merit and theranos will fight it vigorously the hedge fund is engaging in revisionist history making claims that are not rooted in facts the company remains committed to its mission and is appreciative of its strong investor base that understands and continues to support those efforts see also theranos withdraws its comeback test for zika just a month after announcing it dont miss theranos presented new products to scientists who were expecting data — and it didnt go
