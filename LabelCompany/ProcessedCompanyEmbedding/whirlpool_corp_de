under the brands hotpoint indesit creda swan and proline and manufactured over an year period between april  and september  present a fire risk an estimated  million tumble dryers were bought in the uk over the time period originally and even after several fires were confirmed as being caused by faulty devices whirlpool advised customers that using such devices was safe provided they were not left unattended but would not issue a product recall whirlpool offered to fix faulty machines or replace tumble dryers at a cost of £  an offer met with derision with consumer groups and in the press parliament discussed widespread difficulties with getting faulty machines fixed or replaced including long wait times and poor service on friday  august  a fire broke out on the th floor of an storey shepherds court building in shepherds bush green resulting in hundreds of residents needing to be evacuated london fire brigade said  fire engines and  firefighters were sent to tackle the blaze at pm and that it was under control by pm shadwell fire station manager paul hobbs said the fire spread from the seventh floor via the outside of the building the blaze spread upwards to engulf  storeys damaging flats from the seventh to eleventh storeys the occupants were at home when smoke started pouring out of the tumble dryer and they alerted fire crews with the fire later confirmed as being caused by a faulty indesit branded whirlpool tumble dryer at the time whirlpool advised customers that ”you may continue to use your tumble dryer whilst waiting for the modification however we require that you do not leave your dryer unattended during operation as an extra precaution ie do not leave the house or leave the dryer on whilst asleep” but would not issue a product recall on  august  london fire brigade advised the public to stop all use of faulty tumble dryers immediately and through its total recall campaign called on whirlpool to change its advice to customers and promote a product recall advice also issued by which and the expect its safe campaign set up by lawyers representing victims of fires started by faulty appliances the london fire brigade commented that they get called out to a fire started by faulty domestic appliances nearly once every day and issued a fivepoint notice concerning whirlpools advice on faulty appliances the safety notice was issued due to the danger of fire and any fire has the potential to endanger life and property it’s impractical for most people to remain with an appliance for the duration of a drying cycle if the dryer does catch fire while it’s attended this still presents a risk to the occupants if the owner attempts to put out a fire in an appliance they could be putting their life at risk the brigade’s advice is to not risk tackling the fire always raise the alarm get out stay out and call  the time a fire may break out because of a fault is unpredictable the ignition of fluff accumulated around a heating element may cause a smouldering fire which might not be discovered until the appliance has finished being used and the owner has gone to bed in september  andy slaughter the mp for hammersmith whose constituency includes shepards bush said the government had failed to stand up to the “powerful industry lobby” representing white goods manufacturers he was reported to have urged ministers to instruct whirlpool and other companies to change their advice to customers and insisted that faulty appliances that may cause fires be recalled and replaced in a session of parliament on  september  slaughter revealed that he had tracked down  fires caused by whirlpool dryers and by dryers from brands owned by whirlpool between  and  we know about  models but whirlpool will not publish the full list alberto acosta mp for south leicestershire described whirlpools handling of the issue adding i am a consumer of the said faulty tumble dryer having bought one last year the hon gentleman andy slaughter mp and i have already spoken briefly about this matter but i should like to further inform him that i wrote to the managing director of whirlpool uk maurizio pettorino in april this year he took a month to respond and his response was appalling he did not answer the questions i had put to him i wrote to him again on  may but he has not responded to my letter nor has he responded to my repeated telephone calls a public affairs company called ketchum is involved in this matter but it is refusing to respond to my reasonable requests like many consumers i filled out the online whirlpool form and was told i would have to wait  weeks before being given a date those  weeks have come and gone but i have not received a date does the hon gentleman agree that it is time that maurizio pettorino thought about resigning from his job patricia gibson mp for north ayrshire and arran added that regarding customers waiting for faulty dryer repairs or replacements she had a constituent who has been told she will have to wait at least  months and she is now about halfway through that wait there is no apparent end in sight and this is a real evasion of responsibility the same month following the publication of the investigation results into the shepards bush blaze that concluded the faulty tumble dryer was to blame for starting the fire and other fires across the uk pressure grew on whirlpool and the government to do more to reassure the public dave brown london fire brigades director of operations said “this fire has highlighted just how dangerous faulty white goods can be disappointingly though whirlpool have still not changed their advice to consumers we are now appealing once again for them to change their advice and bring it into line with our own thankfully there were no serious injuries in the shepherd’s bush fire but we may not be so lucky if it happens again” in october  margot james the british governments customer minister said “customer safety must be the number one priority for manufacturers i acknowledge that whirlpool are making great efforts to modify and replace atrisk machines but i believe additional action is required to reassure customers and the public i will be writing to the company to set out my concerns and expectations” in december  the uks largest customer advocacy group which who had previously produced a list of the  models of tumble dryer at risk took the unusual step to seeking a judicial review of peterborough trading standards  the agency named as responsible for handling of the faulty tumble dryers sold by whirlpool  labelling the handling as a “fiasco” and claiming that it has failed millions of consumers across the uk by not enforcing product safety laws peterborough city council had been dealing with whirlpool because its uk head office is located in the city the move was considered unusual as it was the first time which had made a formal legal move involving trading standards in order to assess the lawfulness of its decision to allow householders to continue to use faulty machines despite the risk of them bursting into flames leon livermore chief executive of the chartered trading standards institute was critical of whirlpool not recalling faulty tumble dryers urging whirlpool to recall the millions of potentially faulty tumble dryers in peoples homes but came to the defence of peterborough trading standards saying the whole system has been overwhelmed by the size of this and it’s a bit unfair on a local authority such as peterborough to have to take responsibility for what is a national issue” in response to the criticism a peterborough city council spokesman said “an independent review which began earlier this month is currently taking place and we would expect the company to fully comply with the outcome we will strongly defend our position if which is granted a judicial review and bearing in mind the ongoing independent review we consider that this action is premature” on  february  whirlpool received two enforcement notices from peterborough trading standards following the trading standards internal review  months after whirlpool advised customers that it was safe to continue using faulty tumble dryers providing they were not left unattended it was required to update its advice to customers advising them to unplug the appliances and stop using them until they were repaired whirlpool was also required to publicise the changed advice to consumers through advertisements in national newspapers through social media and in stores the enforcement notices had been originally issued on  january  and were rejected by whirlpool who filed for an appeal that was then rejected had the company not complied with the notices at this point it would have been taken to court according to the guardian the latest action followed “an escalation” in the number of incidents caused by affected machines as of  february  a consumer action campaign had gathered  signatures to challenge whirlpool and call on government to force action on firerisk dryers a separate petition to call on the government to urge whirlpool uk to recall all faulty tumble dryers sponsored by politician andy slaughter mp had gathered  signatures some customers even reported tumble dryers setting alight after being fixed diversityedit whirlpool corporation has seven employeerun diversity

recalling faulty tumble dryers urging whirlpool to recall the millions of potentially faulty tumble dryers in peoples homes but came to the defence of peterborough trading standards saying the whole system has been overwhelmed by the size of this and it’s a bit unfair on a local authority such as peterborough to have to take responsibility for what is a national issue” in response to the criticism a peterborough city council spokesman said “an independent review which began earlier this month is currently taking place and we would expect the company to fully comply with the outcome we will strongly defend our position if which is granted a judicial review and bearing in mind the ongoing independent review we consider that this action is premature” on  february  whirlpool received

required to publicise the changed advice to consumers through advertisements in national newspapers through social media and in stores the enforcement notices had been originally issued on  january

after several fires were confirmed as being caused by faulty devices whirlpool advised customers that using such devices was safe provided they were not left unattended but would not issue a product recall whirlpool offered to fix faulty machines or replace tumble dryers at a cost of £  an offer met with derision with consumer groups and in the press parliament discussed widespread difficulties with getting faulty machines fixed or replaced including long wait times and poor service on friday  august  a fire broke out on the th floor of an storey shepherds court building in shepherds bush green resulting in hundreds of residents needing to be evacuated london fire brigade said  fire engines and  firefighters were sent to tackle the blaze at pm and that it was under control by pm shadwell fire station manager paul hobbs said the fire spread from the seventh floor via the outside of the building the blaze spread upwards to engulf  storeys damaging flats from the seventh to eleventh storeys the occupants were at home when smoke started pouring out of the tumble dryer and they alerted fire crews with the fire later confirmed as being caused by a faulty indesit branded whirlpool tumble dryer at the time whirlpool advised customers that ”you may continue to use your tumble dryer whilst waiting for the modification however we require that you do not leave your dryer unattended during operation as an extra precaution ie do not leave the house or leave the dryer on whilst asleep” but would not issue a product recall on  august  london fire brigade advised the public to stop all use of faulty tumble dryers immediately and through its total recall campaign called on whirlpool to change its advice to customers and promote a product recall advice also issued by which and the expect its safe campaign set up by lawyers representing victims of fires started by faulty appliances the london fire brigade commented that they get called out to a fire started by faulty domestic appliances nearly once every day and issued a fivepoint notice concerning whirlpools advice on faulty appliances the safety notice was issued due to the danger of fire and any fire has the potential to endanger life and property it’s impractical for most people to remain with an appliance for the duration of a drying cycle if the dryer does catch fire while it’s attended this still presents a risk to the occupants if the owner attempts to put out a fire in an appliance they could be putting their life at risk the brigade’s advice is to not risk tackling the fire always raise the alarm get out stay out and call  the time a fire may break out because of a fault is unpredictable the ignition of fluff accumulated around a heating element may cause a smouldering fire which might not be discovered until the appliance has finished being used and the owner has gone to bed in september  andy slaughter the mp for hammersmith whose constituency includes shepards bush said the government had failed to stand up to the “powerful industry lobby” representing white goods manufacturers he was reported to have urged ministers to instruct whirlpool and other companies to change their advice to customers and insisted that faulty appliances that may cause fires be recalled and replaced in a session of parliament on  september  slaughter revealed that he had tracked down  fires caused by whirlpool dryers and by dryers from brands owned by whirlpool between  and  we know about  models but whirlpool will not publish the full list alberto acosta mp for south leicestershire described whirlpools handling of the issue adding i am a consumer of the said faulty tumble dryer having bought one last year the hon gentleman andy slaughter mp and i have already spoken briefly about this matter but i should like to further inform him that i wrote to the managing director of whirlpool uk maurizio pettorino in april this year he took a month to respond and his response was appalling he did not answer the questions i had put to him i wrote to him again on  may but he has not responded to my letter nor has he responded to my repeated telephone calls a public affairs company called ketchum is involved in this matter but it is refusing to respond to my reasonable requests like many consumers i filled out the online whirlpool form and was told i would have to wait  weeks before being given a date those  weeks have come and gone but i have not received a date does the hon gentleman agree that it is time that maurizio pettorino thought about resigning from his job patricia gibson mp for north ayrshire and arran added that regarding customers waiting for faulty dryer repairs or replacements she had a constituent who has been told she will have to wait at least  months and she is now about halfway through that wait there is no apparent end in sight and this is a real evasion of responsibility the same month following the publication of the investigation results into the shepards bush blaze that concluded the faulty tumble dryer was to blame for starting the fire and other fires across the uk pressure grew on whirlpool and the government to do more to reassure the public dave brown london fire brigades director of operations said “this fire has highlighted just how dangerous faulty white goods can be disappointingly though whirlpool have still not changed their advice to consumers we are now appealing once again for them to change their advice and bring it into line with our own thankfully there were no serious injuries in the shepherd’s bush fire but we may not be so lucky if it happens again” in october  margot james the british governments customer minister said “customer safety must be the number one priority for manufacturers i acknowledge that whirlpool are making great efforts to modify and replace atrisk machines but i believe additional action is required to reassure customers and the public i will be writing to the company to set out my concerns and expectations” in december  the uks largest customer advocacy group which who had previously produced a list of the  models of tumble dryer at risk took the unusual step to seeking a judicial review of peterborough trading standards  the agency named as responsible for handling of the faulty tumble dryers sold by whirlpool  labelling the handling as a “fiasco” and claiming that it has failed millions of consumers across the uk by not enforcing product safety laws peterborough city council had been dealing with whirlpool because its uk head office is located in the city the move was considered unusual as it was the first time which had made a formal legal move involving trading standards in order to assess the lawfulness of its decision to allow

and proline and manufactured over an year period between april  and september  present a fire risk an estimated  million tumble dryers were bought in the uk over the time period originally and even after several fires were confirmed as being caused by faulty devices whirlpool advised customers that using such devices was safe provided they were not left unattended but would not issue a product recall whirlpool offered to fix faulty machines or replace tumble dryers at a cost of £  an offer met with derision with consumer groups and in the press parliament discussed widespread difficulties with getting faulty machines fixed or replaced including long wait times and poor service on friday  august  a fire broke out on the th floor of an storey shepherds court building in shepherds bush green resulting in hundreds of residents needing to be evacuated london fire brigade said  fire engines and  firefighters were sent to tackle the blaze at pm and that it was under control by pm shadwell fire station manager paul hobbs said the fire spread from the seventh floor via the outside of the building the blaze spread upwards to engulf  storeys damaging flats from the seventh to eleventh storeys the occupants were at home when smoke started pouring out of the tumble dryer and they alerted fire crews with the fire later confirmed as being caused by a faulty indesit branded whirlpool tumble dryer at the time whirlpool advised customers that ”you may continue to use your tumble dryer whilst waiting for the modification however we require that you do not leave your dryer unattended during operation as an extra precaution ie do not leave the house or leave the dryer on whilst asleep” but would not issue a product recall on  august  london fire brigade advised the public to stop all use of faulty tumble dryers immediately and through its total recall campaign called on whirlpool to change its advice to customers and promote a product recall advice also issued by which and the expect its safe campaign set up by lawyers representing victims of fires started by faulty appliances the london fire brigade commented that they get called out to a fire started by faulty domestic appliances nearly once every day and issued a fivepoint notice concerning whirlpools advice on faulty appliances the safety notice was issued due to the danger of fire and any fire has the potential to endanger life and property it’s impractical for most people to remain with an appliance for the duration of a drying cycle if the dryer does catch fire while it’s attended this still presents a risk to the occupants if the owner attempts to put out a fire in an appliance they could be putting their life at risk the brigade’s advice is to not risk tackling the fire always raise the alarm get out stay out and call  the time a fire may break out because of a fault is unpredictable the ignition of fluff accumulated around a heating element may cause a smouldering fire which might not be discovered until the appliance has finished being used and the owner has gone to bed in september  andy slaughter the mp for hammersmith whose constituency includes shepards bush said the government had failed to stand up to the “powerful industry lobby” representing white goods manufacturers he was reported to have urged ministers to instruct whirlpool and other companies to change their advice to customers and insisted that faulty appliances that may cause fires be recalled and replaced in a session of parliament on  september  slaughter revealed that he had tracked down  fires caused by whirlpool dryers and by dryers from brands owned by whirlpool between  and  we know about  models but whirlpool will not publish the full list alberto acosta mp for south leicestershire described whirlpools handling of the issue adding i am a consumer of the said faulty tumble dryer having bought one last year the hon gentleman andy slaughter mp and i have already spoken briefly about this matter but i should like to further inform him that i wrote to the managing director of whirlpool uk maurizio pettorino in april this year he took a month to respond and his response was appalling he did not answer the questions i had put to him i wrote to him again on  may but he has not responded to my letter nor has he responded to my repeated telephone calls a public affairs company called ketchum is involved in this matter but it is refusing to respond to my reasonable requests like many consumers i filled out the online whirlpool form and was told i would have to wait  weeks before being given a date those  weeks have come and gone but i have not received a date does the hon gentleman agree that it is time that maurizio pettorino thought about resigning from his job patricia gibson mp for north ayrshire and arran added that regarding customers waiting for faulty dryer repairs or replacements she had a constituent who has been told she will have to wait at least  months and she is now about halfway through that wait there is no apparent end in sight and this is a real evasion of responsibility the same month following the publication of the investigation results into the shepards bush blaze that concluded the faulty tumble dryer was to blame for starting the fire and other fires across the uk pressure grew on whirlpool and the government to do more to reassure the public dave brown london fire brigades director of operations said “this fire has highlighted just how dangerous faulty white goods can be disappointingly though whirlpool have still not changed their advice to consumers we are now appealing once again for them to change their advice and bring it into line with our own thankfully there were no serious injuries in the shepherd’s bush fire but we may not be so lucky if it happens again” in october  margot james the british governments customer minister said “customer safety must be the number one priority for manufacturers i acknowledge that whirlpool are making great efforts to modify and replace atrisk machines but i believe additional action is required to reassure customers and the public i will be writing to the company to set out my concerns and expectations” in december  the uks largest customer advocacy group which who had previously produced a list of the  models of tumble dryer at risk took the unusual step to seeking a judicial review of peterborough trading standards  the agency named as responsible for handling of the faulty tumble dryers sold by whirlpool  labelling the handling as a “fiasco” and claiming that it has failed millions of consumers across the uk by not enforcing product safety laws peterborough city council had been dealing with whirlpool because its uk head office is located in the city the move was considered unusual as it was the first time which had made a formal legal move involving trading standards in order to assess the lawfulness of its decision to allow householders to continue to use faulty machines despite the risk of them bursting into flames leon livermore chief executive of the chartered trading standards institute was critical of whirlpool not recalling faulty tumble dryers urging whirlpool to recall the millions of potentially faulty tumble dryers in peoples homes but came to the defence of peterborough trading standards saying the whole system has been overwhelmed by the size of this and it’s a bit unfair on a local authority such as peterborough to have to take responsibility for what is a national issue” in response to the criticism a peterborough city council spokesman said “an independent review which began earlier this month is currently taking place and we would expect the company to fully comply with the outcome we will strongly defend our position if which is granted a judicial review and bearing in mind the ongoing independent review we consider that this action is premature” on  february  whirlpool received two enforcement notices from peterborough trading standards following the trading standards internal review  months after whirlpool advised customers that it was safe to continue using faulty tumble dryers providing they were not left unattended it was required to update its advice to customers advising them to unplug the appliances and stop using them until they were repaired whirlpool was also required to publicise the changed advice to consumers through advertisements in national newspapers through social media and in stores the enforcement notices had been originally issued on  january  and were rejected by whirlpool who filed for an appeal that was then rejected had the company not complied with the notices at this point it would have been taken to court according to the guardian the latest action followed “an escalation” in the number of incidents caused by affected machines as of  february  a consumer action campaign had gathered  signatures to challenge whirlpool and call on government to force action on firerisk dryers a separate petition to call on the government to urge whirlpool uk to recall all faulty tumble dryers sponsored by politician andy slaughter mp had gathered  signatures some customers even reported tumble dryers setting alight after being fixed diversityedit whirlpool corporation has seven employeerun diversity networks that are involved with

some rare cases excess fluff can come into contact with the heating element and present a risk of fire” whirlpool condensers and vented tumble dryers sold under the brands hotpoint indesit creda swan and proline and manufactured over an year period between april  and september  present a fire risk an estimated  million tumble dryers were bought in the uk over the time period originally and even after several fires were confirmed as being caused by faulty devices whirlpool advised customers that using such devices was safe provided they were not left unattended but would not issue a product recall whirlpool offered to fix faulty machines or replace tumble dryers at a cost of £  an offer met with derision with consumer groups and in the press parliament discussed widespread difficulties with getting faulty machines fixed or replaced including long wait times and poor service on friday  august  a fire broke out on the th floor of an storey shepherds court building in shepherds bush green resulting in hundreds of residents needing to be evacuated london fire brigade said  fire engines and  firefighters were sent to tackle the blaze at pm and that it was under control by pm shadwell fire station manager paul hobbs said the fire spread from the seventh floor via the outside of the building the blaze spread upwards to engulf  storeys damaging flats from the seventh to eleventh storeys the occupants were at home when smoke started pouring out of the tumble dryer and they alerted fire crews with the fire later confirmed as being caused by a faulty indesit branded whirlpool tumble dryer at the time whirlpool advised customers that ”you may continue to use your tumble dryer whilst waiting for the modification however we require that you do not leave your dryer unattended during operation as an extra precaution ie do not leave the house or leave the dryer on whilst asleep” but would not issue a product recall on  august  london fire brigade advised the public to stop all use of faulty tumble dryers immediately and through its total recall campaign called on whirlpool to change its advice to customers and promote a product recall advice also issued by which and the expect its safe campaign set up by lawyers representing victims of fires started by faulty appliances the london fire brigade commented that they get called out to a fire started by faulty domestic appliances nearly once every day and issued a fivepoint notice concerning whirlpools advice on faulty appliances the safety notice was issued due to the danger of fire and any fire has the potential to endanger life and property it’s impractical for most people to remain with an appliance for the duration of a drying cycle if the dryer does catch fire while it’s attended this still presents a risk to the occupants if the owner attempts to put out a fire in an appliance they could be putting their life at risk the brigade’s advice is to not risk tackling the fire always raise the alarm get out stay out and call  the time a fire may break out because of a fault is unpredictable the ignition of fluff accumulated around a heating element may cause a smouldering fire which might not be discovered until the appliance has finished being used and the owner has gone to bed in september  andy slaughter the mp for hammersmith whose constituency includes shepards bush said the government had failed to stand up to the “powerful industry lobby” representing white goods manufacturers he was reported to have urged ministers to instruct whirlpool and other companies to change their advice to customers and insisted that faulty appliances that may cause fires be recalled and replaced in a session of parliament on  september  slaughter revealed that he had tracked down  fires caused by whirlpool dryers and by dryers from brands owned by whirlpool between  and  we know about  models but whirlpool will not publish the full list alberto acosta mp for south leicestershire described whirlpools handling of the issue adding i am a consumer of the said faulty tumble dryer having bought one last year the hon gentleman andy slaughter mp and i have already spoken briefly about this matter but i should like to further inform him that i wrote to the managing director of whirlpool uk maurizio pettorino in april this year he took a month to respond and his response was appalling he did not answer the questions i had put to him i wrote to him again on  may but he has not responded to my letter nor has he responded to my repeated telephone calls a public affairs company called ketchum is involved in this matter but it is refusing to respond to my reasonable requests like many consumers i filled out the online whirlpool form and was told i would have to wait  weeks before being given a date those  weeks have come and gone but i have not received a date does the hon gentleman agree that it is time that maurizio pettorino thought about resigning from his job patricia gibson mp for north ayrshire and arran added that regarding customers waiting for faulty dryer repairs or replacements she had a constituent who has been told she will have to wait at least  months and she is now about halfway through that wait there is no apparent end in sight and this is a real evasion of responsibility the same month following the publication of the investigation results into the shepards bush blaze that concluded the faulty tumble dryer was to blame for starting the fire and other fires across the uk pressure grew on whirlpool and the government to do more to reassure the public dave brown london fire brigades director of operations said “this fire has highlighted just how dangerous faulty white goods can be disappointingly though whirlpool have still not changed their advice to consumers we are now appealing once again for them to change their advice and bring it into line with our own thankfully there were no serious injuries in the shepherd’s bush fire but we may not be so lucky if it happens again” in october  margot james the british governments customer minister said “customer safety must be the number one priority for manufacturers i acknowledge that whirlpool are making great efforts to modify and replace atrisk machines but i believe additional action is required to reassure customers and the public i will be writing to the company to set out my concerns and expectations” in december  the uks largest customer advocacy group which who had previously produced a list of the  models of tumble dryer at risk took the unusual step to seeking a judicial review of peterborough trading standards  the agency named as responsible for handling of the faulty tumble dryers sold by whirlpool  labelling the handling as a “fiasco” and claiming that it has failed millions of consumers across the uk by not enforcing product safety laws peterborough city council had been dealing with whirlpool because its uk head office is located in the city the move was considered unusual as it was the first time which had made a formal legal move involving trading standards in order to assess the lawfulness of its decision to allow householders to continue to use faulty machines despite the risk of them bursting into flames leon livermore chief executive of the chartered trading standards institute was critical of whirlpool not recalling faulty tumble dryers urging whirlpool to recall the millions of potentially faulty tumble dryers in peoples homes but came to the defence of peterborough trading standards saying the whole system has been overwhelmed by the size of this and it’s a bit unfair on a local authority such as peterborough to have to take responsibility for what is a national issue” in response to the criticism a peterborough city council spokesman said “an independent review which began earlier this month is currently taking place and we would expect the company to fully comply with the outcome we will strongly defend our position if which is granted a judicial review and bearing in mind the ongoing independent review we consider that this action is premature” on  february  whirlpool received two enforcement notices from peterborough trading standards following the trading standards internal review  months after whirlpool advised customers that it was safe to continue using faulty tumble dryers providing they were not left unattended it was required to update its advice to customers advising them to unplug the appliances and stop using them until they were repaired whirlpool was also required to publicise the changed advice to consumers through advertisements in national newspapers through social media and in stores the enforcement notices had been originally issued on  january  and were rejected by whirlpool who filed for an appeal that was then rejected had the company not complied with the notices at this point it would have been taken to court according to the guardian the latest action followed “an escalation” in the number of incidents caused by affected machines as of  february  a consumer action campaign had gathered  signatures to challenge whirlpool and call on government to force action on firerisk dryers a separate petition to call on the government to urge whirlpool uk to recall all faulty tumble dryers sponsored by politician andy slaughter mp had gathered  signatures some customers even reported tumble dryers setting alight after being fixed diversityedit whirlpool corporation has seven employeerun diversity networks that are involved with
