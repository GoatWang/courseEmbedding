the boston properties inc  stock option and incentive plan the “plan” on january   the compensation committee the “committee” of the board of directors the “board” of boston properties inc the “company” the general partner of boston properties limited approved outperformance awards under the plan to officers and key employees of the company these awards the “ opp awards” are part of a broadbased longterm incentive compensation program generally referred to as an “outperformance plan” designed to provide the company’s management team at several levels within the organization with the potential to earn equity awards subject to the company creating shareholder value in a payforperformance structure in  the committee implemented a similar program whereby recipients of  outperformance awards would share in an outperformance pool if the company’s total return to shareholders “trs” including both share appreciation and dividends exceeds absolute and relative hurdles over the period from february   to february   recipients of  outperformance awards are not expected to earn any rewards under the  program  opp awards utilize trs over a threeyear measurement period as the performance metric and include two years of timebased vesting after the end of the performance measurement period subject to acceleration in certain events as a retention tool recipients of  opp awards will share in an outperformance pool if the company’s trs including both share appreciation and dividends exceeds absolute and relative hurdles over a threeyear measurement period from february   to january   based on the average closing price of a share of the company’s common stock a “reit share” for the five trading days prior to and including february   the aggregate reward that recipients of all  opp awards can earn as measured by the outperformance pool is subject to a maximum cap of  million the company expects that under the financial accounting standards board’s accounting standards codification “asc”  “compensation – stock compensation” the  opp awards will have an aggregate value of approximately  million which amount will be amortized into earnings over the fiveyear plan period under the graded vesting method the outperformance pool will consist of i two percent  of the excess total return above a cumulative absolute trs hurdle of  over the full threeyear measurement period equivalent to  per annum the “absolute trs component” and ii two percent  of the excess or deficient excess total return above or below a relative trs hurdle equal to the total return of the snl equity reit index over the threeyear measurement period the “relative trs component” in the event that the relative trs component is potentially positive because the company’s trs is greater than the total return of the snl equity reit index but the company achieves a cumulative absolute trs below  over the threeyear measurement period equivalent to  per annum the actual contribution to the outperformance pool from the relative trs component will be subject to a sliding scale factor as follows i  of the potential relative trs component will be earned if the company’s trs is equal to or greater than a cumulative  over three years ii  will be earned if the company’s trs is  or less and iii a percentage from  to  calculated by linear interpolation will be earned if the company’s cumulative trs over three years is between  and  for example if the company achieves a cumulative absolute trs of  over the full threeyear measurement period equivalent to a  absolute annual trs the        potential relative trs component would be prorated by  the potential relative trs component before application of the sliding scale factor will be capped at  million in the event that the relative trs component is negative because the company’s trs is less than the total return of the snl equity reit index any outperformance reward potentially earned under the absolute trs component will be reduced dollar for dollar provided that the potential absolute trs component before reduction for any negative relative trs component will be capped at  million the algebraic sum of the absolute trs component and the relative trs component determined as described above will never exceed  million each employee’s  opp award will be designated as a specified percentage of the aggregate outperformance pool assuming the applicable absolute andor relative trs thresholds are achieved at the end of the measurement period the algebraic sum of the absolute trs component and the relative trs component will be calculated and then allocated among the  opp award recipients in accordance with each individual’s percentage rewards earned with respec boston properties limited

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
