francisco blog icon george marcus talks process and strategy posted on april   by dana van galder sharesharetweetemail the new icon series continues to be a popular uli draw with a second sold out event  on march  members were treated to a rare interview with george marcus cofounder and chairman of marcus  millichap company parent company of a diversified group of real estate service investment and development firms  the evening was led by his friend mike covarrubias chairman and ceo of tmg  not only did uli members hear the start of the largest commercial investment real estate brokerage firm in the nation and were entertained by covarrubias’ slideshow of marcus through the years and rubbing elbows with prominent politicians and world leaders but were also privy to the genesis of a popular san francisco restaurant tell about a day in your life a dealjunkie  from the beginning marcus explained his interest was in improving the industry and forming organizations that really were businesses “the notion that i do deals is really a misnomer i organize companies that strategize to think of better way to be involved in multiple deals no matter that business you are in you have to have a defined strategy whether building one building or in my case hundreds of buildings” a great joy  one of marcus’ principles is creating companies that sustain beyond him  he is most proud of essex property trust with forbes ranking essex the third most trusted company in america and morgan stanley rating it as the public company with the greatest prospects over the next five years  “it’s trust  and its those kind of things that make a difference” on marcus  millichap and moving out of the way  “when bill millichap came into my office in  that was the luckiest day in my life” marcus told the room “while it took a long time to get the brokerage firm going bill was excellent at it”  marcus realized if he remained ceo he could lose bill  exercising a fundamental premise in his career marcus then “moved out of the way” and started essex  he again later moved out of the way at essex for keith guericke to take the helm  he shared “i’m more of a strategist and a personnel person  when i realized i had talent at the door i wanted to give them all the responsibility they could take and i wanted them to grow” essex has since produced over  a year to shareholders annually  warren buffet isn’t close  marcus explained that while he’s been involved in starting  to  businesses his career is not about a deal but about the process and a strategy talking about   no one was ready for a capital meltdown and marcus finds it hard to believe that we did not understand this was possible  despite marcus  millichap companies being in homebuilding and never having any marginal credit people buying they got hurt  as for advice to the members “if you can act first  if you see prices going down go down faster and make the deal because it’s going to continue to go down” covarrubias credited the “behind the curtain” financial position and strong portfolio of marcus’ companies for weathering the unpredictable black swan  marcus stressed the importance of diverse companies and the ability for the businesses to operate differently  “service businesses don’t line up with development companies and investment businesses are completely different  diversity matters” the value of uli  “it is the people” marcus explained about uli “friends in the same industry sharing information without telling the secret sauce but most of it”  he compared it to being at a university where people have a lot in common advice to one starting in this industry  the business is unsophisticated and has no training programs unless one works for a bank or real estate division  he emphasized a hard fact of finding mentors and somehow managing to work for them  in some business situations like theirs young mbas had year rotations for homebuilding investments and development  however the reits have changed that and there lie opportunities as the ranks need to be filled with the first round of executives getting older san francisco is an island but is it a bubble  marcus simply stated that no one really knows we have a very robust economy but every product and business is a little different  while admitting it sounded corny he emphasized one has to have a plan and one has to work it  “generally neighborhood retail is bulletproof once you have the anchor tenant  the extreme is specing high rise downtown office buildings i never understood that” our speaker confessed making the restaurant business work  there was no one properly representing greek food and no one goes to a greek restaurant  marcus and his restaurant partner noted “if italians can do it we can do it”  their own research revealed that people liked greece’s hospitality but not really the food  with evvia they disguised it as a mediterranean restaurant hired a french chef taught him the greek recipes and smothered patrons with service  the next success was kokkari  covarrubias drew similarities of the venture to marcus’ real estate successes with the aspects of research client focus
