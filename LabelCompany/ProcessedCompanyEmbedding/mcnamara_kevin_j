backchannel scholars in the news press contact information news search scholars in the news associate scholar kevin mcnamara interviewed by czech newspaper lidovky on latest book july   it is exactly one hundred years since the czechoslovak legionnaires first came to attention at the battle of zborov in today’s western ukraine  exiled professor tomáš garrigue masaryk recruited the legionnaires from among czech and slovak pows in russia and a few thousand more who fought for allied russia in world war one  “although he had no military experience masaryk created an army that won independence for the czechoslovaks  this and other achievements rank him as a great man” says kevin j mcnamara author of the first major book about the czechoslovak legion in english in about  years who talks about the siberian anabasis of the czech and slovak legionnaires and about masaryk in this lidovky interview the battle of zborov in july  was a foretaste of the astonishing things the legionnaires would later manage to accomplish after russia left the war forcing them to defend themselves by fighting their way at least  miles from the ural mountains to vladivostok by the end of   in the summer of  they even took over the entire transsiberian railway for a while “i think the power of this story is that it is about an undistinguished array of shopkeepers dentists farmers factory hands and bank clerks who were plucked from obscurity and plunged into world war one fought on the eastern front and then fought their way across siberia under terrible conditions” says mcnamara author of the book dreams of a great small nation   lidovky  what is the level of awareness of world war one in the united states i think the average american knows we fought in that war but many people probably confuse the first with the second world war  most americans are not well versed in history lidovky  are american college and secondary students taught about such subjects yes but history curricula in both secondary schools and higher education emphasize the “western” part of western civilization so that the focus is almost entirely on world war one’s western front  the eastern front where the story of my book takes place is almost entirely absent  the arc of world history in most american history survey courses starts with the ancient world moving from jerusalem to athens to rome then has something to say about the middle ages and then focuses on france and great britain and the founding of the united states moving from rome to london to philadelphia  eastern europe and russia tend to get short shrift even germany does not make an appearance until hitler surfaces very little is said of the holy roman empire or austriahungary or the very high state of german culture  even american specialists in history with doctoral degrees confessed to me that they did not really know the full story of the czechoslovak legion  in works on the russian civil war the role of the czechoslovak legion is mentioned largely in passing summarized in a few paragraphs  read the full interview here  read more about kevin j mcnamara the foreign policy research institute founded in  is a nonpartisan

archive kevin mcnamara allstar game never should have counted monday jul   at  pm kevin mcnamara journal sports writer kevinmcnamara a few thoughts observations and news items while wondering which south county beach new jersey’s chris christie will invade during a timeout from this week’s national governor’s association meetings allstar game the last vestige of excommissioner bud selig’s awful idea to award home field in the world series to the winner of the midsummer classic is over tuesday’s baseball allstar game is all about fun and games as it should be back in  selig overreacted to the embarrassment of the allstar game ending in a  tie when the teams ran out of pitching after  innings four of the  pitchers used that night couldn’t muster a full inning of work so selig shouldve tossed a good chunk of blame to the two managers joe torre and bob brenly instead the commissioner who couldnt police steroids or give his smallmarket franchises a fighting chance felt that attaching some weight to the allstar game would elevate interest in the exhibition from both players and the fans that didn’t happen what we’d love to see are more innings and atbats for the stars let’s watch american league starter chris sale throw at least two innings give me three atbats from mookie betts aaron judge and carlos correa if we catch only a glimpse of al reserves brandon kintzler avisail garcia or francisco lindor no one will complain by the way the red sox fans owe uncle bud a thank you his goofy idea for home field via the allstar game helped the sox win all three    of their modernday world series kelly olynyk million man it used to be that mommas could wish for their babies to grow up to be overpriced lefty relievers now you could do worse than being a slow power forward thanks to a new flood of television money some crazy contracts are flowing through the nba these days the stars are seeing deals that would make hedgefund titans blush james harden just signed an extension that will pay upwards of  million a season although he’s won only one playoff series in his career the celtics will send  million gordon haywards way over the next four years the big dollars are filtering to the next level guys as well olynyk barely averaged  minutes a game with the celtics but cashed in bigtime with the miami heat the knicks dug themselves further into oblivion by signing tim hardaway jr to a fouryear million deal this is all due to a superb labor deal that must make the fools in the insanely popular nfl furious two key provisions in the nba’s deal guarantees all contracts and states that  percent of the gross revenue goes to the players the nba now receives  billion a year from espn and tnt deals that the networks will struggle to afford also the next time you read that shelvin mack cj miles and bojan bogdanovic are cashing in big remember to root for the players they need the dough a lot more than the billionaire owners uconn crying poor the hartford courant reported last week that uconn athletic department leaders are concerned about likely revenue challenges in the near future multimillion payouts that the huskies have received from the dissolution of the big east five years ago are due to run out next year combined with a sharp attendance drop in football the department is facing major shortfalls as it fights to remain nationally relevant in the american athletic conference here are the numbers uconn received  million from the american in  the highest payout in the conference a large chunk came from money retained by uconn cincinnati and south florida when they split with the big east’s catholic schools once that revenue stream runs dry those schools could see checks more in line with the  million the american currently sends schools like memphis and houston that would be a nice disbursement if uconn wasn’t trying to play big boy football the big east for example pays schools like providence and villanova around  million but its members only focus on one major sport as a comparison schools playing in the power five football conferences blow away the huskies former rivals boston college and syracuse for example received  million from the atlantic coast conference in  the huskies are hoping for help in two areas first the american is praying the tv networks — or an outlet like google — will pay more to televise and stream its games they’re also hoping football fans get a bit more excited about games against central florida and smu average attendance was just  last year off nearly  from the big east
