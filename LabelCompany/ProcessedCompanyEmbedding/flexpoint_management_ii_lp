catastrophe bonds insurance linked securities reinsurance capital  investment risk transfer intelligence vloedman to launch redmond reinsurance investment interval fund share     read later copypaste link by artemis on march   a new ils and reinsurance linked interval fund is launching under the watch of exanchor risk advisors and experienced ils exec pete vloedman the redmond reinsurance investment interval fund is being launched with vloedman as its portfolio manager the ownership of this new mutual fund as an interval fund it comes under the ’s act is interesting with the adviser to the fund for whom vloedman will be working named as redmond capital management llc the ownership of redmond capital management is convoluted being a wholly owned subsidiary of redmond capital holdings llc which is in turn a direct subsidiary of geovera investment group ltd geovera interestingly is a provider of specialty residential property hurricane and earthquake insurance products largely in peak exposure zones the ultimate ownership is even more complex “geovera is majority owned by flexpoint fund ii cayman lp an alternative investment vehicle formed as a cayman islands exempted limited partnership under the control of its general partner flexpoint management ii cayman ltd which is under the control of its general partner flexpoint ultimate management ii cayman ltd which is ultimately under the control of edwards capital llc dba flexpoint ford llc “flexpoint” an illinois limited liability company flexpoint is a private equity investment firm based in chicago illinois” says the funds prospectus so ultimately it seems the ownership of redmond capital comes back to private equity money investing in insurance and reinsurance risks which now sees an opportunity to offer mutual fund investors a way to directly access the returns of insurance and reinsurance business as of  pete vloedman now works as a managing director of geovera insurance holdings inc and president of redmond capital previously he has been consulting in the ils and reinsurance space prior to which he was ceo of ils investment manager anchor risk advisors before which he was with magnetar capital and aj sterge vloedman has been in the ils and catastrophe bond space for many years so as portfolio manager for a new interval ils and reinsurance fund is well suited to the role vloedman will be responsible for daytoday portfolio management and investment decisions for the redmond reinsurance investment interval fund the fund will invest “primarily in reinsurancerelated securities commonly known as insurance linked securities “ils” ils may include eventlinked bonds also known as catastrophe or cat bonds structured reinsurance investments including but not limited to quota share instruments also known as “reinsurance sidecars” collateralized reinsurance investments and eventlinked swaps interests in pooled investment vehicles including registered investment companies that invest primarily in reinsurancerelated securities securities of companies in the insurance or reinsurance industries and other insurance and reinsurancerelated securities” so the full range of ils and reinsurancelinked investments will be used to construct the portfolio for the redmond reinsurance investment interval fund meaning both liquid and illiquid ils assets will be considered hence we assume the choice to launch the redmond reinsurance investment interval fund as a ’s act interval fund not only does the ’s act classification open the fund up to different types of investors via sales through registered investment advisers but the interval fund structure allows liquidity in the fund to be controlled to allow less liquid and often higher yielding ils investments to be made an ‘interval’ fund allows the investment manager to target a lessliquid portfolio of assets while still being able to offer investors liquidity opportunities at regular intervals in this way the investment manager can retain some control over redemption volumes while still leveraging lessliquid and typically the higher returning group of ils structures and assets the redmond reinsurance investment interval fund will offer its investors liquidity intervals with quarterly repurchase offerings typically for  of the fund’s shares these repurchase offers will be for at least  and not more than  of the fund’s outstanding shares every quarter the documentation explains also of note is the fact that the redmond reinsurance investment interval fund only has to invest  of its assets in ils and reinsurancelinked assets which will allow it to allocate the rest of the capital to liquid assets such as treasuries or money market funds that can then be liquidated easily to provide the liquidity necessary to redeem shares at the quarterly intervals redmond capital has signed a distribution agreement with alps distributors a wellknown mutual fund distribution services company and all sales will take place via alps this should give the redmond ils fund a platform to get in front of the investors it is seeking capital from the ultimate investors will need to buy into the redmond reinsurance interval fund via their registered investment advisors while a few other types of investors will also be allowed likely institutional this means that the redmond reinsurance investment interval fund will be accessible to retail investor money the minimum investment account size with the fund is to be set at m for registered investment advisors ria’s however within that m could be many endinvestors accessing the ils and reinsurance space with much smaller allocations we’d imagine we understand that shares in the redmond reinsurance investment interval fund will be offered at  each but at this time there is no information on how much capital the fund is targeting however being a mutual fund it will have to report to the sec regularly so we should get a sight of how successful this launch offering for the fund has been mutual funds investing in ils and reinsurancelinked assets have been very successful so far stone ridge asset management is the best example which has its own interval ils fund and has raised over  billion across three mutual ils funds with the interval fund attracting over  billion of capital mutual fund manager pioneer investments also launched an interval fund the pioneer ils interval fund for which it raised an initial m but we understand has grown since how far we’re unsure at this time the interval fund approach is extremely wellsuited to the ils and reinsurance linked asset class as it allows investments to be made in quota shares sidecars private collateralized deals and other less liquid ils assets which increasingly make up the bulk of the marketplace as a result the returns can be more attractive for investors too with these types of transaction offering better return possibilities and allowing the investment managers to target returns of  and upwards depending on the risk appetite of the fund and its investors redmond capital as the investment advisor and pete vloedman as the portfolio manager will no doubt seek to access as diverse a portfolio of transactions as possible once the capital has been raised from this initial offering of shares size will matter as for a new fund manager and ils fund entering the space there will be a requirement to prove the platform and concept before counterparties will welcome them to their deals especially in such a capital rich and competitive marketplace however vloedman’s history in the space and in reinsurance in general is sure to gain the redmond reinsurance investment interval fund access to enough interesting deals to start constructing a diversified portfolio as more ils mutual funds and interval funds targeting the reinsurance space launch the sector will increasingly have retail investor money in it some remain concerned about this prospect feeling that ils is a product for sophisticated institutional investors only whatever your feeling about more retail type investors accessing the ils space it is destined to continue to grow as a pool of capital thanks to mutual fund structures and some european ucits funds the onus will be on the investment manager and also the ria’s to advise clients and investors educate them on the risks and to be transparent in everything they do particularly when it comes to any losses as quickly as the more retail type of investor can enter the space they can easily leave it as well it will be interesting to watch how redmond capital and vloedman progress this new venture as this new mutual fund launches in the ils space how much capital the redmond reinsurance investment interval fund can raise in its first offering will likely be driven by how effectively marketed and distributed it is as well as how well the ria’s explain the product offering print pdfshare this
