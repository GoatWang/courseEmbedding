range of educational programs specifically for institutional investors   our history the founding of commonfund is one of the exciting stories of innovation in asset management to understand why return to the late s in this era investment returns from college endowments persistently lagged the rate of growth in operating budgets there was increasing concern throughout higher education regarding the future vitality of these institutions and many institutions faced problems of faculty compensation and deferred maintenance traditional endowment management as practiced at the time hampered trustees’ ability to address these issues but change was in the air thought leaders of the day were looking at the thennew concept of total return and thinking about allowing colleges to set their own spending rate one study managing educational endowments concluded that poor results were due to an overemphasis on avoiding losses and maximizing current income the ford foundation sponsored a landmark study the law and the lore of endowment funds published in 9 that served as a further catalyst for action out of this came a ford foundation grant of  million for the founding of the common fund for nonprofit organizations commonfund two years later july   the common fund was officially founded of the  million  was earmarked for research and publications — a tradition that continues today by the end of  a total of  endowments had invested  million we also launched our first investment fund the multistrategy equity fund initiating an approach to investing that later would become known as the endowment model milestones over the years commonfund has grown and expanded the range of investment funds and supporting services it offers its clients along the way key milestones in the

strategies client reporting portal contact us operating assets home    investments    operating assets the operating asset challenge and opportunity over our more than four decades of working with nonprofit institutions we have observed that many have excess liquidity and do not utilize best investment practices such as timeframe arbitrage and diversification in managing their operating assets commonfund is offering a comprehensive investment program structured to address this situation as many large operating entities are rethinking their fully liquid portfolios we believe best practice is to transition these investors from a daily liquid portfolio to a more appropriate diversified limitedterm portfolio dependent upon the risk tolerance of the individual organization the investment solutions may range from fixed income only to portfolios that include allocations to equities and alternatives due to liquidity needs and limited risk “appetites” these portfolios should not be endowmentlike in return expectation or volatility commonfund cash programs currently commonfund offers investment programs in liquid contingent and core levels for higher education investors we determine the “liquidity level” to be investments for daily needs to one year “contingent level” to be investments not needed for three years and “core level” to be up to five years for higher education institutions with significant cash portfolios we offer commonfund treasury program the treasury program offers operating asset investors a transition from a daily liquid portfolio to a more appropriate diversified limitedterm portfolio commonfund plays an advisory role as well as investment provider in treasury relationships the program is flexible and completely customized to the risk and return needs of each investor using the full range of options described in the chart below the program allows cash investors to earn a competitive return on their balances while maintaining the necessary risk controls and liquidity to reliably fund operations request for proposal submit your request today read now download sample policy download our sample operating asset investment policy
