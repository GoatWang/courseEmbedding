risks of each portfolio are described below see the statement of additional information for a description of each portfolio�s investment restrictions � investment objectives � the portfolios seek to � �maximize current income to the extent consistent with the preservation of capital and liquidity and � �maintain a stable  per share net asset value �nav� by investing in dollardenominated securities with remaining maturities of  calendar days or less � the investment objective of a portfolio may be changed at any time by the board of trustees of the trust each a �trustee� and collectively the

are the strategies that the portfolios� investment advisor believes are most likely to be important in trying to achieve the portfolios� objectives you should be aware that each portfolio may also use strategies and invest in securities that are not described in this prospectus but that are described in the statement of additional information �sai� � principal investment strategies applicable to each portfolio � each portfolio complies with us securities and exchange commission �sec� regulations that apply to money market funds these regulations require that each portfolio�s investments mature within  days from the date of purchase and that each fund maintain a weighted average maturity of  days or less and a weighted average life of  days or less the portfolios may invest in securities with variable or floating interest rates and securities with demand features the maturities of these securities are determined according to regulations which allow the portfolios to consider some of these securities as having maturities shorter than their stated maturity dates all of the portfolios� investments must be in us dollardenominated high quality securities which have been determined by the portfolios� investment advisor to present minimal credit risk and are rated in one of the two highest rating categories by one or more nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros or are deemed by the investment advisor to be of comparable quality to securities having such ratings in addition no more than  of each portfolio�s total assets may be invested in securities rated in the second highest rating category by an nrsro or deemed to be of comparable quality by the portfolio�s investment advisor at the time of purchase �secondtier securities� with limited exceptions a portfolio may not invest more than  of its total assets in securities issued by the same issuer each portfolio is further limited to investing no more than � of  in secondtier securities of any issuer each portfolio must comply with weekly liquidity standards that require a portfolio to hold at least  of its total assets in cash direct obligations of the us government agency discount notes with remaining maturities of  days or less or securities convertible into cash within five business days each portfolio must also comply with daily liquidity standards that require a portfolio to hold at least  of its total assets in cash direct obligations of the us government or securities convertible into cash within one business day each portfolio is limited to investing no more than  of its total assets in illiquid securities � when selecting securities for each portfolio the portfolio managers first consider general economic factors market conditions and the shortterm interest rate environment in determining what types of shortterm instruments to purchase the portfolio managers then select the specific instruments to be purchased generally the portfolio managers buy and hold securities until their maturities however the portfolio managers may sell securities for a variety of reasons such as to adjust the portfolio�s average maturity credit liquidity or yield metrics � for liquidity and to respond to unusual market conditions the portfolios may hold all or a significant portion of their total assets in cash for temporary defensive purposes this may result in a lower yield and prevent the portfolios from meeting their investment objectives � prime portfolio � the portfolio principally invests in the following highquality us dollardenominated instruments which are further described in the sai �  � � �securities issued or backed by the us government or its agencies or instrumentalities �us government securities� � �instruments of us and foreign banks including certificates of deposit bankers� acceptances and time deposits including eurodollar certificates of deposit �ecds� eurodollar time deposits �etds� and yankee certificates of deposit �ycds� � �corporate debt obligations including commercial paper of us and foreign companies � �money market funds � �municipal securities including variable rate demand notes commercial paper and municipal notes and other shortterm municipal obligations � �debt obligations of foreign governments and foreign government subdivisions and their agencies and instrumentalities and supranational organizations � �repurchase agreements � �loan participation interests � �funding agreements � �assetbacked securities and � �floating and variable rate securities including variable amount master demand notes � the portfolio may invest more than  of its assets in obligations of us banks � government portfolio � the portfolio operates as a �government money market fund� within the meaning of rule a under the  act �rule a� as a government money market fund the portfolio invests exclusively in cash government securities andor repurchase agreements that are collateralized fully � as required by rule d under the  act under normal market conditions the portfolio invests at least  of its net assets plus any borrowings for investment purposes in short term us government securities including repurchase agreements secured by us government securities us government securities are bonds or other debt obligations issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the us government or one of its agencies or instrumentalities us treasury securities and some obligations of us government agencies and instrumentalities are supported by the �full faith and credit� of the us government other us government securities are backed by the right of the issuer to borrow from the us treasury still others are supported only by the credit of the issuer or instrumentality �  � � risk factors � you could lose money by investing in the portfolios although the portfolios seek to preserve the value of your investment at  per share they cannot guarantee they will do so an investment in the portfolios is not a deposit of us bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency the portfolios� sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the portfolios and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the portfolios at any time the principal risks of investing in each portfolio are described below � prime portfolio � prime portfolio is subject to the following principal risks � �the value of your investment might decline if the issuer of an obligation held by the portfolio defaults on the obligation or has its credit rating downgraded � �foreign securities in which the portfolio invests even when us dollar denominated and publicly traded in the united states may involve risks not associated with the securities of domestic issuers political or social instability or diplomatic developments could adversely affect the securities there is also the risk of possible withholding taxes seizure of foreign deposits currency controls interest limitations or other governmental restrictions that might affect the payment of principal or interest on securities owned by the portfolio in addition there may be less public information available about foreign corporations and foreign banks and their branches � �the level of income you receive from the portfolio will be affected by movements in shortterm interest rates � �the value of your investment might decline because of a sharp rise in interest rates that causes the value of the portfolio�s holdings to fall this risk is usually greater for longerterm fixedincome securities conversely when interest rates fall the value of variable and floating rate securities may appreciate less than comparable fixedincome securities effective maturity and effective duration are measures of the portfolio�s interest rate risk � �the portfolio may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner or at a desired price or may be unable to sell the security at all because of a lack of demand in the market for the security or a liquidity provider defaults on its obligation to purchase the security when properly tendered by the portfolio � �the value of municipal securities owned by the portfolio may be adversely affected by future changes in federal income tax laws including rate reductions or the imposition of a flat tax and adverse changes in the financial conditions of municipal securities issuers � �if there are unexpectedly high redemptions of portfolio shares the portfolio might have to sell portfolio securities prior to their maturity possibly at a loss �  � � �if the seller of a repurchase agreement defaults on its obligation to repurchase securities from the portfolio the portfolio may incur costs in disposing of the securities purchased and may experience losses if the proceeds from the sale of the securities are less than the full repurchase price securities purchased by the portfolio under a repurchase agreement may include securities that the portfolio is not otherwise permitted to purchase directly such as longterm government bonds investment and noninvestment grade corporate bonds asset and mortgagebacked securities collateralized mortgage obligations agency real estate mortgage investment conduits and equity securities the value of these securities may be more volatile or less liquid than the securities the portfolio is permitted to purchase directly which increases the risk that the portfolio will be unable to recover fully in the event of the seller�s default � �investments in variable rate demand notes involve credit risk with respect to the issuer or financial institution providing the portfolio with the credit and liquidity support for the unconditional put option while the portfolio invests only in variable rate demand notes of high quality issuers or which are supported by high quality financial institutions it is still possible that an issuer or financial institution could default on its obligations � �an adverse development in the banking industry domestic or foreign may affect the value of the portfolio�s investments more than if the portfolio was not invested to such a degree in the banking industry banks may be particularly susceptible to certain economic factors such as interest rate changes adverse developments in the real estate market fiscal and monetary policy and general economic cycles for example deteriorating economic and business conditions can disproportionately impact companies in the banking industry due to increased defaults on payments by borrowers moreover political and regulatory changes can affect the operations and financial results of companies in the banking industry potentially imposing additional costs and expenses or restricting the types of business activities of these companies � �to the extent the portfolio invests in money market funds advised by another investment advisor you will bear both a proportionate share of the expense in the portfolio and indirectly the expenses of such other money market fund � �in july  the us securities and exchange commission the �sec� adopted reforms to money market fund regulation the compliance periods for these reforms range between july  and october  when the reforms are implemented they could affect the portfolio�s operations and return potential in addition changes to monetary policy by the federal reserve or other regulatory actions could expose fixed income and related markets to heightened volatility interest rate sensitivity and reduced liquidity which may impact the portfolio�s operations universe of potential investment options and return potential � �with the increased use of technologies such as the internet and the dependence on computer systems to perform necessary business functions the portfolio may be subject to operational and informational security risks resulting from breaches in cyber security �cyberattacks� cyberattacks include but are not limited to infection by computer viruses or other malicious software code gaining unauthorized access to systems networks or devices that are used to service the portfolio�s operations through �hacking� or other means for the purpose of misappropriating assets or sensitive information corrupting data or causing operational disruption cyber security failures or breaches by the portfolio�s affiliates or service providers may cause disruptions and impact the business operations potentially resulting in financial losses to both the portfolio and its shareholders the inability of shareholders to transact business inability to calculate the portfolio�s nav impediments to trading violations of applicable privacy and other laws including the release of private shareholder information regulatory fines penalties reputational damage reimbursement or other compensation costs andor additional compliance costs in addition substantial costs may be incurred in order to prevent any cyber incidents in the future while the advisor has risk management systems designed to prevent or reduce the impact of such cyberattacks there are inherent limitations in such controls systems and protocols including the possibility that certain risks have not been identified as well as the rapid development of new threats these cybersecurity risks are also present for issuers of securities in which the portfolio invests which could result in material adverse consequences for such issuers and may cause the portfolio�s investment in such securities to lose value and may result in financial loss for portfolio shareholders �  � � the portfolio is actively managed and its performance therefore will reflect in part usbam�s ability to make investment decisions that are suited to achieving the portfolio�s investment objectives due to its active management the portfolio could underperform other mutual funds with similar investment objectives � government portfolio � government portfolio is subject to the following principal risks � �the value of your investment might decline if the issuer of an obligation held by the portfolio defaults on the obligation or has its credit rating downgraded � �the level of income you receive from the portfolio will be affected by movements in shortterm interest rates because the portfolio invests solely in us government securities and repurchase agreements secured by those securities the portfolio may offer less income than money market funds investing in other highquality money market securities � �the value of your investment might decline because of a sharp rise in interest rates that causes the value of the portfolio�s holdings to fall � �the portfolio may not be able to sell a security in a timely manner or at a desired price or may be unable to sell the security at all because of a lack of demand in the market for the security � �if there are unexpectedly high redemptions of portfolio shares the portfolio might have to sell portfolio securities prior to their maturity possibly at a loss � �if the seller of a repurchase agreement defaults on its obligation to repurchase securities from the portfolio the portfolio may incur costs in disposing of the collateral and may experience losses if there is any delay in its ability to do so � �in july  the sec adopted reforms to money market fund regulation the compliance periods for these reforms range between july  and october  when the amendments are implemented they could affect the portfolio�s operations and return potential in addition changes to monetary policy by the federal reserve or other regulatory actions could expose fixed income and related markets to heightened volatility interest rate sensitivity and reduced liquidity which may impact the portfolio�s operations universe of potential investment options and return potential �  � � the portfolio currently has no intention to rely on the ability to impose redemption gates and liquidity fees which beginning october   will be elective provisions for government money market funds under the sec�s money market fund reforms � �with the increased use of technologies such as the internet and the dependence on computer systems to perform necessary business functions the portfolio may be subject to operational and informational security risks resulting from breaches in cyber security �cyberattacks� cyberattacks include but are not limited to infection by computer viruses or other malicious software code gaining unauthorized access to systems networks or devices that are used to service the portfolio�s operations through �hacking� or other

government portfolio are available for purchase or redemption each day on which the federal reserve bank is open for business except for good friday �business day� all shares of the portfolios are purchased and redeemed at the nav per share of the portfolio next calculated after the purchase or redemption request is communicated to the trust�s transfer agent and determined to be in good order usbam in administering us bank�s securities lending agent duties for a lender will effect all purchases and redemptions on behalf of a lender �  � � the nav of the portfolios will generally be calculated at  pm eastern time on each business day � a portfolio�s nav is equal to the market value of its investments and other assets less any liabilities divided by the number of portfolio shares the securities held by the portfolios are valued on the basis of amortized cost this involves valuing an instrument at its cost and thereafter assuming a constant amortization of any discount or premium until the instrument�s maturity rather than looking at actual changes in the market value of the instrument each portfolio�s nav is normally expected to be  per share � redemptions will be paid in cash unless the board determines that conditions exist that make payment wholly in cash unwise or undesirable if such a determination is made by the board the trust may subject to the requirements of the  act pay redemptions entirely or partially in securities � each portfolio reserves the right to suspend the right of shareholder redemption or postpone the date of payment � �if emergency conditions exist as specified in the  act or as determined by the sec as a result of which disposal of portfolio securities or determination of the nav of the portfolio is not reasonably practicable � �for any period during which trading on the new york stock exchange �nyse� is restricted as determined by the sec or the nyse is closed other than customary weekend and holiday closings � �for any period during which the sec has by rule or regulation deemed that  trading shall be restricted or  an emergency exists or � �for such other periods as the sec may by order permit for the protection of shareholders of the portfolio � in addition in the unlikely event that the board were to determine pursuant to rule a that the extent of the deviation between a portfolio�s amortized cost per share and its marketbased nav per share may result in material dilution or other unfair results to shareholders the board will cause the portfolio to take such action as it deems appropriate to eliminate or reduce to the extent practicable such dilution or unfair results including but not limited to suspending redemption of shares and liquidating the portfolio under rule e of the  act � in accordance with certain federal regulations the trust is required to obtain verify and record information that identifies each entity that applies to open an account for this reason when an account is opened or ownership is changed the trust will request certain information including name address and taxpayer identification number which will be used to verify identity if sufficient information is not available to verify identity the trust will not open an account as required by law the trust may employ various procedures such as comparing information to fraud databases or requesting additional information and documentation to ensure that the information supplied is correct the trust reserves the right to reject any purchase for any reason including failure to provide the trust with information necessary to confirm identity as required by law the board has appointed an antimoney laundering officer who is reelected by the board annually �  � � dividends and distributions � dividends on shares of each portfolio will be declared daily and paid monthly from net investment income the portfolios may take into account capital gains and losses other than net longterm capital gains in their daily dividend declarations dividends will be processed pursuant to the lending agreements between each lender and us bank distributions from net short and longterm capital gains if any will be made at least annually generally distributions will be declared and paid in december if required for a portfolio to avoid imposition of a federal excise tax on undistributed income and capital gains the portfolios do not expect to realize any material longterm capital gains or losses � a shareholder�s right to receive dividends and distributions with respect to shares purchased commences on the effective date of the purchase of such shares and continues through the day immediately preceding the effective date of redemption of such shares � excessive trading of portfolio shares � the board has not adopted market timing policies and procedures applicable to the portfolios the board has evaluated the risks of market timing activities by the portfolios� shareholders and has determined that due to the i portfolios� attempt to maintain a stable nav ii nature of the portfolios� portfolio holdings iii nature of the portfolios� shareholders iv inability of the portfolios� shareholders to exchange into other mutual funds and v inability of the portfolios� shareholders to direct transactions because purchases and redemptions are made as securities are lent and returned it is unlikely that a market timing would be attempted by the portfolios� shareholders or b any attempts to market time the portfolios by shareholders would result in a negative impact to the portfolios or their shareholders � tax consequences � dividends from net investment income and distributions of net shortterm capital gains are taxable to shareholders as ordinary income under federal income tax laws and are not expected to be eligible for the longterm capital gain tax rate applicable to certain qualified dividend income distributions from net longterm capital gains are taxable as longterm capital gains regardless of the length of time a shareholder has held its shares dividends and distributions are taxable whether they are paid in cash or in additional shares � under federal law the income derived from us government securities is exempt from state income taxes and a shareholder may be eligible for this exemption with respect to distributions from the portfolios attributable to income that is so exempt income from repurchase agreements in which the underlying securities are us government securities does not receive this exempt treatment �  � � shareholders will be notified after the end of each calendar year of the amount of income dividends and net capital gains distributed and the percentage of a portfolio�s income attributable to us government securities each portfolio is required to withhold  of reportable payments including dividends capital gain distributions if any and redemptions paid to certain shareholders who have not certified that the social security number or taxpayer identification number supplied by them is correct and that they are not subject to backup withholding because of previous underreporting to the irs these backup withholding requirements generally do not apply to shareholders that are corporations or governmental units or certain tax exempt organizations � the foregoing discussion is only a summary of certain

each a �trustee� and collectively the �board� without shareholder approval to the extent consistent with each portfolio�s investment objective and other stated policies and restrictions and unless otherwise indicated each portfolio may invest in the following instruments and may use the following investment techniques � assetbacked securities prime portfolio may invest in assetbacked securities including assetbacked commercial paper as a principal investment strategy assetbacked securities generally constitute interests in or obligations secured by a pool of receivables other than mortgage loans such as automobile loans and leases credit card receivables home equity loans and trade receivables assetbacked securities generally are issued by a private specialpurpose entity their ratings and creditworthiness typically depend on the legal insulation of the issuer and transaction from the consequences of a sponsoring entity�s bankruptcy as well as on the credit quality of the underlying receivables and the amount and credit quality of any thirdparty credit enhancement supporting the underlying receivables or the assetbacked securities assetbacked securities and their underlying receivables generally are not issued or guaranteed by any governmental entity � commercial paper and rule a securities the securities in which prime portfolio may invest may include commercial paper issued in reliance on the exemption from registration afforded by section  of the securities act of  the � act� and corporate obligations qualifying for resale to certain �qualified institutional buyers� pursuant to rule a under the  act commercial paper refers to shortterm unsecured promissory notes issued by corporations to finance shortterm credit needs commercial paper is usually sold on a discount basis and typically has a maturity at the time of issuance not exceeding nine months prime portfolio may also purchase assetbacked commercial paper �abcp� which is a form of commercial paper that is backed by assets such as real estate trade receivables credit card loans auto loans and other commercial assets abcp is typically sponsored by a commercial bank or other financial institution such securities if they meet the criteria for liquidity established by the board will be considered liquid consequently prime portfolio does not intend to subject such securities to the  limitation applicable to investments in illiquid securities because the secondary market for rule a securities is generally limited to certain qualified institutional buyers there may be times when the trading market for a particular rule a security held by prime portfolio may be limited and will be considered illiquid in such an event us bancorp asset management inc �usbam� will consider appropriate remedies to minimize the effect on prime portfolio�s liquidity �  � � credit enhancement agreements as a nonprincipal investment strategy prime portfolio may separately arrange for guarantees letters of credit or other forms of credit enhancement agreements collectively �guarantees� for the purpose of further securing the payment of principal andor interest on prime portfolio�s investment securities although each investment security at the time it is purchased must meet prime portfolio�s creditworthiness criteria guarantees sometimes are purchased from banks and other institutions collectively �guarantors� when usbam prime portfolio�s investment advisor through yield and credit analysis deems that credit enhancement of certain securities is advisable � foreign securities prime portfolio may invest as a principal investment strategy in dollardenominated obligations of us branches of foreign banks foreign branches of domestic banks foreign banks and foreign corporations investment in foreign securities is subject to special investment risks that differ in some respects from those related to investments in securities of us domestic issuers these risks include political social or economic instability in the country of the issuer the difficulty of predicting international trade patterns the possibility of the imposition of exchange controls expropriation limits on removal of currency or other assets nationalization of assets foreign withholding and other taxation and foreign trading practices including higher trading commissions custodial charges and delayed settlements foreign securities also may be subject to greater fluctuations in price than securities issued by us corporations the principal markets on which these securities trade may have less volume and liquidity and may be more volatile than securities markets in the united states � in addition there may be less publicly available information about a foreign bank or company than about a us domiciled bank or company foreign banks and companies generally are not subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards comparable to those applicable to us domestic banks and companies there is also generally less government regulation of securities exchanges brokers and listed companies abroad than in the united states confiscatory taxation or diplomatic developments could also affect investment in those countries various provisions of federal law governing the establishment and operation of domestic branches of foreign banks do not apply to foreign branches of domestic banks obligations of us branches of foreign banks may be general obligations of the parent bank in addition to the issuing branch or may be limited by the terms of a specific obligation and by federal and state regulation as well as by governmental action in the country in which the foreign bank has its head office � funding agreements prime portfolio may invest in funding agreements as a principal investment strategy funding agreements are contracts issued by insurance companies that guarantee a return of principal plus some amount of interest funding agreements purchased by prime portfolio will typically be shortterm and provide an adjustable rate of interest funding agreements may or may not allow prime portfolio to demand repayment of principal after an agreed upon waiting period or upon certain other conditions the insurance company may also have a corresponding right to prepay the principal with accrued interest upon a specified number of days� notice to prime portfolio the maturity date of some funding agreements may be extended upon the mutual agreement and consent of the insurance company and prime portfolio generally there is no active secondary market in shortterm funding agreements consequently shortterm funding agreements may be considered by prime portfolio to be illiquid investments and therefore subject to the rule a of the  act �rule a� limitations on investing in illiquid securities �  � � illiquid securities neither portfolio will invest more than  of its net assets in illiquid securities or securities that are not readily marketable including repurchase agreements and time deposits of more than seven days� duration the absence of a regular trading market for securities imposes additional risks on investments in these securities illiquid securities may be difficult to value and may often be disposed of only after considerable expense and delay � letters of credit certain of the debt obligations including certificates of participation variable rate demand notes commercial paper and other shortterm obligations which prime portfolio may purchase may be backed by an unconditional and irrevocable letter of credit or other form of credit or liquidity support of a bank savings and loan association or insurance company which assumes the obligation for payment and interest in the event of default by the issuer only banks savings and loan associations and insurance companies which in the opinion of usbam are of comparable quality to issuers of other permitted investments of prime portfolio may be used for letter of creditbacked investments � loan participation interests prime portfolio may invest in loan participation interests as a principal investment strategy a loan participation interest represents a pro rata undivided interest in an underlying bank loan participation interests like the underlying loans may have fixed floating or variable rates of interest the bank selling a participation interest generally acts as a mere conduit between its borrower and the purchasers of interests in the loan the purchaser of an interest for example prime portfolio generally does not have recourse against the bank in the event of a default on the underlying loan therefore the credit risk associated with such instruments is governed by the creditworthiness of the underlying borrowers and not by the banks selling the interests if prime portfolio invests in loan participation interests that can be sold within a sevenday period the interests are deemed by usbam to be liquid investments if prime portfolio invests in loan participation interests that are restricted from being sold within a sevenday period the interests are deemed by usbam to be illiquid investments and are therefore subject to the rule a limitations on investing in illiquid securities � money market funds each of the portfolios may invest to the extent permitted by the  act in securities issued by other money market funds provided that the permitted investments of such other money market funds constitute permitted investments of the investing portfolio as a shareholder of another investment company a portfolio would bear along with other shareholders its pro rata portion of that company�s expenses including advisory fees these expenses would be in addition to the expenses that the portfolio bears directly in connection with its own operations investment companies in which the portfolios may invest may also impose a sales or distribution charge in connection with the purchase or redemption of their shares and other types of commissions or charges such charges will be payable by the portfolios and therefore will be borne indirectly by its shareholders �  � � municipal securities prime portfolio may invest in municipal securities as a principal investment strategy municipal securities include municipal bonds and other debt securities issued by the states and by their local and specialpurpose political subdivisions the term �municipal bond� as used in this section includes shortterm municipal notes and other commercial paper issued by the states and their political subdivisions two general classifications of municipal bonds are �general obligation� bonds and �revenue� bonds general obligation bonds are secured by the governmental issuer�s pledge of its faith credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest upon a default by the issuer of its principal and interest payment obligation they are usually paid from general revenues of the issuing governmental entity revenue bonds on the other hand are usually payable only out of a specific revenue source rather than from general revenues revenue bonds ordinarily are not backed by the faith credit or general taxing power of the issuing governmental entity the principal and interest on revenue bonds for private facilities are typically paid solely out of rents or other specified payments made to the issuing governmental entity by a private company which uses or operates the facilities examples of these types of obligations are industrial revenue bonds and pollution control revenue bonds industrial revenue bonds are issued by governmental entities to provide financing aid to community facilities such as hospitals hotels business or residential complexes convention halls and sport complexes pollution control revenue bonds are issued to finance air water and solids pollution control systems for privately operated industrial or commercial facilities revenue bonds which are not backed by the credit of the issuing governmental entity frequently provide a higher rate of return than other municipal obligations but they entail greater risk than obligations which are guaranteed by a governmental unit with taxing power federal income tax laws place substantial limitations on industrial revenue bonds and particularly certain specified private activity bonds issued after august   in the future legislation could be introduced in congress which could further restrict or eliminate the income tax exemption for interest on debt obligations in which prime portfolio may invest � prime portfolio�s investments in municipal bonds and other debt obligations that are purchased from financial institutions such as commercial and investment banks savings associations and insurance companies may take the form of participations beneficial interests in a trust partnership interests or any other form of indirect ownership that allows prime portfolio to treat the income from the investment as exempt from federal income tax � in addition prime portfolio may invest in other federal income taxfree securities such as i tax anticipation notes �tans� and revenue anticipation notes �rans� issued to finance working capital needs in anticipation of receiving taxes or other revenues ii bond anticipation notes �bans� that are intended to be refinanced through a later issuance of longerterm bonds iii variable and floating rate obligations including variable rate demand notes described below under ��variable and floating rate instruments� iv tender option bonds and v participation trust and partnership interests in any of the foregoing obligations the obligations of tans rans and bans are generally secured by the anticipated revenues from taxes grants or bond financing an investment in such instruments however presents a risk that the anticipated revenues will not be received or that such revenues will be insufficient to satisfy the issuer�s payment obligations under the notes or that refinancing will be otherwise unavailable tender option bonds are created when municipal instruments are transferred to a special purpose trust which issues two classes of certificates the first class commonly called floating rate certificates pays an interest rate that is typically reset weekly based on a specified index the second class commonly called inverse floaters pays an interest rate based on the difference between the interest rate earned on the underlying municipal instruments and the interest rate paid on the floating rate certificates after expenses in selecting tender option bonds usbam may consider the creditworthiness of the issuer of the underlying bond deposited in the trust the experience of the custodian and the quality of the sponsor providing the tender option among other factors in certain instances the tender option may be terminated �  � � obligations of banks and other financial services companies prime portfolio invests as a principal investment strategy in us dollardenominated obligations of domestic and foreign banks including fixed and variable rate certificates of deposit time deposits bankers� acceptances and other shortterm obligations certificates of deposit are negotiable certificates evidencing the obligation of a bank to repay funds deposited with it for a specified period of time time deposits are nonnegotiable deposits maintained in a banking institution for a specified period of time at a stated interest rate time deposits that may be held by prime portfolio will not benefit from insurance from the deposit insurance fund administered by the federal deposit insurance corporation bankers� acceptances are credit instruments evidencing the obligation of a bank to pay a draft drawn on it by a customer these instruments reflect the obligation both of the bank and of the drawer to pay the face amount of the instrument upon maturity bank obligations in which prime portfolio invests may include uninsured direct obligations bearing fixed floating or variable interest rates prime portfolio may also invest in securities issued by other financial services companies in various industries as a principal investment strategy to the extent prime portfolio invests in securities issued by domestic and foreign banks and other financial services companies prime portfolio�s performance will be susceptible to the risks associated with the banking and financial services sectors these sectors are highly dependent on the supply of shortterm financing the value of securities of issuers in the banking and financial services sectors can be sensitive to changes in government regulation and interest rates and to economic downturns in the united states and abroad � put options prime portfolio may as a nonprincipal investment strategy purchase securities that provide for the right to resell them to the issuer a bank or a brokerdealer at a specified price within a specified period of time prior to the maturity date of such obligations such a right to resell which is commonly known as a �put� may be sold transferred or assigned only with the underlying security or securities prime portfolio may pay a higher price for a security with a put than would be paid for the same security without a put the primary purpose of purchasing such securities with puts is to permit prime portfolio to be as fully invested as practicable in securities while at the same time providing prime portfolio with appropriate liquidity � repurchase agreements each portfolio may engage in repurchase agreements as a principal investment strategy a repurchase agreement involves the purchase by the portfolio of securities with the agreement that after a stated period of time the original seller the �counterparty� will buy back the same securities �collateral� at a predetermined price or yield repurchase agreements permit a portfolio to maintain liquidity and earn income over periods of time as short as overnight a portfolio may engage in repurchase agreements with any member bank of the federal reserve system or dealer in us government securities a portfolio may enter into repurchase agreement transactions that are collateralized fully as defined in rule bc of the  act which has the effect of enabling the portfolio to look to the collateral rather than the counterparty for determining whether its assets are �diversified� for  act purposes in addition collateral may include securities that the portfolio is not otherwise permitted to purchase directly such as longterm government bonds and for prime portfolio investment grade corporate bonds and equity securities irrespective of the type of collateral underlying a repurchase agreement the portfolio must determine that a repurchase obligation with a particular counterparty involves minimal credit risk to the portfolio and otherwise satisfies the credit quality standards applicable to the acquisition of an instrument issued by such counterparty in compliance with rule a � securities pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements are held by the custodian bank until the respective agreements mature the portfolios may also invest in triparty repurchase agreements securities held as collateral for triparty repurchase agreements are maintained in a segregated account by an unaffiliated thirdparty custodian bank until the maturity of the repurchase agreement the market value of the collateral underlying the repurchase agreement will be determined on each business day if at any time the market value of the collateral falls below the repurchase price under the repurchase agreement including any accrued interest the appropriate portfolio will promptly receive additional collateral so the total collateral is an amount at least equal to the repurchase price plus accrued interest �  � � repurchase agreements involve certain risks not associated with direct investments in securities if the counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase as a result of its bankruptcy or otherwise the portfolio will seek to sell the collateral which could involve costs or delays although collateral will at all times be maintained in an amount at least equal to the repurchase price under the agreement including accrued interest the portfolio would suffer a loss if the proceeds from the sale of the collateral were less than the agreedupon repurchase price as noted above the portfolios may engage in repurchase agreement transactions that are collateralized by securities that the portfolios are not otherwise directly permitted to purchase such as longterm government bonds and for prime portfolio investment grade corporate bonds and equity securities these collateral securities may be less liquid or more volatile than others or less liquid and more volatile than the securities that the portfolio is permitted to purchase directly thereby increasing the risk that the portfolio will be unable to recover fully in the event of a counterparty�s default and potentially resulting in the portfolio owning securities that it is not otherwise permitted to purchase usbam will monitor the creditworthiness of the firms with which the portfolio enters into repurchase agreements � us government securities the portfolios may invest in securities issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the us government or agencies or instrumentalities of the us government making such investments is a principal investment strategy for the portfolios these investments include direct obligations of the us treasury such as us treasury bonds notes and bills these treasury securities are essentially the same except for differences in interest rates maturities and dates of issuance in addition to treasury securities the portfolios may invest in securities such as notes bonds and discount notes which are issued or guaranteed by agencies of the us government and various instrumentalities which have been established or sponsored by the us government except for us treasury securities these us government obligations even those which are guaranteed by federal agencies or instrumentalities may or may not be backed by the �full faith and credit� of the united states in the case of securities not backed by the full faith and credit of the united states the investor must look principally to the agency issuing or guaranteeing the obligation for ultimate repayment and may not be able to assert a claim against the united states itself in the event the agency or instrumentality does not meet its commitment usbam considers securities guaranteed by an irrevocable letter of credit issued by a government agency to be guaranteed by that agency � us treasury obligations include bills notes and bonds issued by the us treasury and separately traded interest and principal component parts of such obligations that are transferable through the federal bookentry system which are known as separately traded registered interest and principal securities �strips� strips are sold as zero coupon securities which means that they are sold at a substantial discount and redeemed at face value at their maturity date without interim cash payments of interest or principal this discount is accreted over the life of the security and such accretion will constitute the income earned on the security for both accounting and tax purposes because of these features such securities may be subject to greater interest rate volatility than interest paying us treasury obligations the portfolios� investments in strips will be limited to components with maturities less than or equal to  days and the portfolios will not actively trade such components �  � �� variable and floating rate instruments a floating rate security provides for the automatic adjustment of its interest rate whenever a specified interest rate changes a variable rate security provides for the automatic establishment of a new interest rate on set dates interest rates on these securities are ordinarily tied to and represent a percentage of a widely recognized interest rate such as the yield on day us treasury bills or the prime rate of a specified bank these rates may change as often as twice daily generally changes in interest rates will have a smaller effect on the market value of variable and floating rate securities than on the market value of comparable fixedincome obligations thus investing in variable and floating rate securities generally affords less opportunity for capital appreciation and depreciation than investing in comparable fixedincome securities the portfolios may purchase variable and floating rate nonus government securities that have a stated maturity in excess of  calendar days only if the portfolios have a right to demand payment of the principal of the instrument at least once every  calendar days upon not more than  days� notice � variable and floating rate instruments may include variable amount master demand notes that permit the indebtedness thereunder to vary in addition to providing for periodic adjustments in the interest rate there may be no active secondary market with respect to a particular variable or floating rate instrument nevertheless the periodic readjustments of their interest rates tend to assure that their value to a portfolio will approximate their par value illiquid variable and floating rate instruments instruments that are not payable upon seven days� notice and do not have an active trading market that are acquired by a portfolio are subject to a portfolio�s percentage limitations regarding securities that are illiquid or not readily marketable usbam will continuously monitor the creditworthiness of issuers of variable and floating rate instruments in which the trust invests and the ability of issuers to repay principal and interest � whenissued transactions the portfolios may purchase securities on a whenissued basis although they do not do so as a principal investment strategy new issues of securities are often offered on a whenissued basis this means that delivery and payment for the securities normally will take place several days after the date the buyer commits to purchase them the payment obligation and the interest rate that will be received on securities purchased on a whenissued basis are each fixed at the time the buyer enters into the commitment � each portfolio will make commitments to purchase whenissued securities only with the intention of actually acquiring the securities but a portfolio may sell these securities or dispose of the commitment before the settlement date if it is deemed advisable as a matter of investment strategy cash or marketable highquality debt securities equal to the amount of the above commitments will be segregated on each portfolio�s records for the purpose of determining the adequacy of these securities the segregated securities will be valued at market value if the market value of such securities declines additional cash or securities will be segregated on a portfolio�s records on a daily basis so that the market value of the account will equal the amount of such commitments by that portfolio no portfolio will invest more than  of its net assets in whenissued securities � securities purchased on a whenissued basis and the securities held by each portfolio are subject to changes in market value based upon the public�s perception of changes in the level of interest rates generally the value of such securities will fluctuate inversely to changes in interest rates ie they will appreciate in value when interest rates decline and decrease in value when interest rates rise therefore if in order to achieve higher interest income a portfolio remains substantially fully invested at the same time that it has purchased securities on a �whenissued� basis there will be a greater possibility of fluctuation in the portfolio�s net asset value �nav� �  � � when payment for whenissued securities is due each portfolio will meet its obligations from thenavailable cash flow the sale of segregated securities the sale of other securities or and although it would not normally be expected to do so from the sale of the whenissued securities themselves which may have a market value greater or less than the portfolio�s payment obligation the sale of securities to meet such obligations carries with it a greater potential for the realization of capital gains which are subject to federal income taxes � zerocoupon and stepup coupon securities the portfolios may invest in zerocoupon securities and prime portfolio may invest in stepup coupon securities as nonprincipal investment strategies these securities are debt securities that do not make regular cash interest payments zerocoupon securities are securities that make no periodic interest payments but are instead sold at discounts from face value stepup coupon bonds are debt securities that may not pay interest for a specified period of time and then after the initial period may pay interest at a series of different rates if these securities do not pay current cash income the market prices of these securities would generally be more volatile and likely to respond to a greater degree to changes in interest rates than the market prices of securities having similar maturities and credit qualities that pay cash interest periodically � money market fund material events � on january   us bancorp made a capital contribution to prime portfolio in the amount of  million the contribution was made by us bancorp in order to offset prime portfolio�s historical capital losses us bancorp is the indirect parent of usbam � prime portfolio was required to disclose additional information about this event on form ncr and to file this form with the us securities and exchange commission the �sec� any form ncr filing submitted by prime portfolio is available on the edgar database on the sec�s internet site at httpwwwsecgov � investment restrictions � fundamental investment restrictions � each portfolio is classified under the  act as a diversified series of an openend management investment company this classification cannot be changed with respect to a portfolio without approval by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the portfolio as defined in the  act ie by the lesser of the vote of a� of the shares of the portfolio present at a meeting where more than  of the outstanding shares are present in person or by proxy or b�more than  of the outstanding shares of the portfolio the  act currently restricts a portfolio with respect to  of its total assets from purchasing securities of an issuer other than i securities issued by other investment companies ii securities issued by the us government its agencies instrumentalities or authorities or iii repurchase agreements fully collateralized by us government securities if a such purchase would at the time cause more than  of the portfolio�s total assets taken at market value to be invested in the securities of such issuer or b such purchase would at the time result in more than  of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer being held by the portfolio �  � � in addition to the investment objective and strategies and risk factors set forth in part a prime portfolio and government portfolio are subject to the investment restrictions set forth below the investment restrictions set forth in paragraphs� through  below are fundamental and cannot be changed with respect to a portfolio without approval by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the portfolio as defined in the  act � neither portfolio will � concentrate its investments in a particular industry except that there shall be no limitation on the purchase of obligations of domestic commercial banks excluding for this purpose foreign branches of domestic commercial banks for purposes of this limitation the us government and state or municipal governments and their political subdivisions are not considered members of any industry whether a portfolio is concentrating in an industry shall be determined in accordance with the  act as interpreted or modified from time to time by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction � borrow money or issue senior securities except as permitted under the  act as interpreted or modified from time to time by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction � purchase physical commodities or contracts relating to physical commodities � purchase or sell real estate unless as a result of ownership of securities or other instruments but this shall not prevent the portfolios from investing in securities or other instruments backed by real estate or interests therein or in securities of companies that deal in real estate or mortgages � act as an underwriter of securities of other issuers except to the extent that in connection with the disposition of portfolio securities it may be deemed an underwriter under applicable laws � make loans except as permitted under the  act as interpreted or modified from time to time by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction � for purposes of applying the limitation set forth in number  above according to the current interpretation by the sec a portfolio would be concentrated in an industry if  or more of its total assets based on current market value at the time of purchase were invested in that industry � for purposes of applying the limitation set forth in number  above under the  act as currently in effect a portfolio is not permitted to issue senior securities except that the portfolio may borrow from any bank if immediately after such borrowing the value of such portfolio�s total assets is at least  of the principal amount of all of the portfolio�s borrowings ie the principal amount of the borrowings may not exceed   of the portfolio�s total assets in the event that such asset coverage shall at any time fall below  the portfolio shall within three days thereafter not including sundays and holidays reduce the amount of its borrowings to an extent that the asset coverage of such borrowings shall be at least  �  � � for purposes of applying the limitation set forth in number  above there are no limitations with respect to unsecured loans made by the portfolio to an unaffiliated party however if the portfolio loans its portfolio securities the obligation on the part of the portfolio to return collateral upon termination of the loan could be deemed to involve the issuance of a senior security within the meaning of section f of the  act in order to avoid violation of section f the portfolio may not make a loan of portfolio securities if as a result more than onethird of its total asset value at market value computed at the time of making a loan would be on loan the portfolio currently does not intend to make loans unsecured or otherwise except to the extent that investments in debt securities in accordance with rule a as discussed below under �additional restrictions� would be deemed to be loans � nonfundamental investment restrictions � the following restrictions are nonfundamental and may be changed by the board without a shareholder vote � the portfolios will not sell securities short � the portfolios will not borrow money in an amount exceeding  of a portfolio�s total assets the portfolio will not borrow money for leverage purposes for the purpose of this investment restriction the purchase of securities on a whenissued or delayed delivery basis shall not be deemed the borrowing of money the portfolio will not make additional investments while its borrowings exceed  of total assets � additional restrictions � the portfolios may not invest in obligations of any affiliate of us bancorp including us bank national association �us bank� � the trust may rely on a previously received exemptive order investment company act release no  dated march   from the sec under which shortterm investments and repurchase agreements may be entered into on a joint basis by the portfolios and other funds advised by usbam � the trust may rely on a previously received exemptive order investment company act release no  dated april   from the sec which permits the portfolios to participate in an interfund lending program pursuant to which the portfolios and other mutual funds advised by usbam may lend money directly to each other for emergency or temporary purposes the program is subject to a number of conditions designed to ensure fair and equitable treatment of all participating mutual funds including the following  no mutual fund may borrow money through the program unless it receives a more favorable interest rate than a rate approximating the lowest interest rate at which bank loans would be available to any of the participating mutual funds under a loan agreement and  no mutual fund may lend money through the program unless it receives a more favorable return than that available from an investment in repurchase agreements and to the extent applicable money market cash sweep arrangements in addition a mutual fund may participate in the program only if and to the extent that such participation is consistent with the fund�s investment objectives and policies for instance money market funds would normally participate only as lenders because they rarely need to borrow cash to meet redemptions the duration of any loans made under the interfund lending program will be limited to the time required to receive payment for the securities sold but in no event more than seven days all loans will be callable by the lending fund on one business day�s notice a mutual fund may have to borrow from a bank at a higher interest rate if an interfund loan is called or not renewed any delay in repayment to a lending fund could result in a lost investment opportunity or additional costs the program is subject to the oversight and periodic review of the board of trustees of the participating mutual funds or the equivalent �  � � the portfolios are subject to the investment restrictions of rule a in addition to other policies and restrictions discussed herein a description of the ratings categories used to determine whether a security is an �eligible security� as that term is defined in rule a is included in appendix a � the concentration policy of prime portfolio permits investment without limit in bankers� acceptances certificates of deposit and similar instruments issued by i us banks and ii us branches of foreign banks in circumstances in which the us branches of foreign banks are subject to the same regulation as us banks prime portfolio may concentrate in such instruments when in the opinion of usbam the yield marketability and availability of investments meeting prime portfolio�s quality standards in the banking industry justify any additional risks associated with the concentration of prime portfolio�s assets in such industry � portfolio turnover � each portfolio generally intends to hold its portfolio securities to maturity in certain instances however a portfolio may dispose of its portfolio securities prior to maturity when it appears such action will be in the best interest of the portfolio because of changing money market conditions redemption requests or otherwise each portfolio may attempt to maximize the total return on its portfolio by trading to take advantage of changing money market conditions and trends or to take advantage of what are believed to be disparities in yield relationships between different money market instruments because each portfolio invests in shortterm securities and manages its portfolio as described above in �description of the trust and its investments and risks � investment policies� and in part a to the trust�s registration statement the portfolio will turn over several times a year because brokerage commissions as such are not usually paid in connection with the purchase or sale of the securities in which the portfolio invests and because the transactional costs are small the high turnover is not expected to materially affect navs or yields securities with maturities of less than one year are excluded from required portfolio turnover rate calculations and therefore the portfolios� turnover rate for reporting purposes will be zero � disclosure of portfolio holdings � the portfolios are not subject to the policies and procedures adopted by the board which prohibit the release of information concerning portfolio holdings �disclosure policies� because the portfolios� shares are not available to the general public ie shares are only offered in connection with the investment of collateral received in connection with securities lending and the portfolios hold only shortterm securities that generally do not vary significantly in value over short periods of time because of the types of securities held by the portfolios such portfolio holdings information would not be subject to the types of misuses that the disclosure policies are designed to prevent �  � � information concerning the portfolios� securities holdings as well as their weighted average maturity and weighted average life will be posted on the us bank institutional trust and custody website five business days after the end of the month and will remain posted on the website for at least six months thereafter in addition the portfolios file more detailed holdings information with the sec on form nmfp no later than five business days after the end of the month which becomes publicly available on the sec�s website  days after the end of

portfolios the actual daytoday risk management with respect to the portfolios or the trust resides with usbam and the other service providers to the portfolios or the trust in line with the board�s oversight responsibility the board receives reports and makes inquiries at its regular meetings or otherwise regarding various risks however the board relies upon the trust�s chief compliance officer who reports directly to the board and usbam including its senior business unit risk manager and other members of its management team to assist the board in identifying and understanding the nature and extent of such risks and determining whether and to what extent such risks may be eliminated or mitigated although the risk management policies of usbam and the other service providers are designed to be effective those policies and their implementation vary among service providers and over time and there is no guarantee that they will be effective not all risks that may affect the portfolios or

or will become knowledgeable regarding the trust�s business and service provider arrangements in addition each trustee other than messrs baumgardner and gaumond has served for a number of years as a director of other funds in the fund complex as indicated in the �independent trustees� table above among the factors the board considered when concluding that an individual should serve on the board

prior experience if any serving on the boards of public companies and other complex enterprises and organizations and iv how the individual�s skills experiences and attributes would contribute to an

portfolios providing audit services including audits of the annual financial statements �� item  portfolio managers � the portfolios are managed by a team of persons who are employed by usbam �  � � item  brokerage allocation and other practices � the trust�s portfolios are almost exclusively composed of fixed income securities and most of the portfolios� portfolio transactions are made directly with the issuer of the securities or with brokerdealers acting for their own account or as agents the portfolios do not usually pay brokerage commissions on purchases and sales of fixed income securities although the price of the securities generally includes compensation in the form of a spread or markup or markdown which is not disclosed separately � usbam determines the brokerdealers with or through which the portfolios� securities transactions are executed the primary consideration in placing a portfolio transaction with a particular brokerdealer is efficiency in executing orders and obtaining the most favorable net prices for the portfolios under the circumstances of each particular transaction more specifically the portfolios consider the full range and quality of the services offered by a brokerdealer the determination may include the competitiveness of price access to desirable securities willingness and ability to execute difficult or large transactions value nature and quality of any brokerage and research products and services provided financial responsibility including willingness to commit capital of the brokerdealer ability to minimize market impact maintenance of the confidentiality of orders responsiveness of the brokerdealer to usbam and ability to settle trades for transactions where competitiveness of price is the determining factor all other factors being equal usbam will seek to obtain more than one offer or bid on purchases and sales of securities to the extent they are available usbam may however select a dealer to effect a particular transaction without communicating with all dealers who might be able to effect such transaction because of the volatility of the market and usbam�s desire to accept a particular price for a security because the price offered by the dealer meets usbam�s guidelines for profit yield or both while it is usbam�s policy to seek the most advantageous price on each transaction there is no assurance it will be successful in doing so on every transaction � when consistent with the best execution objectives described above business may be placed with brokerdealers who furnish brokerage and research products and services to usbam such brokerage and research products and services would include advice both directly and in writing as to the value of securities the advisability of investing in purchasing or selling securities and the availability of securities or purchasers or sellers of securities as well as analyses and reports concerning issues industries securities economic factors and trends and portfolio strategy the research products and services may allow usbam to supplement its own investment research activities and enable it to obtain the views and information of individuals and research staffs of many different securities firms prior to making investment decisions for the portfolios to the extent portfolio transactions are effected with brokerdealers who furnish research services usbam would receive a benefit which is not capable of evaluation in dollar amounts without providing any direct monetary benefit to the portfolios from these transactions as a general matter the brokerage and research products and services that usbam receives from brokerdealers are used to service all of usbam�s accounts however any particular brokerage and research product or service may not be used to service each and every account and may not benefit the particular accounts that generated the transactions that may have resulted in the receipt of the product or service �  � � usbam has not entered into any formal or informal agreements with any brokerdealers and does not maintain any �formula� that must be followed in connection with the placement of the portfolios� portfolio transactions in exchange for brokerage and research products and services provided to usbam usbam may from time to time maintain an informal list of brokerdealers that will be used as a general guide in the placement of portfolio business in order to encourage certain brokerdealers to provide usbam with brokerage and research products and services which usbam anticipates will be useful to it any list if maintained would be merely a general guide which would be used only after the primary criteria for the selection of brokerdealers discussed above has been met and accordingly substantial deviations from the list could occur while it is not expected that the portfolios will pay brokerage commissions if they do usbam would authorize the portfolios to pay an amount of commission for effecting a securities transaction in excess of the amount of commission another brokerdealer would have charged only if usbam determined in good faith that such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such brokerdealer viewed in terms of either that particular transaction or usbam�s overall responsibilities with respect to the portfolio � generally usbam does not aggregate or �bunch� fixed income securities orders usbam may however bunch orders in the same fixed income securities for all accounts provided that no account is favored over any other participating account in an effort to obtain best execution at the best price available any subsequent order for the same security is treated as a separate order which may be aggregated with remaining unfilled orders for the same security in some cases this system could have a detrimental effect on the price or volume of the security as far as each account is concerned in other cases however the ability of the accounts to participate in volume transactions will produce better executions for each account it is usbam�s policy to allocate investment opportunities among all accounts in a fair and equitable manner that does not systematically favor one account over any other by providing buy and sell opportunities to all accounts orders for fixed income securities will be allocated across participating accounts using one of three approved allocation methods pro rata allocation pro rata excluding accounts for which transaction and processing costs would exceed the expected benefit of the trade and the good faith judgment method selection of the allocation method will consider one or more of the following factors � �nature of the security to be allocated �current holdings in the issuer �size of the available position �current duration �current credit score shortterm fixed income portfolios only �minimizing operational and trading risk �account investment policies restrictions and constraints �account liquidity needs �availability of cash and �any other information usbam considers relevant � neither portfolio effects brokerage transactions in its portfolio securities with any brokerdealer affiliated directly or indirectly with usbam unless such transactions including the frequency thereof the receipt of commissions payable in connection therewith and the selection of the affiliated brokerdealer effecting such transactions are not unfair or unreasonable to the shareholders of the portfolio as determined by the board any transactions with an affiliated brokerdealer must be on terms that are both at least as favorable to the portfolio as such portfolio can obtain elsewhere and at least as favorable as such affiliated brokerdealer normally gives to others �  � � government portfolio paid no brokerage fees as of december   as it was not in yet in operation during its three most recent
