posted by crefc in autumn  ≈ leave a comment tagsagency cmbs fannie mae gse insurance mortgage municipal property regulatory securities securitization at numerous conferences this year including the commercial real estate finance council crefc annual conference in new york one particular topic has remained at the forefront global capital requirements which have the potential to become impediments

key driver of investment demand and liquidity in the coming years versus any typical collateral analysis investors currently consider of particular investor focus recently are various regulators’ evaluations of what actually constitute “highquality” liquid assets in order to calculate the basel iii liquidity coverage ratio and the associated market value haircuts this topic has transcended

other countries as a result there is still uncertainty as to what final standards may emerge for global institutional investors as rules will likely be further adjusted what are the lcr and hqla as

calendarday stress period the ratio has total hqla as the numerator and net cash outflows as the denominator each nation has divided potential hqla into three levels  a and b with increasing market

general caps on the total percentage of assets and certain types of assets that can be held under the general regulations most level  assets may be included with no haircut level  assets receive a

recognize the credit quality and liquidity that comes from their governmentsponsored guarantee on their canada mortgage and housing corp cmhc residential mortgage bonds as level  assets while us agency mbs is classified as level a under the us rules based on our conversations with institutional investors most are surprised and concerned about that decision there are over  trillion in agency mbs outstanding including in collateralized mortgage obligations cmos making it the thirdlargest bond class available to investors us treasuries and us corporates are the two largest also average daily trading volume suggests that agency mbs is the secondmosttraded fixedincome product after treasuries and has been for at least the past  years it is understandable that us regulators may want to distinguish between an implied and fullfaithandcredit guarantee by the government but there may be an unintentional effect on the global bond ecosystem if investors begin to trade out of the  trillion agency bond market en masse and into the limited number of other potential alternatives which would be the  trillion us treasury market or the less liquid but still large  trillion corporate bond market this is especially true for domestic bank investors who are currently the  holder of agencygsebacked securities and have increased their holdings since  see appendix beyond the issue of deciding what is liquid and highquality there are valuation haircuts that are applied to hqla although generally not to level  on this issue the eu regulations apply a  haircut to their qualifying rmbsabs securitizations this is below the  haircut for some other b hqla suggesting that the eu regulators may be recognizing that securitized products can help support their financial institutions and play a role in funding economic growth while not yet fully implemented these levels which include some bond products and exclude others are already becoming a key factor in influencing bank investment demand as opposed to assessing credit risk and liquidity relative to yield based on conversations with institutional investors a covered bank may invest in an eu sme loan abs or auto loan deal versus a us collateralized loan obligation clo or auto loan deal based solely on the preferential regulatory treatment further it appears that commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs are excluded in all jurisdictions from qualifying as hqla this exclusion is likely playing a role in the limited reemergence of floatingrate shorterduration cmbs as that market has not seen the same recovery achieved in fixedrate cmbs in europe cmbs does not meet several of the  criteria recommended by the bcbsiosco task force to be classified as a “simple transparent and comparable” securitization these include nature of the assets assets backing cmbs transactions typically are heterogeneous not homogenous consistency of underwriting cmbs underwriting standards can and sometimes will vary by loan circumstance eg acquisition or refinancing stabilized versus nonstabilized property and redemption cash flows the majority of principal cash flows in most cmbs depend on refinancing or sale of the assets at maturity in addition cmbs do not meet other “highquality” securitization hqs guidelines published by the eu banking authority see endnote which include a credit risk criterion that limits maximum obligor exposure to  we suspect that some of these parameters may be due to poor performance that came from some more transitional floatingrate cmbs pools which usually contain three to  transitional properties the  restriction may unnecessarily restrict the market from utilizing products such as singleborrower cmbs which was the first type of us cmbs deal to reemerge after the financial crisis and currently remains a significant portion of the us market about  of  issuance year to date through july so it is somewhat ironic that the transparency achieved in singleloan cmbs is excluded by regulatory rules that take comfort in diverse abs pools average daily trading volumes how is liquidity being measured any comprehensive measure of market liquidity requires many variables such as bidasked spreads spread volatility total outstandings the ability to transact in times of market stress such as right after the financial crisis trading volumes etc unfortunately all of those variables are not publicly available  which creates a challenge for regulators to analyze and implement a national classification system consistent with other different international markets in charts  and  we compiled average daily trading volumes for various fixedincome products chart  – us average daily trading volume of munis corporates and agency mbs  ytd chart  shows that agency mbs is the most liquid bond product traded in the us by a wide margin except for treasuries this explains investors’ concerns that it is classified as level a and haircut at  while bidasked spreads for corporate and municipal bonds are also consistently quoted by many market makers the volumes are nowhere near the magnitude that can be traded in the agency market chart  – us average structured finance daily trading volumes q q  because of the limited overall liquidity during the  crisis many investors turned to other securitized bonds products such as cmbs as many market makers were still able to transact among accounts in large amounts in these products albeit at wider spreads for cmbs this created a record of widening historical price transaction levels but given the volumes involved that record actually indicates that liquidity was available in a functioning marketplace looking at the available data since  see chart  cmbs clearly remains one of the more actively traded and liquid structured finance bond sectors with average trade volumes usually exceeding  billion on a daily basis the shorter duration abs products such as credit cards or autos have very low trading volumes because those investors usually buy to hold for the two or threeyear term and so market makers may be less prepared to make markets in those bond classes as a result and because of their shorter terms these bonds are less likely to see price distortion the question still exists as to whether these assets are as liquid as a supersenior cmbs class that did see bids during crisis conditions the overall high trade volumes for cmbs are likely to come mostly from the highestrated classes as many investors use those classes as a swap spread or yield substitute which suggests that the most senior class could be a potential candidate for level b lcr treatment similar to the absrmbs products included in the eu regulation further clarity and research may be warranted before final implementation overall the trading data and market sizes that we were able to examine suggest that the classification systems and haircuts are generally appropriate but may need to be further researched and enhanced before being fully phased in one particular topic that may need to be addressed is the differences in rules by jurisdiction because these new rules will likely influence global investment decisions and which formats of financing will continue to be available to borrowers in various markets the current international proposed rules appear to favor some bond products while disfavoring others and thus we may see further adjustment before final implementation to avoid unintended consequences the federal reserve’s proposal to include certain municipal bonds as level a hqla in the us regulations is one example of an adjustment currently under consideration appendix holdings of major us asset types table  holdings of major us asset types asset   top five holders as of          treasury

rental securitization where are we and where will we be  sunday oct  posted by crefc in autumn  ≈ leave a comment tagsblackstone borrower cmbs finance lender reit rent securitization the fledgling singlefamily rental sfr market—formed in the wake of the financial crisis as institutional investors amassed large portfolios from foreclosure auctions and short sales—is on the verge of some major developments deals securitized since the firstever sfr securitization by invitation homes in november  have been substantially alike with investors primarily being large institutions but that is about to change as new lending programs alter the profile of the collateral and the investor base expands the sfr market has expanded substantially in the past few years and will continue to do so as demands for sfr homes and rents are expected to continue to increase property management becomes more efficient and historical performances have demonstrated generally low rental vacancy and delinquency rates with housing prices rising institutional investors will seek to cash out their sfr portfolios and together with heightened demand for sfr houses from millennials and availability of new lending programs for retail sfr investors sfr market is likely to shift from large institutional players to smaller individual investors  what is more a new asset class—landlord loans—is expected to grow substantially where we are to date there have been  sfr securitizations exhibit  shows the timeline of these securitizations  sfr industry has expanded tremendously in the past two years  according to commercial mortgage alert the us cmbs issuance was about  billion and the us sfr issuance was about  billion in   as of july  yeartodate us sfr issuance is  billion up  from  billion for the same period in  whereas yeartodate us cmbs issuance is  billion up  compared to the same period in   the sfr bond market is currently estimated to be a  billion market with blackstone’s invitation homes unit having a leading market share of  through its seven offerings totaling  billion  american homes  rent stands second at  billion followed by colony american homes at  billion typical structure is as follows an investor first forms a reit or llc and raises debt andor equity financing to acquire a portfolio of sfr homes and then transfers such portfolio to a borrower typically an lp or llc where it serves as the general partner owning  of the borrower the borrower then obtains a loan secured by the first priority mortgage on such portfolio the loans typically have two to three year terms with the borrower’s option of multiple oneyear extensions for a total of five years  the lender then transfers the secured loan to depositor typically an lp or llc who will deposit such loan in a special purpose entity that is bankruptcyremote and will issue debt securities  these debt securities are callable andor noncallable bonds with first lien security interest over rental incomes from the collateralized sfr homes and sometimes are also backed by pledge of equity interest in the borrower and guarantees from sponsors  similar to cmbs issuances these sfr offerings typically elect remic structure every sfr offering to date has received triplea rating on its most senior tranche credit rating agencies have adopted methodology that leverages elements of cmbs and rmbs criteria because the collateral underlying an sfr transaction has both commercial and residential characteristics  loantovalue ltv ratio ranges from  to  with an average of approximately   later deals tend to have higher ltv ratio as the industry becomes more comfortable with the asset class and issuers consider structuring deals with an added risk retention tranche  that allows the securities to be sold in europe as was the case with the invitation homes sfr offering  all but four offerings have been priced using libor with coupon size for its top tranche ranging from  to  basis points  two of the four fixed rate bonds have been issued by american homes  rent in september  and march  respectively and the other two fixed rate deals were by firstkey lending in april  and progress residential in may   the underlying portfolios for the sfr securitizations issued during the past year ranged in size from  to  properties with an average of   the largest offering to date is the  billion floating rate interestonly offering by invitation homes secured by mortgages on  incomeproducing sfr homes issued in june  as sfr securitization market develops there have been several structural variations the first three deals offered were structured to amortize whereas the following seven deals have been structured as interestonly loans  the offerings by firstkey lending and br finance in april  were the first multiborrower sfr securitizations backed by multiple loans to one or more entities  prior to these offerings transactions have been backed by one loan from a single borrower  some later offerings involved additional investor protections such as backup property manager that would step in and gain control in the event of materially adverse conditions is sfr securitization market competitive while the growth of sfr market is expected to slow as foreclosures slow and housing prices recover bottom line can be strengthened as institutional investors become more focused in particular msas and experienced at managing properties rental market remains strong with overall rents increasing and delinquency and vacancy rates remain low institutional investors are becoming much more selective in new portfolio acquisitions and are shifting their focus to managing their properties collecting rents and improving operations for example invitation homes has recently agreed to sell about  atlantaarea residences in order to focus on creating highlyefficient sfr infrastructure in certain msas  focusing on particular msas will make property management more efficient and homogenous which is an important factor for many of the sfr bond investors as the continuity of net cash flows from the underlying properties depends heavily on the ability of their owners to manage large numbers of sfr homes which are often geographically dispersed and uniquely constructed hence cannot be implemented with a onesizefitsall approach sfr market is not likely to contract any time soon and overall rents have been and will continue to rise according to moody’s sfr homes make up about  of the us housing stock up from  before the financial crisis  the number of sfr homes has increased  since  to  million from  million and as of july  singlefamily rentals comprise  of the rental market which nearly equals multifamily rental share of   as millennials start to form families but are typically unable or unwilling to buy homes the rental numbers are expected to go up  strong demand for rental homes have translated into rents increase and the median asking rent has been continuously rising as seen in exhibit   rent growth is expected to accelerate this year as landlords plan to raise their rents as much as  on renewals and  for new tenants and will average nearly  per annum through the end of the decade  combined with lower rental vacancy rates exhibit  and lower homeownership rates exhibit  in the second quarter of  in comparison to that of  bottom line is expected to further improve  exhibit  shows that the rental vacancy rate is at a historic low according to morgan stanley large buyers have spent about  billion amassing about  sfr homes given that  billion of securities tied to approximately  homes have so far been issued there are still plenty of sfr properties available in the market to be securitized  additionally historical performances of the prior sfr offerings have been quite assuring  granted the very first sfr securitization had initially sparked concerns as collected rents declined by  within  months of the cutoff date with a stabilized vacancy rate  higher than the issuer’s prediction   however these vacancy numbers were still well within the rating agencies’ stressed parameters and more importantly despite a reduction in rental cash flows received payments were nonetheless made in full to bondholders  as the market develops both delinquency rates and vacancy rates have been generally low and stable  according to morningstar the monthend delinquency rates of may  ranged between  with american rental properties sfr deal being an anomaly with  and the vacancy rates among sfr securitizations remaining relatively flat monthovermonth at an average lower than  despite a general trend of a rising number of lease expirations where is sfr market heading although institutional investors are likely to remain involved in the sfr market for quite some time in the face of rising interest rates climbing home prices high student debt tight credit conditions and depressed incomes that limit opportunities for wouldbe homebuyers the sfr market is expected to eventually shift from largerscale investors to smaller individual investors with housing prices having recovered nearly their precrisis peaks these institutional investors will want to cash out and realize their profits by liquidating their portfolios rather than holding properties and associated market risks on their balance sheets both invitation homes and starwood waypoint residential trust plan to sell about  of their sfr portfolios every year  moreover although millennials are expected to rent for the next few years they will eventually want to become homeowners as they form families and become financially more stable and may even be forced to buy houses if rents outpace housing prices  additionally access to credit is set to increase for retail investors looking to purchase sfr properties  private equity firms have already begun or are seriously considering offering socalled landlord loans and renttoown programs the blackstone group colony capital and cerberus capital management are providing landlord loans to small and midsize investors buying singlefamily homes  over the last year subsidiaries and affiliates of all three private equity firms have reportedly lent about  billion collectively where most of these loans range from  to  million in size are two to five years in length have interest rates of  and are backed by mortgages on the properties and sometimes the rental payments on the homes blackstone is also considering whether to offer renttoown programs or future financing options for tenants who will eventually become homeowners these new lending platforms are generating another exciting securitization opportunity as these firms are gearing up to bundle those loans into bonds indeed the first landlord loan securitization is expected to hit the market in the next few weeks  given little competition these firms face with the only other significant sfr lenders being fannie mae and freddie mac which limits their financings to true momandpop investors and hardmoney lenders whose loans tend to be for short periods of time and carry higher than normal
