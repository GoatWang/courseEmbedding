be wary of gero vita a glenn braswell and braswells journal of longevity home search your guide to quackery health fraud and intelligent decisions send this page to a friend      be wary of gero vita a glenn braswell and braswells journal of longevity stephen barrett md almon glenn braswell  sold pills and potions through the mail he probably took in more money and more people than any similar marketer in us history this article details what he did looks at connections he had with prominent politicians and describes some of the actions law enforcement took against him most of braswells marketing was done under the name gero vita international which offered a large line of dietary supplements from its web site and by mail its brochures described the comnpany as specialists in ailmenttargeted natural formulas in  the company and its sister corporations began blanketing the country with mailings under various names and addresses in the united states and canada over the years i have collected solicitations ostensibly from gero vita laboratories life force laboratories vita industries health quest publications rein anton md phd james f balch jr md hyla cass md benjamin friedrich md jay gordon md and joseph d weissman md although many of the solicitations had a canadian return address all of the products were packaged and shipped from within the united states the late ted ponich who was gb datas chief operating officer from  through  believed that gero vita was the biggest direct marketer of health products in the united states with  million mailings per month and  sales of about about  million  a  ad for a sales director stated that gb data systems was grossing  million annually the products contained vitamins minerals herbs andor other supplement ingredients that are promoted with claims related to allergies prostate trouble arthritis digestive disorders blood sugar balance bone and joint health memory vascular health detoxification weight management immune support antiaging sexual enhancement and much more purchase of any product entitled the buyer to a free oneyear subscription available separately for  to the journal of longevity previously called the journal of longevity research a monthly magazine that braswell published the magazines advisory board included several wellknown promoters of quackery each issue contained articles suggesting that many diseases are caused by nutrient shortages and that various substances are therapeutic products containing these supplements could be obtained by calling a tollfree number or submitting an order form located in the magazine some of the products may have had some effectiveness though overpriced but most were promoted with misleading claims evaluation of the individual products was difficult because their ingredients were not listed in the ads but it is clear that many of the advertised claims went far beyond what was possible one brochure for its product prostata for example claimed that a prostate enlargement can be treated successfully with zinc supplements b the side effects of drugs prescribed to shrink the prostate are almost as bad as the prostate disorder itself c saw palmetto in addition to relieving prostate symptoms might also be an aphrodisiac d another herbal ingredient reduced enlarged prostate problems in as high as  of cases and has no significant side effects e it is important to take prostata before it is too late the last page of the brochure contained pictures of six movie stars three prominent athletes and a former chief executive officer of time warner who either waited too long and died from prostate problems or waited too long and are suffering some in the latter group sued braswell for misrepresentation and for improperly using their name and picture for marketing purposes     another product gerovita gh was said to be an antiaging formula based on the work of anna aslan a rumanian physician who developed gerovital h an injectable product she claimed was the secret of eternal vigor and youth its principal ingredient was procaine a local anesthetic although many uncontrolled studies have reported great benefits from the use of gh controlled trials have failed to demonstrate any improvement in elderly patients noting that paraaminobenzoic acid paba and diethylaminoethanol dmae appear in the urine of people receiving procaine injections a few american manufacturers have been selling procaine tablets containing paba andor dmae with false claims similar to those made for gh the fda has taken regulatory action against several companies marketing gh products but other brands still are marketed braswells gerovita gh formula contained paba dmae and several vitamins and minerals a gero vita brochure—stop the clock scientists say you can live  longer and healthier—contained  testimonials that gerovita gh relieved arthritis caused leg swelling to disappear improved sex life lowered blood pressure turned hair darker improved memory softened skin sped healing relieved back pain improved endurance stabilized growth of a cataract and made people look much younger however there is no reason to believe that any ingredient in the product could produce any of these effects for several years braswells vita industries sent solicitations for gerovita gh that resembled an ordinary large twosided newspaper page with a handwritten note addressing the recipient by first name and signed with someones initial one in my files for example stated dear dorothy youve got to try this it works j ads of this type are designed to make the recipient think they come from someone they know however recipients might also be upset by the thought that the sender thinks they look too old in  the iowa attorney general obtained a consent decree and injunction barring vita industries from promoting selling or advertising any drug or nutriotional product that had not been shown to be safe and effective by at least two welldesigned scientific studies and is generally recognized as safe and effective for its intended purpose the company was also assessed  and ordered to make full refunds to any consumer who complained within  days after the order was issued it was also barred from marketing its products in iowa  later that year after it sent solicitations to an investigator from the attorney generals office the company signed a second consent agreement to pay  to the states elderly fund  in  the national advertising division of the council of better business bureaus inc announced that gero vita international had failed to substantiate advertising for a gh antiaging pill which had claimed new antiaging pill stops aches pains fatigue depression improves memory skin tone and sex drive grey hair gone reduces chance of heart attack by  people taking gero h lived  longer  in  the fda banned the importation of all of gero vitas products marketed with claims that they can prevent or treat disease in  the ban was extended to cover life force laboratories  the ban was set up because many of the mailings used a canadian ordering address for gero vita laboratories which suggested that the company was located in canada the ban was not effective however because the canadian locations simply forwarded the orders which were filled from within the united states gero vita also invited doctors to join its mediplex physicians nutrition network which would enable them to buy its products at  to  discounts for resale to their patients one reason for braswells commercial success was his association with health professionals whom he listed as advisors andor authors of articles in his publications some of them were also quoted with their picture in his advertising brochures a  brochure stated that the chairman of gero vitas medical advisory board was murray susser md who practiced in california in  susser was charged with unprofessional conduct gross negligence incompetence repeated negligent acts and excessive use of diagnostic procedures the complaint charged that he had failed to diagnose gallstones in one patient and colon cancer in two others in each case he ordered inappropriate tests failed to order appropriate tests and prescribed vitamins and other inappropriate treatment in  susser signed a stipulated settlement under which he paid  for costs and served three years on probation  in january  he surrendered his new york state medical license without contesting that he had been disciplined by the medical board of california for gross negligence and incompetence another gero vita advisor james r privitera md was convicted in  of conspiring to prescribe and distribute laetrile a quack cancer remedy and was sentenced to six months in prison in  after the appeals process ended he served  days in jail but was released after being pardoned by california governor jerry brown privitera was sanctioned by californias licensing board others listed as mediplex advisory board members have included hans j kugler phd douglas hunt phd yuguo ni licac ilona abraham md ronald disalvo phd joseph weissman md paul yutsis phd donald c thompson md dph carol uebelacker md ronald lawrence md phd gary s ross md and daniel mowrey phd for more details about braswells advisors click here background history during the late s and early s braswell marketed many products claimed to cure baldness enlarge the female breast delay the aging process cause weight loss remove cellulite and improve the growth and appearance of fingernails anyone who purchased at least  worth of the products was given a free month subscription to body forum a magazine filled with ads and supportive editorial content—the same setup used for the journal of longevity braswell holds the record as the person against whom the postal service filed the largest number of healthrelated false representation complaints as a postal service official summarized at a congressional hearing in  one hundred and thirtyeight false representation complaints were filed against  different medicalcosmetic products marketed by braswell inc through a multitude of addresses in atlanta ga and fort lauderdale fl these cases were concluded through  false representation orders and  consent agreements    evidence in one case revealed that braswell received over  million for a worthless baldness cure in one sixmonth period mr braswell pled guilty to mail fraud charges involving the faking of before and after advertising photographs purportedly revealing the results of bust developer hair growth and cosmetic products and was sentenced to five years probation he was also sentenced to a threeyear prison term for federal income tax evasion and perjury charges developed during our mail fraud investigation  at the hearing braswell said his corporations had probably grossed over  million in  years this ad which appeared in the august  issue of body forum was one of many he used to market vitamin tablets and lotions as baldness remedies the ad falsely claimed that hereditary baldness was caused by nutritional shortages and could be halted by a hair lotion called biogenesis the ad featured pictures that supposedly represented the appearance of a manys scalp before and after using the product malepattern baldness is responsible for  of all hair loss in men and also occurs in women although a specific cause cannot be identified it is probably related to hereditary factors especially among caucasians an excess of male hormones androgens such as testosterone and possibly attacks on scalp hair follicles by the bodys immune system nutritional deficiencies are not a factor and there is no reason to believe that braswells lotion stimulated hair growth although the ad claimed that european doctors had reported an  success rate in experiments medical experts who investigated this claim concluded that the studies did not provide sufficient basis for such a claim  the administrative law judge decisions against braswell and his former companies are posted in full on the us postal service web site to access them search for cosvetic peak labs  earthquest standard research vangault labs or quest research   in  braswell and his companies settled ftc charges that they did not have adequate scientific evidence that their hairloss products worked and and that they had not paid refunds as promised to their customers under a courtapproved agreement the parties agreed to pay  in penalties and were permanently barred from making performance or efficacy claims for any product or service without reliable scientific evidence to substantiate the claim  curiously biogenesis and several of braswells other products are still being marketed today in  an article on the club head start web site stated that when braswell ceased operations in  vitamin products international was formed to take over ongoing operation of the business political connections braswell had connections to george w bush and georges brother jeb bush when he was governor of florida braswell and his companies have donated a total of at least  to their campaigns and to the republican party date amount donor recipient   a glenn braswell national republican senatorial committee    a glenn braswell george w bush campaign committee    a glenn braswell republican party of florida federal account    a glenn braswell state committee republican party of florida    gb data systems republican national committee    gb data systems republican party of florida  the july  issue of the journal of longevity contained an article by jeb accompanied by a picture of him and george the article stated in part with the november elections fast approaching healthcare is a toppriority issue facing candidates and voters    i have always paid close attention to the needs of seniors and their impact on policy reform my brother george w also has maintained a strong focus on these seasoned veterans and their needs and what need could be more important than health however todays health scene bristles with perplexing problems inadequate insurance coverage the soaring cost of prescription drugs and the many restrictions of managed care one of the most important issues that both my brother and i believe will become even more critical due to this senior boom is integrative medicine    i see it as combining the best elements of two worlds the best of conventional medicine with its lifesaving drugs and surgical procedures and the best of alternative medicine with its natural approaches to chronic diseases i can see this integration of the two sides of medicine already taking place driving the new partnership is the growing demand for therapies and nutrients that are safe and without side effects    further a number of healthcare providers have found these therapies very costeffective more and more insurance companies are covering acupuncture chiropractic homeopathic massage therapy traditional chinese medicine and other modalities to reinforce the process of change i would stress the importance of prevention i advocate preventive measures to maintain wellness such as regular checkups screening tests for early detection public programs to help promote healthy lifestyles and more effective guidance for dealing with chronic health problems prevention also is founded on proper nutrition to maintain wellness and avoid disease thereby extending life span this means our seniors should have access to a full array of nutrients the vitamins and minerals that tend to become depleted with age as well as the herbs and other natural substances that can relieve chronic disorders  how did jeb bushs article wind up in braswells magazine bushs representatives told investigators from newsweek and the st petersburg times that the article they had submitted had been altered without their knowledge or consent  but conflicting accounts emerged the times reported that bushs policy advisers said they had received a call urging them to do the article from ann herberger a miami woman who is in charge of raising money for george w bushs presidential campaign herberger also served as finance director for jeb bushs campaign for governor in  and headed up inaugural plans jebs policy staff prepared the article after talking with the magazines editor  journal of longevity editor ron tepper told a newsweek reporter that braswell had sought the article because both jeb and his brother george w bush appeared sympathetic to alternative medicine tepper said that one of his staff members prepared a draft that was given to jebs aids for approval  the investigators also reported in south carolina three famous sports figures richard petty stan musial and len dawson have filed suit in federal court against braswell and gero vita for misusing their names in advertisements for prostata the lawsuits filed in  by charleston lawyers e vernon glenn and gedney m howe iii involve advertisements that identify the three sports figures among a group of men who waited too long and are suffering from prostate problems the lawsuits accused braswell the magazine and his companies of defamation invasion of privacy unfair trade practices and intentionally inflicting emotional distress  in  while serving his federal prison sentence braswell entered a no contest plea to a grand theft charge stemming from a burglary arrest at a home he was renting to a former employee in fort lauderdale he was put on probation for two years to run concurrently with his federal sentence  court records show that federal prosecutors in los angeleshad opened a criminal investigation with the irs into some of braswells companies including allegations involving the transfer of funds from gb data to offshore accounts according to the documents prosecutors said they were also investigating allegations involving an offshore trading company and alleged efforts by braswell and his employees to conceal documents from the government  the resultant miniscandal apparently hhad some effect the day following the above reports republican party officials decided to return  of the contributions they also said that—as a result of inquiries made by the times reporter—they had determined to return  check braswell gave at a south florida fundraiser for george w bush  the pardon scandal and further trouble on his last day as president of the united states bill clinton included braswell among the  felons whom he pardoned the pardon was for braswells  conviction pardons normally require demonstrated good conduct for a substantial period of time after the criminal sentence is completed braswells longstanding mailorder scams hardly fit that description many major news outlets reported that he was under investigation by the fda ftc internal revenue service and several state attorneys general and that a federal grand jury in los angeles was investigating him for money laundering and tax evasion  as the scandal broke dozens of reporters began trying to understand why clinton pardoned braswell it turned out that the attorney who actually delivered the pardon application was hillary rodham clintons brother hugh rodham who was promised payment of  if the pardon was granted bill clinton stated that he was unaware of braswells pending legal troubles and both bill and hillary clinton denied knowing that hugh rodham was advocating for braswell ironically the pardon may have served a useful purpose by causing regulatory agencies to give higher priority to braswells illegal activities in  the united states senate special committee on aging held a hearing that focused on braswell and his misdeeds  the hearing included testimony from a former business associate  and from an attorney who had sued braswell on behalf of several clients  in  the ftc charged braswell four corporations and ron tepper with false advertising  in  after having pleaded guilty to tax evasion and paid more than  million in back taxes penalties and interest  braswell was sentenced to  months in prison a few weeks later the ftc amended its civil complaint to add drs lawrence and kugler as defendants  in june  the corporations tepper and lawrence settled the charges against them by agreeing to pay a total of  and to refrain from making unsubstantiated claims for products in the future  in october kugler agreed to pay  and to refrain from making future endorsements that are not based on competent evidence or within his represented areas of expertise  in december  braswell signed a stipulation under which he would pay  million and turn over assets worth  million to settle the ftc’s charges could not market or help others in the directresponse marketing of any food dietary supplement or drug for which a health benefit is claimed directly or by implication except for fdaapproved product claims was prohibited from making false or unsubstantiated claims for all healthrelated products and services  in january  chase revel who created some of the ads agreed to pay  for consumer redress and to post a  million performance bond before advertising marketing or selling any food drug dietary supplement device or healthrelated service  gero vita continued to market many of the products but braswell no longer owned it and the claims made for the products were toned down braswell died on october   it would be interesting to know why the fda the ftc and the us postal service did not try to stop his illegal activities sooner
