meet sarah isley from in love with bodycare  beauty guru skip to content beauty guru turning women into enlightened beauty consumers since  primary menu meet sarah isley from in love with bodycare people to knowbeautygurumay  may   if you’ve paid attention to the guru’s favorite products you may  have noticed i’ve become a big fan of the brand in love with bodycare over the last year to me this brand has all the qualities i look for when i seek out an allnatural beauty company that’s truly trustworthy it’s a small independent company run by a group of sisters their products are original effective and made with topquality allnatural ingredients i recently talked with sarah isley one of the sisters who founded in love with bodycare here is what she had to say… q i’ve heard that your company was started by six sisters and one sisterinlaw six sisters seriously do you all have names a ha ha yes seriously… and luckily our parents did give us all names from oldest to youngest they are charity sarah mary anna daisy alyssa and a sisinlaw named caryl we also have two brothers dave and drew q what were you all doing before you started the company a we were bank robbers actually… we were all doing different things in different parts of the country at different times we were all involved in the company that our grandmother started over  years ago but we all have somewhat of a gypsy inclination so we did a lot of traveling and moving around for a few years q what was the aha moment that let you know you had to create your own brand a it was when we realized how great the products that we were making for ourselves worked and how unique they were even within the natural market we decided that if we had been searching for products like these others would be excited about them too we already had them and knew how amazing they were why not share them q why did you decide that creating a new line of products was necessary with so many others on the market what sets you apart from other brands a every product we release must be completely pure deliver extraordinary results and be unique it’s skincare that also benefits the body and the senses if we could have found everything we wanted in other products we never would have felt the need to make something else so every product we make is different than anything we’ve ever used before  also… because of research we had been doing we knew the potential of some fairly unknown at this point ingredients for skinbody care such as mushrooms and saponins and we wanted to incorporate these amazing compounds in to our skin care because the benefits are incredible q you call the man who helped formulate your line “the genius”…he sounds like quite the enigma…can you tell us a little more about him or his background a he is quite the enigma… and if we tell you much more about him he would probably kill us but he is the kind of person you only meet once in a great while he is a genius inventor machinist has studied botanicals and chemistry for about  years and loves mountain dew q how much input do you have in the formulation process how long does it take from inception to finished product a we are all very involved in the whole process anytime one of us comes up with an idea for a product we want to have we’re usually directly involved in the formulation of it even down to researching and choosing the best ingredients then of course we all test it and give our input until we come up with something we’re all happy with how long the process takes depends on the product… some are harder to perfect q you mention that many of the methods and ingredients you incorporate into your products aren’t used by other skincare manufacturers because they are more expensive…can you give a few examples a well there is a huge difference in the quality of the same ingredients depending on where you get them and how they are grown and processed for example cheap coconut oil does not have near the same quality or chemistry as more expensive organic coconut oil another example is that we use a high quality medicinal mushroom blend a label could say that a product contains mushrooms and advertise all the amazing benefits of them but if they just used a cheap blend of less powerful mushrooms you will not get the same benefits using small amounts of the key ingredients in a premade cheap lotion base will not deliver amazing results as for methods… we have to use certain methods that are not cheap to keep the purity and effectiveness of our products and get the consistencies that we need the methods we use such as our carbon neutral distiller also ensure that our manufacturing processes are all ecoresponsible that question is hard to answer in a short version… i could tell you much more q one thing i love about you guys is that unlike many allnatural lines your prices are reasonable how are you able to keep the costs to the  consumer so low a we mark up our products based on the cost of raw materials and we do not inflate the price just to be expensive and exclusive even though our product quality fits us into that category we want to offer better results than expensive skincare to every girl at an affordable price q what does a typical “business day” look like for you you mention all your manufacturing is done “inhouse”…what exactly does that mean do you oversee the place where the products are made a yes… our lab is in the same building as our design and fulfillment center so we can oversee the manufacturing and development we do everything from label design marketing customer service order fulfillment etc… so our typical business day varies and is not always “typical” q what’s been the biggest challenge you’ve faced as a beauty brand entrepreneur a it has to be the misinformation that comes from both sides of the industry there are the companies claiming to be natural that are giving the natural skincare industry a bad name by not being honest about their ingredients and  then there is the other side that is trying to capitalize on that to over regulate the natural skincare industry  these organizations are putting a lot of unscientific data out there as fact pretending to be consumer advocates and actually misguiding them in the process we completely agree that the skincare industry should be transparent and held accountable for their ingredients and methods but some of the over regulation they propose is not only completely unnecessary but also counter productive  for instance many agencies are requiring natural products to list the scientific name of the botanicals on their label we do not do that because which are you most likely to recognize butyrospermum parkii or shea butter q what’s the one product ingredient you’ve come to believe is the most impressive or effective in an allnatural beauty routine and why a it’s a toss up… i think mushrooms are so amazing for the skin in every way because of their completely unique skin rejuvenating properties and structure i also think soap berries saponins are incredible due to their multifaceted action they are a virtually undiscovered wonder in skincare and cleansing products and i eventually expect to see them become a popular ingredient q what is the one product in your line that you couldn’t live without…the product you feel has really changed your life forever a it’s very hard to pick just one… the rejuvenating lotion and perfecting mist have changed my life the cleanser has changed all of our lives and none of us could live without the deodorant the rejuvenating lotion has given me my best skin ever i feel like it is going to prevent future aging skin damage and maybe even skin cancer and the perfecting mist is absolutely genius it’s like being able to reapply your favorite anti blemishaging moisturizer anytime you want while refreshing your senses and reviving your complexion at the same time it leaves you glowing and can even be used over makeup sorry i think i just ruined the question but i couldn’t pick just one q bodacious objects a bustenhancing cream is such an unusual product—it’s one that you don’t typically see in the allnatural beauty market what i’d like to know is does it actually work and if so what’s the secret a haha yes it works we can tell you that  from experience it doesn’t add  cup sizes but it might give you one or two and it definitely adds fullness size and firmness it makes you go from feeling insecure to… sexy it works by increasing the natural production of the hormones that increase breast tissue and it also supports breast health it has also changed my life q do you use only organic ingredients why or why not a we use a lot of organic ingredients and most of the ingredients we use that are not certified organic are grown organically they just don’t have the certification certified organic ingredients are more expensive and if we know  the source of an ingredient and that it is just as good even though it doesn’t have a certification we will use it there are also some ingredients for instance dead sea salts that will never be classified as organic because that is not even the nature of them q which new products on the horizon are you most excited about and why  a i’m very excited about our “mist” collection that’s in the works as well as our “antiaging” and “pregnancy” collections the “mist” collection is exciting because it will give women a whole new way to get the powerful benefits of an anti aging or anti acne serum all day long while also keeping the skin hydrated continuously which is one of the number one ways to prevent aging i can’t say enough about the mists… i’m addicted leave a reply cancel your email address will not be published required fields are
