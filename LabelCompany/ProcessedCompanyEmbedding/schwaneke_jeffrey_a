schwaneke describes his role as centene corps cfo as traditional but given the initiatives he’s helped push through the job is anything but schwaneke was promoted to chief financial officer at centene

centene through two transformational initiatives — a… more dilip vishwanat  slbj within a month he’d already steered the company through the final phases of a  billion acquisition and gotten the ball rolling on a massive  million headquarters expansion in downtown clayton to say he’s been busy would be quite an understatement “certainly there’s a lot of things that have happened” he said schwaneke was officially introduced as cfo on march   though he had been acting in that capacity for several months he was responsible for guiding centene through the last stage of its  acquisition of californiabased health net “it was a lot of the finer points of that transaction” he said “as with any acquisition we had to get all the financing associated with that deal and we had to go through the regulatory approval process that was lengthy and cumbersome” schwaneke  helped secure  billion in financing from wells fargo and steered centene through a  billion debt offering to close funding the deal “jeff played a pivotal role in the analysis and planning for the health net acquisition said centene ceo michael neidorff jeff played an equally important role in negotiating the final deal and subsequently ensuring that the integration of all the financial systems and financialrelated systems went very smoothly he along with two to three other people were really accountable for making it happen and making it happen as well as it did the deal which created the nation’s largest medicaid managed care organization by adding health net’s medicare platform to centene’s existing medicaid programs closed in late march  by then the company was well underway with plans for its campus expansion which was formally unveiled by the company in may  the expansion will include multiple office towers parking garages residential units a hotel and a civic auditorium the first phase of the project will include a squarefoot office tower a squarefoot parking garage and retail space across hanley road from centene’s current headquarters at  forsyth blvd construction of the first phase is expected to start next month with the project completed in 9 schwaneke said the company is still in the process of financing the project and could not comment further “obviously we’ve started the project” he said noting centene officials formally broke ground on the development last month “i’ve been involved in regards to budgets and financing it’s a process” schwaneke figures to have his hands full for the foreseeable future centene is projecting revenue of between  billion and  billion by the end of this year “we’re continuing to grow and we’ve grown fast in the eight years i’ve been here” he said “when i started we had just  billion in revenue now we’re at a projected  billion which is just a staggering amount of growth when you think about it” schwaneke his wife and their three children live in town  country he said he attempts to take up golf “but my handicap isn’t too great really my kids are young and i’m enjoying all their activities like soccer and baseball” schwaneke said he enjoys vacationing with his family as much as he can and tries to take an international trip
