appendix in the presentation materials available on our investor relations website for reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures and related information i will now hand you over to george again to take you through the numbers george fairweather thank you gerald our performance this quarter was in line with our expectations despite challenging conditions in a number of our markets we were particularly pleased with growth in us pharmacy volume and market share as the early benefits of our new pharmacy contracts started to come through we continue to work hard to secure regulatory clearance for the rite aid transaction and we are reiterating our guidance for fiscal  so now lets look at the financial highlights for the quarter as we expected currency again had a negative impact the us dollar being around  higher versus sterling than in the comparable quarter last year sales for the quarter were  billion down  versus the comparable quarter on a constant currency basis sales were up  without the extra day in february last year this would have been up  gaap operating income was  billion a decrease of  gaap net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance were  billion up  and diluted eps was  up  adjusted operating income was  billion down  and constant currency was down  we estimate this would have been broadly flat taking into account the leap year impact adjusted net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance were  billion up  and in constant currency up  adjusted diluted net earnings per share was  up  and in constant currency up  the adjusted effective tax rate which we calculate excluding the equity income from amerisourcebergen was  this was lower than in the same quarter last year primarily due to reduced estimated annual tax rate associated with our current year pretax earnings an incremental discrete tax benefits yeartodate the tax rate on the same basis was  for completeness here are the numbers for the first half of fiscal  i will not go through this in great detail but you will note that gaap diluted net earnings per share was  up  versus the same period a year ago adjusted diluted net earnings per share was  up  and up  on a constant currency basis so let me now turn to the performance of our divisions in the quarter beginning with retail pharmacy usa retail pharmacy usa sales were  billion up  over the year ago quarter comparable store sales increasing by  as  was the leap year when we calculate comparable sales and prescription figures we exclude the  february  adjusted gross profit was  billion down  over the year ago quarter with the impact of the extra day in  holding back growth and adjusted gross profit by over  lower retail gross profit was partially offset by an increase in pharmacy adjusted sga was  of sales an improvement of  percentage points compared to the year ago quarter adjusted sga as a percentage of sales was improved versus comparable quarters for  consecutive quarters as a result of the lower adjusted gross margin adjusted operating margin was down  percentage points of  resulting in adjusted operating income of  billion down  so now lets look in more detail at pharmacy us pharmacy total sales were up  mainly driven by increased retail script volume we filled  million prescriptions on a day adjusted basis including immunizations an increase of  on a comparable basis for stores which excludes central specialty pharmacy sales increased by  with scripts filled up  this was the highest quarterly growth rate in more than seven years and was primarily due to strong volume growth from medicare part d and strategic pharmacy partnerships which we announced last year we are pleased both with the progress of medicare part d an early indications of the benefits derived from our new pharmacy contracts within sales volume growth and brand inflation was partially offset by reimbursement pressure which was in line with what we had anticipated and by the impact of generics our reported market share of retail prescriptions in the quarter on the usual day adjusted basis was  up approximately  basis points over the year ago quarter total retail sales were down  on the same quarter last year this includes the impact of previously announced closure of certain ecommerce operations and the impact of the leap day in the prior year comparable retail sales were down  in the quarter and what was a challenging environment the claims in the consumables and general merchandize and personal care categories partially offset by solid growth in the health and wellness and beauty categories adjusted gross profit was lower than in the same quarter last year primarily due to the decline in sales despite the difficult market conditions we were pleased with growth in our key categories this was reflected by our absolute performance as well as recent market share gains based on the latest nielsen data for the  weeks ended  february we gain share in the health and wellness beauty and personal care categories however we know there is more to do and after taking further actions to help drive future performance these include simplifying our product offering further emphasis on our omnichannel capabilities and expansion of our beauty differentiation program while still early in the journey our own brands are performing well and currently represent over  beauty sales in our beauty differentiation stores we have now recruited beauty advisors across more than  stores which is helping to drive no sales and gross profit repurchase levels of no products are been very encouraging and soap  glory has also got off to a good start following the successful introduction of no and soap  glory we are planning to introduce another of our own brands botanics into our existing beauty differentiation stores in the next six months looking ahead we are now developing plans to introduce our enhanced beauty offering to over  additional stores by the end of the calendar year so next lets look at the progress of our cost transformation program in our previously announced cost transformation program we set ourselves an ambitious target of delivering  billion in savings by the end of fiscal  im delighted to announce that we achieved this target ahead of plan we now expect that the cumulative pretax charges associated with this program will be approximately  billion this is in line with our expectations with an expanded program was announced in april  these costs are higher than we anticipated in october primarily as we now expect to close around  more stores the program will be completed as expected by the end of fiscal  and the full benefits will be realized in future periods we continue to expect but approximately  of the program costs will be in cash over time the principle items being future lease obligations so now lets look at the results of the retail pharmacy international division sales for the division were  billion down  in constant currency again impacted by the leap year comparable store sales decreased  in constant currency comparable pharmacy sales were down  on a constant currency basis due to decline in the uk which is partially offset by growth in other markets in boots uk comparable pharmacy sales were down  mainly due to the reduction in government pharmacy funding comparable retail sales for the division increased  reflecting boots growth in the uk republic of ireland and thailand within the uk boots comparable retail sales increased  versus the year ago quarter supported by solid december trading adjusted gross profit for the division was down  in constant currency to  billion mainly due to lower pharmacy margins in the uk reflecting the reduction in funding and the impact of the leap year  leap day in the prior year adjusted sga in constant currency dollars was flat versus the year ago quarter however adjusted sga as a percentage of sales on a constant currency basis was  percentage points higher of  as a result of the largely fixed cost elements of the cost base adjusted operating margin was  and  percentage points in constant currency this resulted in adjusted operating income of  million a decrease of  again in constant currency so now lets look at our pharmaceutical wholesale division sales for the division were  billion up  versus the same quarter last year on a constant currency basis growth was held back by the sale of alliance healthcare russia in march last year and also by the leap year comparable sales on a constant currency basis were up  this was behind the companys estimate of market growth weighted on the basis of country wholesale sales with challenging market conditions in continental europe partially offset by growth in emerging markets and the uk market growth is particularly strong in certain emerging markets due to the timing of price increases adjusted operating margin which excludes abc was  up  percentage points on a constant currency basis adjusted operating income was  million up  in constant currency excluding the  million and adjusted earnings from abc adjusted operating income was up  in constant currency reflecting procurement and cost benefits operating cash flow in the quarter was  billion during the quarter our working capital inflow was  billion this reflected our seasonal reduction in inventories as well as an improved receivables position cash capital expenditure in the quarter was  million this was lower than in the first quarter mainly due to phasing as i said last quarter we continue to invest in our core customer proposition including our stores and us beauty program as well as the upgrades to our it systems which we have previously talked about this resulted in free cash flow for the quarter of  billion today we announced a new share repurchase program of up to  billion in this calendar year with the flexibility to do this due to the changes to the pending rite aid transaction announced in january so turning next to our guidance for fiscal  we have maintained guidance and continue to expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of  to  remember our guidance assumes current exchange rates remaining constant for the rest of the fiscal year and no material accretion from rite aid or from the new strategic alliance with prime announced on monday so i’ll now hand over to stefano for his concluding comments stefano pessina thank you george so as you have seen we have once come to you with quarterly results pretty much in line with our expectation however the drivers behind the results given depending on where we are with the development and continual transformation of our businesses but we have many different levers to pull to fine tune the company and that is our some confidence in our ability to deliver solid financial performance this quarter much of the most visible work we are reporting have been in driving efficiency within the company further improving the cash flow from the businesses and the cost factor we are doing this while we continue to operate as likely and efficient balance sheet as we work to complete our proposed acquisition of rite aid even in the balance sheet however you can see the signs of our drive for constant improvement we are returning an element of value to the shareholder through our new share buyback program without undermining our intention of profitable leverage the company following the closing of the proposed rite aid acquisition the us prime pharmacy market is performing very much as we believe it would pricing pressures are increasing further rest the steady and our relenting volume growth in the use of medication to meet these challenges we believe that collaboration and corporation is vital it is vital across healthcare system as a whole and between all the components of rite from the regulators to the individual pharmacy who serve their communities every day we have proved timeandtime again that by shaping our business to anticipate and address what is clearly identifiable trend we can operate growing and thriving businesses in this environment as we grow and develop our company we seek to ensure whether the structure and nature of our business is properly aligned with the needs of the market in this we will never do anything that we are not convinced if in the longterm interest of our shareholder if we do not believe this to be the case we will not do it a very good example of our commitment to working in partnership is our strategic alliance with prime this puts in place a new pharmacy contract between our two companies and brings together our central specialties and mail order businesses infrastructure in which we have just over  it is designed to improve our scale and competitive position in our service competitive pricing and improved market access relationship like this are about more than just improving what we have today they can create an entirely new set of opportunities for us to approach the market achieving more together quicker than either of us could do alone and in a structure that has ensured we both benefit fairly as a result while this will not have a significant infrastructure on our adjusted earnings per share this fiscal year it is benefiting our volume and sales and as we integrate this business over time we believe it will benefit our adjusted operating income equally important it establishes a strategically beneficial alliance to deliver future growth by better addressing the needs of a changing market since the announcement our strategic alliance has already contributed to prime winning two significant contracts which demonstrates how well it is being received by the market and we are addressing some of the legacy business issue in walgreens and are seeing a script volumes return we are in a much better position to begin to address the operational challenges which market demands will continue to place upon us the retail market in the us has its own economic and the competitive pressure there is no doubt that it is harsh and unforgiving economic climate in which to be reviewing and updating a retail offering but we are making progress you have heard george talk about the early indication of success in our strategy for beauty of using our strategy and brands to differentiate our trend the growth we have seen in the health and wellness and beauty category sales and underlying margin in our stores is encouraging our decision to expand the beauty differentiation of strategy reflects the positive response we have heard from our customer with revolution of our walgreens beauty offering we expect to see leading surpass the beauty brands sowing in path of the growing range in our store of course our work in beauty is only part of the changes we intend to make to change and enhance this retail mix and offering record outdoor this work is mainly simple not quick as we do it we must constantly monitor each individual change carefully balancing the space and location of each product needs and the overall customer experience there are however plenty of example of how successful this can be if you get it right turning to rite aid i am still optimistic that we will bring this deal to a successful conclusion but there is no doubt that the process of getting clear for the transaction is taking longer than we expected we are constantly and currently cooperating with ftc rite aid and freds to get the necessary approval and close the transaction at the same time we are working to be in a position to certify compliance we believe that we can achieve these in the coming weeks and we are still working towards our revised timetable to obtain a clearance by the end of july the changes to the bill that we agreed in january demonstrate our absolute commitment to ensure all transactions that meet our demanding financial and strategic requirement while allowing us the ability to address any reasonable demand that may be made for us in obtaining regulatory approval in terms of guidance as george said we are reiterating our estimate range for the full fiscal year looking to the second half and beyond there are some big challenges ahead and theres a lot of hard work but a huge amount of opportunity overall therefore we have confidence that in our ability to continue to generate and capture true value for our shareholder for this year and beyond thank you now i will hand you back to gerald gerald gradwell thank you stefano we will now open the lines for questions vince questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question is from robert jones of goldman sachs your line is open robert jones great thanks for the question given the really strong samestore script comp this quarter thats  you guys highlighted can you share any thoughts on maybe why you didn’t see a stronger corresponding increase in the front end seems to be a little bit of a disconnect between the strength and the script count and then the performance on the front end comp alex gourlay hi bob its alex here yes i think in the prepared remarks george and both stefano said it was a tough market first of all so we saw good growth in a tough market particularly in healthcare which you expect to see the link to the pharmacy business and also through investment in beauty care we saw again some solid growth where we didn’t see growth in the front end was really in the seasonal businesses it was a tough valentines day for the whole market and also in food where theres quite a lot of deflation driven by competition and some commodity pricing that sort of affect us last summer is still running we do track as best as we can link sales and we are confident that we are seeing the link we expected im also very confident as the market moves on this new volume and the new food will improve the front end performance against the strategy that we have clearly laid out robert jones okay great thanks and then i guess just going back to the rite aid deal on the timing stefano you talked about this obviously dragging on longer than you anticipated i guess where exactly are you in the ftc seeing eyetoeye and then i am curious do you think the deal can get approved given the current configuration of the ftc or does there need to be more commissioners added in order to gain approval stefano pessina well as i said i am still positive on this deal i believe that we have a strong argument to defend this deal i cannot comment on the organization of the ftc it will be up to them to decide whether they have enough people or not to judge on the quality of this deal we are doing what we can together with rite aid and freds we are collaborating very well with the ftc and as i said we are preparing our freds to be ready to  compliance if we will decide to do so robert jones okay great thank you operator our next question is from eric percher of barclays your line is open eric percher thank you stefano i’d like to come back to your comment around prime the fep win was notable and not something we expected to see on their own so it seems like early success as you talk about the opportunities midterm and long term do you see a role as enabling fulfillment in dispensing or do you see walgreens as having a role in enabling pharmacy benefit management as well stefano pessina we believe that we are in the market we have to follow the needs of the market and to be as useful as possible eric percher so are there elements of walgreens negotiation with manufacturers of purchasing that you think are value in the pharmacy benefit space can you add on to what prime has already created there stefano pessina to be honest i believe that the market is evolving is changing and for sure we will have a role to play in this market and we will try to lets say face all the opportunities that we will have in this market eric percher okay fair two words quickly is the buyback at all impacting fiscal year  guidance alex gourlay given the timing that weve just earlier this week announced that would be the buyback of up to  billion it won’t have any material impact in this years earnings where we stop buying back shares eric percher thank you operator our next question is from lisa gill of jpmorgan your line is open lisa gill thanks very much and good morning just given your comments around the challenging frontend environment and the comments of not seeing as much pull through on uncertain whether you talk about seasonal or more commodity or food how do you think about the layout of your store going forward alex i think i heard you say that you did peephole through on a little bit of beauty as well as healthcare do you think about your strategy around retail clinic and maybe perhaps growing that more how do you think about a strategy around lab not talking about theronas but more of blood drawing more services in that aspect as we think about healthcare and to stefanos comment around the changing and evolving landscape as we think about healthcare needs alex gourlay i think you are absolutely right weve clearly got great corners we had a platform of course is a great digital platform so we have definitely got the right presence in the market we dont have the right products in this space so we have physically in our stores and we are doing something about that i mean as george said in his prepared remarks we are now going to accelerate the reduction of our unnecessary skus weve already been working hard in areas like seasonal before this i’m going to go further particularly as we look our lower volume stores are going forward we are very committed to finding the right products on the right healthcare solutions for this space that we free up and weve got good experience in europe for example with our opticians business and with the health and care business and of course weve got good experience here in america with clinics so you’re absolutely right we are really thinking very hard in testing and trialing different ways by which we can offer customers more particularly as we move more health wellness beauty convince model and thats very much part of our thinking but it will take some time i think as we said before to get the right customer experience the right partnerships and particular under economics but we are comfortable to find that model in this marketplace lisa gill great and then just one followup for george if i look at the comps were basically up  on the pharmacy side but sales were up about  how do i think about that i mean clearly i am sure generics was part of that but there is something else is that the reimbursement component of it thats a drag gerald gradwell its the combination if you look at the relativity of generic deflation relative to whats happening on the brand mix is always the other factor and to much lesser extent the reimbursement element lisa gill okay great thank you gerald gradwell thats a combination operator our next question is from john heinbockel of guggenheim securities your line is open sir john heinbockel how do you guys think about the evolution of limited networks going forward the composition of those in a lot of cases is the economics more likely to be around walgreens versus cvs in some of those networks or can it be kind of be more of kind two of you and other retailers not participating how do you think that evolves alex gourlay hi john its alex here i think we play in the marketplace and the marketplace is definitely evolving towards narrower networks we really work hard to figure out what the payer or the marketplace wants whether that be the commercial marketplace or med d and obviously medicaid as well and we work on economic model to see what the volume evolves look like so we don’t try and drive the marketplace in that direction we believe strongly in partnerships we have no best interest apart from looking after our customers and giving good value a combination of price and service but theres no doubt the marketplace is evolving towards narrower networks and we have to operate and participate in that marketplace john heinbockel okay and then completely different given your expertise in beauty is there an opportunity for standalone beauty stores and i say that from a perspective of getting access to brands that you might not be able to  and sort of walgreens box is that an opportunity you simply have too much to do inside a drugstore to think about that alex gourlay we think the opportunity is very much inside of a drug stores and new towards more of a health and beauty convenience specialist thats what we’re seeing the investment and the growth rate now the future of the business will be focused on many ideas but at the moment we’re absolute focused on making the very most of the  million customers who use walgreens today both online and in the pharmacies and also developing a more appropriate beauty offer and were seeing some really good things happening in the early stage of this promotion of this strategy and were going to continue to drive it and as george has said already this will be remarks we’re moving to another close in stores with a beauty differentiation project so that tells you the confidence we have in the strategy john heinbockel okay thank you operator our next question is from steven valiquette of bank of america merrill lynch your line is open steven valiquette thanks good morning everybody congrats on the results yes i guess just on the prime therapeutics the network deal that started back on january  does that care if theres any more color on whether the amount of additional arts volume was in line with your expectations or perhaps slightly better and also are you able to comment on how many of the  blue plans have signed up for the walgreens network deals so far alex gourlay hi steve i can’t obviously again comment on the second one but we can tell you that’s absolutely in line with expectations and i can also tell you that we are pleased and also prime are pleased on the owners of prime are also pleased the blue’s plans who own prime so we satisfied with the progress we’ve made the next phase for us is to give the members of the blue’s a better value and obviously we’re looking at ways we can do that as the market evolves steven valiquette okay and just quickly on rite aid not sure if you can comment on this or not but if for some reason the ftc were to decide that freds cannot be buyer of the rite aid stores the divestitures should we assume that one option would be that walgreens could then still go back to drawing board with other potential buyers of those that in stores or if fred is not the buyer does that essentially kind of bring it in to the potential walgreens rite aid merger just that you’re able to comment on that or is too early to think about that next scenario stefano pessina for the time being stefano here for the time being we believe that fred is the right buyer we believe that they have particular in the configuration – we are proposing now they are absolutely a legitimate player in this industry if for some reason this will not be the case than we will review our options of course and we will take a decision steven valiquette okay all right great thanks operator thank you our next question is from brian tanquilut of jefferies your line is open brian tanquilut hi good morning guys george it looks like youre continuing to make good progress in lowering ga obviously tracking ahead of schedule in that  billion target so how should we think about the opportunity going forward and the flow through for the rest of the year of the  efforts that you put in the past in terms of driving more ga dollars down george fairweather i mean on the particular program that we talked about today we obviously are very pleased to have achieved our target the program will conclude as we previously announced – around the end of this fiscal year some of the benefits of that will obviously – it will continue to see and see more of in the coming years given that nevertheless looking for opportunities to drive efficiency in our sort of businesses is just a way of life so we will absolutely continue to look for opportunities year after year they will come in different places they may be in different geographies but there are always opportunities to drive efficiency and so its just a never ending we’ll continue this program will finish but we’ll continue to look for more opportunities brian tanquilut got it thank you stefano pessina stefano here sorry people say well cutting cost is something that – is an end you cannot really rely on it forever but it’s not just a matter of cutting cost synergies and savings are not just coming from reducing cost very often it depends they can depend on a different organization and so if you have let’s say an approach to the business which is completely open minded you can continue to drive efficiency and reduce cost just changing the organization and this is really worth what we have done for many many years and worked i believe we are relatively good at doing and so we continue to believe that we will able to drive efficiency for many years independently on the obvious cost cutting that everybody can see brian tanquilut yes appreciate the color stefano to followup eric’s question earlier on ftp and specialty i was just wondering how would you describe – the pipeline do you have right now in terms of that partnership with prime on the specialty side in terms of pipeline for new contract or should we think of this as a kind like oneoff wind where it’s kind choppy and also what is the pitch that you guys make to potential client and what differentiate the walgreens and prime specialty offerings alex gourlay hi guys alex here i think – it’s pretty clear about what has gone here is got the attention particularly with the blue’s plans which we are very pleased about and really the pitch is really quite a simple one prime therapeutics really wants that to make sure that the value they create is passed through the blue’s members in different ways and what we do is really as a back shop operator particular of meal order and also specialty i feel is to make sure that we’re really efficient and give great service to at least and a dispensing process so this was a win for prime therapeutics ftp and obviously we believe with our greater scale and our expertise in dispensing prescription and specialty and central fill so that’s gives extra capability to prime and not use to be seem to be marketplace as well brian tanquilut got it thanks guys operator thank you our next question is from ross muken of evercore isi your line is open ross muken just following up on the specialty questions so how was your sort of view of that market and the right competitive landscape and the right level of profits sort of evolved as you thought about the launch of alliance rx because it’s obviously been area there is a lot of scrutiny there is a lot of questions on what the right dollar level per script or what services should be required or should not be required how do you feel like you bring a bit of different viewpoint to may be a market that had been somewhat stagnant in the last couple years in terms of its evolution alex gourlay yes it’s alex again i think that  we bring is that forward that efficiency it’s the marketplace but that went all over and they’re not for sure you know there is others who are larger of being that efficiency as well but secondly we bring the opportunity of the network pharmacies as i said before we don’t just a central fill we actually own independent of alliance rx you the special network that are those in the center of excellence primarily based during the hiv and also we have now a couple of hundreds specialty pharmacies we’ll show you a host of hospitals a host of specialist doctors so again we offer you know with different register market and we offer a different approach and we also believe strongly in this area that we should be paid for the service and the care we provide these are expensive complicated medications we have pharmacists who are playing to the top of the certificates when they’re taking care of patients who are on these medications and we want to make sure that we are adequately remove to that part of the process and other remuneration belong to the other bits in the system for example the pbm for example the insurance company we want to be well rewarded for giving the care that are pharmacy gets in that way ross muken and may be on the big picture side one of the managed care organization have talked about sort of more integrated model or have talked about running a presence closer to the individual obviously you have some of the best real estate and you have also been quite great at lowering cost and prices for individuals and varying that high level of service how of your conversations with managed care around sort of what else you can provide to them or how you were sort of dispensing organization and other services fits in with their goals how is that conversation evolved over time and what should we be focused on in terms of sort of future opportunities high level or big picture that could go on in those relationships alex gourlay yes i can talk again so again you know we have that i just seen  are sourced effectively a couple hundred and over clinics in different ways and in these conversations they focus on really our strategic ability to become a very efficient and very localized dispensing service for them not really resonates with them and secondly we have as you said the real estate whether they can actually come in and have the lower cost ways of delivering services in the community outside of their more expensive systems so these really are the two areas that we talk about a lot and we have a lot of different ways of doing that a lot of ways of working whether it be with advocate here in chicago so again its  and anyway for sure the conversation are good and we are learning together and again goes back to partnership we know what we’re good at i mean all of the areas where we want support and for sure clinic started to integrate is example of that ross muken great thank you operator our next question is from ricky goldwasser of morgan stanley your line is open ricky goldwasser yes good morning a couple thought questions here first of all when we think about the script comps up  basis points quartertoquarter should we think about these comps continuing to accelerate through the back half of the year when you think about the opportunity to capture membership and volume from these partners do you think that it was all captured in the first quarter or well see an uptick later in the year and second question is about kind of like the cadence of margin should we expect to start seeing margins that are associated with these groups improving in the back half of the year alex gourlay hi ricky it’s alex again yes i think that we did have a helpful uptick in seasonal illness on this flu side for weeks which spiked some of the numbers for us presently in q so the way i think about it is that these are driven by two factors the smaller uptick in flu and also all of these contracts and the main started  so two months and then with beauty started as  and the member med d which again we sort of a good season med d again started  so we are confident that the way we have at the moment is what we expected on the strong volume we’ll therefore continue in terms of margin i would think again i’ll go back to the operating margin for us it really is leveraging our fixed assets as we continue to offer market competitive prices not below market but market competitive prices and drive volume through our fixed assets i mean spent levers are more as they have always said in the second half of the year compared to first half of the year its important to look at the annual results as george has reiterated and again we are keeping our guidance for the full year between  and  ebit growth stefano pessina but remember stefano here but remember that our goal has always been to keep the overall operating margin as flat as possible and the dynamic in these market and many other market is that the us to give more to your customers you can get a little more from your suppliers and you can become more efficient and so at the end combining these three elements you have to manage to have a margin overall yearonyear more or less flattish if possible ricky goldwasser okay and following up on that when we think about getting more from the suppliers and getting more efficiencies on the backend do you still see opportunities to improve kind of fact purchasing efficiencies or growth scale for wbad one contract that is going affect up in the market it comes to mind is the express scripts amerisourcebergen contract do you see an opportunity there stefano pessina it had always opportunities in the market and we are looking at the market very carefully and we will try to see all the opportunities that we will see in the market ricky goldwasser okay but is there something that is kind of fact already included in guidance or is that could be potential outside stefano pessina when we give our guidance we try to put in the guidance all the elements that we believe certain or very likely i cannot give you more details as you can easily understand ricky goldwasser and then lastly on the tax rate tax rate came in lower than we anticipated how should we think about the tax rate george for the remaining of the year george fairweather i think really it always looks at the yeartodate effective tax rate and if you look at that from an adjusted basis as i said that was around  so i think tax obviously you know mix can change quarterbyquarter but looking at yeartodate i think it’s perhaps the best way of thinking about this discrete items of course the timing of those there was a little bit uncertain and they can go up or down but think of the yeartodate ricky goldwasser okay thank you operator thank you our next question is from michael cherny of ubs your line is open michael cherny good morning everyone and thank you for all the details so far maybe to ask rickys wbad question a little bit of a different way as you think about the general deflation you’re seeing across the market how do you think about the tradeoff in terms of what youre seeing across the market what you cant control versus what youre doing with regards to sourcing and on go forward basis depending on how you’re planning for what an uncertain scenario to place in an environment how is that positioning you in terms of being able to drive either incremental sourcing or essentially eating some of the potential challenge you have on the pricing side stefano pessina we make certain functions and on the basis of these assumptions we have our internal targets and i repeat the assumptions are taking a really into account all the different pieces of information that we have on the market alex gourlay and so its all in here and i think were in the market so we see how the market is changing in terms of price pressure and we except that and we’re always working on the  areas one is sort of we actually buy that and how do we continue to not just save money as stefano has said but to recreate the organization and move money we’re into invest and as we can grow and grow volume so i think – weve never had and i defy that the pricing pressure is there but it’s never and we’ve always been aware of it and always trying to anticipate that in our guidance so is the market and got to operate within it and for sure we believe we have a strong strategy for the market in the us michael cherny great that’s all for me thanks operator thank you our next question is from alvin concepcion of citi your line is open alvin concepcion thank you just wanted to followup on the question about operating margin in the back half of the year how should we think about it by segment international retail operating margins in the back half should that continue to be challenge at a similar level as you in the quarter or are there opportunities there and also the us is that something that you expect to flatten out in the back half george fairweather i mean obviously we haven’t given specific guidance by segment we had first provide by reiterating our overall guidance figures i mean in terms of thinking about sort of the modeling there is going to be a number of factors that youve got to think about and firstly we will we are consolidating the new prime deal from monday when we completed it you need to think about that in factoring the us model recognizing obviously that is a specialty on mail business with different dynamics in terms of the international businesses i think as weve said in the prepared remarks there is still the challenge in the uk with the nhs having cut the reimbursement that will continue the basis has performed robustly as we said over key customer period but retailing is still itself quite challenging particularly in the uk which is our largest market and then on wholesale sales wholesale always a its kind of business or division that operates in a number of markets you can always get certain mix affect quarterbyquarter so its tough to model i know quarterbyquarter but i did point out in the prepared remarks that in certain of the emerging markets we had some growth really in the period when you get price changes in the market where people tend to buy ahead of customers buy ahead of the price change and that was the notable impact in the second quarter alex gourlay and it’s alex again just really quickly on the uk as george has said the reimbursement pressure was the main reason for the decline really there was two things government did one they normally do which is they buy margin which is normal in the uk contract but secondly this year on december they actually remove some of the service payments practice payments and again if you look on new deals you’ll see that’s a big issue in the uk so that really is the reason why we’ve had our increases and operating profit these two business had a good december and that we’re focusing and controlling our costs it’s really driving as we always do you need a bit of products particularly in beauty and some marketplace and developing new pharmacy services so we’re looking to stabilize our business but the impacts or the government action has been strongly share our main uk business alvin concepcion great thanks for the color and just a quick followup on the beauty initiatives and the remodel just wanted to get an update on what you’ve seen from those if you’ve seen an uplift of comps not only beauty section but also the overall store and some these mover of markets and if so could you quantify that at all alex gourlay hi alex again i mean really it so wildly on the  stores if you would call we had about a marketplace in phoenix which we tested and trials i mean took the best model and remained that really last year into the first  stores so far so good we’re seeing that the beauty brand is growing we should expect it to do and over time we’ll develop you know the offer in the marketing around that new beauty offering but this trial is to tell the affect that is going to have on the rest of our business but we remain confident and will have a positive impact alvin concepcion thank you very much operator our next question is from david larsen of leerink your line is open david larsen hi can you talk a bit about how you’re going to roll up the prime partnership into your pl so like for example obviously with this  billion contract that prime just won in specialty like how much of that is going to flow through your pl like when we think about central fill for specialty i guess what portion of specialty would that be any kind color there would be great thanks george fairweather well just on the accounting side i mean we will account for it on a fully consolidated basis so when youre looking at our of sales our adjusted operating income then you will obviously see a  of the entities results coming through but then when youre actually looking at an earnings attributable to our shareholders to the wba shareholders we strip out and align the proportion that is attributable to prime itself and i think as we said we own just over  of the business so when you thinking of eps then it will be our share if you thinking of operating its a  also in the accounting books david larsen that’s great so for fep win that  billion in revenue all of that is going to flow through onto your pl and then if they win say mail in a year or so that would also all flow through into your pl that full  billion or  billion for now and  billion or  billion for specialty for revenue george fairweather anything that goes through the venture that the new combined venture as to say we show a  in revenue  in adjusted operating income but then we strip as i say at the lower end of the pl that the prime share so when we are looking at adjusted earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance staffs got their share netted out david larsen okay great and then i think prime uses wbad as well right through adc so the valueadd or pitch to managed care clients is both  i mean theres a significant cogs benefit there i would imagine right for the managed care… stefano pessina we cannot comment on that we cannot comment on the contact that prime have or well have david larsen okay thanks congrats on a good quarter operator thank you our next question is from scott mushkin of wolfe research your line is open scott mushkin hi thanks guys most of my questions have been answered but i just had one regarding the us profitability in the pharmacy as we look out you know if the rite aid deal does not get approved how should we frame it as we move out over the next year or two or three with all these contracts that has been signed specifically the profitability of the pharmacy alex gourlay hi scott it’s alex here again as we have been really clear we are independently working hard on our pharmacy strategy independent already and we feel very confident with the network we have already is strong enough to be very competitive in the marketplace anything that we achieve when the ftc gave a decision to approve rite aid will be incremental as george has indicated in the eps numbers and also in terms of the synergies we announced as part of the deal stefano pessina and also you will appreciate that we will not be able to integrate all the stores of rite aid overnight there will be a period portfolio of certain number of years where we will have to rely mainly on our stores and in the meantime we will integrate all the stores of rite aid so you cannot see the effect immediately scott mushkin right and then looking at the frontend obviously the beauty part of it seems to be working out that well and i just want to clarify do you see another  stores are going to get the enhance beauty between now and the end of the year i just want to make sure is that number correct gerald gradwell yes its roughly under  just now and it moves up to roughly  over a state of just under – were going to see just approaching  so  will have this by the end of this – really the end of the summer effectively scott mushkin okay and then any thoughts on what those stores do in comparison to the rest i think you are a negative  comp on the chain but those stores perform   basis point better any parameters you have on that gerald gradwell no again its really early on and the way we measure this really is about the underlying retail margin the operating margin in particular and the more we see increases relatively speaking in beauty care and healthcare but in the beauty care the more we see the retail underlying margin improving over time in a sustainable way we are working around id say the rest of the model as stefano said in his opening remarks we are changing this model in quite a torrid time in the us for market changes so we are very pleased with the progress we are making but thats how we measure it scott mushkin so then my final one is pretty good quarter considering all the headwinds that the business faced as we look out over the next  to  months do you see any change in the headwinds that the business is facing do you think its abating is there any light at the end of the tunnel or is it going to continue to be this difficult as you move through the next  to  months and thats it for me thanks stefano pessina well there are headwinds but we hope that we will be able to have also some tailwinds and so we hope that at the end we will be able to deliver what we have promised gerald gradwell i would just reiterate if you just think of the guidance that weve given we have maintained our guidance today if you do the maths then that implies to  to  yearoveryear growth and that includes approximately a  headwind for currency so if you exclude the headwind and obviously currency can go one way or the other but if you exclude the headwind then the guidance implies  to  yearoveryear growth and underlying adjusted eps so i think that really i think gives us strong indication of what our thinking is and what we see how the businesses is performing overall and as we said at the start of the year this would be a more second half weighted in the year the first quarter second quarter has come out very much in line with our expectation so thats really how were thinking about how the business is performing at the moment scott mushkin perfect guys thanks for taking my questions operator our next question is from ajay jain of pivotal research group your line is open ajay jain hi thanks for taking the question most of my questions have been answered already but i just wanted to clarify why you feel like you have more flexibility i think in your prepared remarks you tied together the new buyback program would be the latest rite aid developments maybe i am reading too much into it but did the earlier comments just reflect any  do they reflect any greater or less confidence in a merger going through or is the flexibility just a function of the lower offering price for rite aid gerald gradwell the flexibility is simply obviously the lower price and the timing i mean weve been very clear that in terms of our policy is solid investment grade we worked very closely with the credit agencies as you would expect which is important for our debt investors and with the timing of the transaction with the revise consideration and with  what continues to be a very strong cash flows i think you’ve seen again from this quarters results that simply is why weve decided to announce what is the relatively modest buyback program its fine tuning is how i would describe it ajay jain great thank you operator thank you at this time im showing no further questions id like to turn the call back over to mr gerald for any closing remarks gerald gradwell thank you very much indeed ladies and gentlemen thank you for our calls sorry for the technical problems we had at the beginning but i believe you could all hear after we restarted so thank you very much indeed and the ir team are available to take all and answer any questions you might have in the coming days weeks months whatever and we will look forward to talking to you again next quarter thank you very much indeed copyright policy all transcripts on this site are the

relations website for reconciliations to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures and related information in a second i’ll hand over to george to take us through the third quarter results stefano will then cover today’s rite aid announcement in addition to his usual quarterly update after the prepared comments we will of course be happy to answer questions on both the results and on new rite aid agreement i’ll now hand you over to george george fairweather thank you gerald overall we are pleased with our progress this quarter with results in line with our expectations as in the last quarter we were particularly pleased with growth in us pharmacy volume and market share during the quarter we also completed the  billion share buyback program which we discussed on our last earnings call im also pleased that today we have raised the lower end of our adjusted earnings per share guidance for fiscal year  by  so now lets look at the financial highlights for the quarter as we expected currency again had a negative impact the us dollar being  stronger versus sterling than in the comparable quarter last year sales for the quarter were  billion up  versus the comparable quarter on a constant currency basis sales were up  gaap operating income was  billion a decrease of  gaap net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance were  billion up  and diluted eps was  up  adjusted operating income was  billion up  and in constant currency was up  adjusted net earnings attributable to walgreens boots alliance were  billion up  and in constant currency up  these percentage increases were higher than for adjusted operating income this was due to a lower tax rate partially offset by losses on certain legacy investments which adversely impacted both earnings from other equity method investments and other income since the quarterend we have disposed of the legacy investment the gain on which will largely offset these losses the adjusted effective tax rate which we calculate excluding the adjusted equity income from amerisourcebergen was  this was lower than in the comparable quarter last year primarily due to relatively high incremental discrete net tax benefits and a lower estimated core annual tax rate of  all of this resulted in adjusted diluted net earnings per share of  up  and in constant currency up  for completeness here are the numbers for the first nine months of fiscal  i will not go through those in great detail but you will note that gaap diluted net earnings per share was  up  versus the same period a yearago adjusted diluted net earnings per share was  up  and up  on a constant currency basis so let me now turn to the performance of our divisions in the quarter beginning with retail pharmacy usa retail pharmacy usa sales were  billion up  over the yearago quarter this included two months of results from alliancerx walgreens prime a recently formed central specialty and mail services business comparable store sales for the division increased by  adjusted gross profit was  billion down  reflecting a decrease in pharmacy partially offset by an increase in retail well look at this in more detail in a moment adjusted sga for the division was  of sales an improvement of  percentage points this improvement was primarily due to sales mix and higher sales as well as an amendment to certain employee postretirement benefits and our cost transformation program adjusted operating margin was  in line with the comparable quarter last year resulting in adjusted operating income of  billion up  so next lets look in more detail at pharmacy us pharmacy total sales were up  versus the yearago quarter mainly due to higher prescription volumes including mail and central specialty during the quarter we filled  million prescriptions on a day adjusted basis including immunizations an increase of  on a comparable basis for stores which exclude central specialty and mail pharmacy sales increased by  with scripts filled up  in the second quarter we reported our highest quarterly growth rate in over seven years this quarter was even better growth was primarily due to strong volume growth from medicare part d and the positive impact of our strategic pharmacy partnerships within sales volume growth and brand inflation were partially offset by reimbursement pressure and the impact of generics this pressure contributed to lower pharmacy gross profit and gross margin a higher proportion of specialty adversely impacted pharmacy gross margin by around  basis points however the higher specialty sales had a positive impact on gross profit our reported retail prescriptions market share on the usual day adjusted basis was  up by approximately  basis points over the yearago quarter this was the highest market share that we have ever reported total retail sales were down  on the same quarter last year this included the impact of the previously announced closure of certain ecommerce operations comparable retail sales were down  with declines in the consumables and general merchandise category and in the personal care category partially offset by solid growth in the health and wellness and beauty categories adjusted gross profit was higher primarily due to mix and underlying margin improvement beauty category performance and beauty differentiation stores continues to be markedly better than in other stores supported by strong sales growth of no and soap  glory we have also continued to introduce new brands into our existing beauty differentiation locations including botanics which i mentioned last quarter we remain on track to introduce our enhanced beauty offering to over  additional stores by the end of the calendar year this quarter as part of our strategy and ongoing cost transformation we have also begun to implement a program in certain stores to simplify our offering and improve our retail operational performance this is designed to deliver a better experience for our customers provide ongoing efficiencies and reduce working capital in the coming months we expect this program to reach approximately  stores so now lets look at the results for the retail pharmacy international division sales for the division were  billion down  in constant currency versus the yearago quarter comparable store sales increased  in constant currency comparable pharmacy sales were down  on a constant currency basis mainly due to a decline in the uk in boots uk comparable pharmacy sales were down  mainly due to the reduction in government pharmacy funding comparable retail sales for the division increased  boots uk’s comparable retail sales increasing  within this beauty was boots uk’s strongest category assisted by the launch of no restore  renew face  neck multiaction serum adjusted gross profit for the division at  billion was down  in constant currency versus the yearago quarter mainly due to lower pharmacy gross margin adjusted sga as a percentage of sales on a constant currency basis was  percentage points higher at  mainly due to inflationary pressures and higher variable payroll costs adjusted operating margin was  down  percentage points in constant currency this resulted in adjusted operating income of  million a decrease of  again in constant currency i am delighted to report that in april the first boots franchise store opened in south korea this is in line with our strategy of expanding boots retail presence in asia south korea is a highly sophisticated beauty market particularly for cosmetics and it’s strategically important for sourcing innovative products so now lets look at our pharmaceutical wholesale division sales for the division were  billion up  versus the same quarter last year on a constant currency basis comparable sales on a constant currency basis were up  this was ahead of the companys estimated market growth weighted on the basis of country wholesale sales with growth in emerging markets and the uk partially offset by challenging market conditions in continental europe adjusted operating margin which excludes abc was  down  percentage points on a constant currency basis but in line with the second quarter adjusted operating income was  million up  in constant currency excluding adjusted equity earnings from abc adjusted operating income was up  in constant currency so turning next to capital allocation operating cash flow in the quarter was  billion during the quarter our working capital inflow was  million this primarily reflected improvements in inventories both in the quarter and yearonyear cash capital expenditure in the quarter was  million we continue to invest in our core customer proposition including our stores and us beauty program as well as the upgrades to our it systems which we have previously talked about overall this resulted in free cash flow in the quarter of  billion with a total of  billion in the year to date turning next to our guidance for fiscal  we have raised the lower end of our guidance and now anticipate adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of  to  remember this guidance assumes current exchange rates remaining constant for the rest of the fiscal year i will now hand over to stefano for his concluding comments stefano pessina thank you george i will turn first to the new rite aid agreement which we announced this morning when we first began discussion with rite aid it was with a vision of increasing our network and our population coverage it quickly became clear that if we could start with the transaction appropriately potentially greater benefit could be gained by bringing the two entire companies together through an acquisition however given the changes in the market that during the longerthanexpected federal trade commission review process and the ongoing uncertainty about the potential outcome we have decided after detailed discussion with rite aid not to continue to review the acquisition of the old company instead we have today announced the proposed purchase of  stores from rite aid together with warehouses and inventory to support those stores while we are assuming the real estate obligation we are not assuming any debt in addition the deal is also expected to give significant cash tax benefit as we tax amortize the intangible assets we acquired this transaction though smaller than the original is due to our original strategic aim and i believe simpler to deliver both operationally and financially overall i view this deal as being more attractive than the transaction it replaces recognizing the adjustments and compromises that we have had to make since the original deal was announced in what continues to be a challenging market for pharmacy we expect that this new smaller deal will deliver synergies in excess of  million per annum within three to four years of the initial closing and be modestly accretive to adjusted earnings per share in the first fullyear after the initial closing importantly the stores we are proposing to purchase are more than enough to create the potential opportunity for optimization of our expanded network and in doing so the opportunity to create greater efficiency above and beyond the synergies that deal is expected to deliver in addition the deal is structured in such a way as to offer opportunities for additional benefits over time in constructing this new agreement we have endeavored to address all the substantive regulatory points raised about the original transaction we believe that this will enable us to complete the transaction in a timely manner and drive forward with our plans to further grow our company i am pleased to have once again being proved right in my firm belief that as the english say where there is a will there is a way that two willing partners can despite adversity find a deal that delivers true benefits for both given that significantly lower cost of the new transaction i am pleased that today we have been able also to keep our commitment to our investors that we will not maintain an inefficient balance sheet longer than is absolutely necessary this is why we are planning to return the surplus cash that we are carrying on the balance sheet beyond that’s required for the new proposed transaction to our shareholders through a new  billion share repurchase program this is in addition to the  billion program which we initiated and completed during our third quarter on completion of this new program we will resume our regular reviews of capital deployment design it to ensure that excess capital where appropriate is used as directly as possible to improve shareholder value of course today our new proposed transaction with rite aid is not our only news as george said we are seeing progress in many areas of our business in the quarter we are reviewing it today and this has been achieved in an environment when we have seen continued competitive pressure challenging markets and regulatory uncertainty naturally there is nothing new in these but it means we must remain focused to ensure our business is meeting the needs of the market and to maintain our stronger position we are working with our strategic partners to maximize our own role in the healthcare system while at the same time providing the right services at the right price to support those partners in their task of being efficient and relevant the merger that created walgreens boots alliance and the subsequent restructuring and realigning of our business was an important step in the process as we are coming to a successful conclusion of that process of confirmation we must look again at the company to understand and identify the next course for us to make sure the business is the right structure shape and size and with the right skills indiscernible truly the leader on the opportunities that change offers our proposed transaction with rite aid would form a partner of this but only part we continue to see many opportunities both inside the business and potentially outside with other strategic partners and other partnerships we should be with no doubt that this is where my focus is working with my entire team to identify the next step for the business and ensuring whatever we do advances our place in the market is important for our customers and our strategic partner delivers clear direction for our people and of course provides an attractive opportunity to deliver meaningful growth and create true value for our shareholders it is obvious to us that the pressures on healthcare role and by extension pharmacy will continue within the healthcare market we face the range of strong competitor we each have our own business model at times that may give them certain advantages over us but at other times we believe it gives us meaningful strength and advantages over them managing our company for growth in these markets is a core role of the executive team and we are never complacent about our position in the market or the competition we face current and potential remember also that new participants in the market also provide the opportunity for new partnership and collaboration change brings opportunity as well as challenges we continue to forge and to strengthen strategic partnerships that are delivering real benefits for our businesses today especially in the us where we are seeing volumes returning to our pharmacies and opportunities arising that enhance both our retail and healthcare offerings these will open paths for us to new services with new sources of potential revenue and income over time so as you have heard overall we believe it has been a recent report where some progress have been made as a result we are raising the lower end of our guidance for the year as a whole we do however continue to experience some very challenging markets and as ive said we expect these challenges to continue and these may possibly difficult in the months and years to come we are completing a phase of our business where we were very much focused on driving the optimum benefit from the merger that created the walgreens boots alliance in this phase we have delivered far more both in terms of efficiencies and cost than we had originally anticipated while we continue to careful and methodical work to drive efficiency and excellence across our business we are beginning to look at the next phase of the evolution of our company we believe this next phase will mainly be focused on walgreens and on the structure and merchandising of our retail operation which will be intended to deliver further savings and create real value from within the business building on the sound corporate discipline we are exercising the exceptional presence we have across the world and the ability that gives us to reach people at that time and place convenient to them we have an excellent opportunity to be a cornerstone in the healthcare system we work within and a cornerstone of the communities we serve as you have heard from george we have opened our first boots franchise stores in south korea and we continue to look to expand the geographic presence of our business including increasing our presence in asia particularly china with more of a focus on retail in these markets than we have had up to now it is all too easy to allow the reasonable and important focus on quarterly performance as a measure of progress to distract us from our longerterm opportunities but i am confident in my belief that the challenges we face along the way are more stepping stones than obstacles to the longerterm growth of our company in the months and years ahead i will now hand you over to gerald so that we can answer any questions you may have thank you now i will hand you back to gerald gerald gradwell thank you stefano id now like to ask candace our operator to open the lines for questions please questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from ross muken of evercore isi your line is now open elizabeth anderson hi this is elizabeth anderson in for ross today congratulations on the deal that you announced today and i was just wondering if you could talk about one the – sort of the profit profile of some of the stores that you are looking to acquire and the attraction of that subcategory of stores and then two more generally speaking could you talk a little bit more about some of the additional partnerships you guys have been considering and sort of the assets that you guys bring to the table and what sort of things you think might be particularly helpful thanks alexander gourlay hi elizabeth good morning it’s alex here yes the profit profile first of all of the stores we’re acquiring is more or less the average profile of rite aid maybe slightly less but more or less the same and also the same investment profile you know that’s already have been investing well in their wellness format and again these stores have got the same profile as the stores that we’re retaining so we feel pretty good about that and they’re mainly doing fillingph in the northeast the midatlantic and the southern eastern regions to give us more presence in these regions and pretty obviously as the service of walgreens over time can get to customers and patients in these areas so we feel good about that core of stores we’re acquiring we think they are good value for us and it will really really improve our network particularly in the regions that i mentioned in terms of partnerships i think we – you also yesterday saw we announced our partnership with labcorp which we’re really pleased with seven store trials called labcorp at walgreens and adds on to the partnerships that weve announced in the past particularly with clinics across the many healthcare systems in the us and how we see this working both from a space usage point of view a convenience indiscernible through our pharmacy and then linking into the various it systems and technologies that we have we really see this will drive not just cost reduction for us but real convenience and access for customers and ultimately of course more volume descriptions for us over time in more healthcare and pharmacy services we’ve made good progress in the last couple of years with the strategy theres more to come and as long as it fits from a customer point of view next to our pharmacy and as long as it makes sense to reduce the costs in the healthcare system we will continue to test and trial and roll out these services elizabeth anderson perfect thanks that’s really helpful operator thank you and our next question comes from ricky goldwasser of morgan stanley your line is now open ricky goldwasser yes good morning thank you so stefano you talked about looking at kind of the next phase of the evolution of the company and it sounds like partially its focused on the retail side and merchandising but also on the healthcare side so can you talk a little bit about – give us more color on how you think of expanding walgreens role in the delivery of healthcare and are you thinking about it from a partnership model similar to what you signed with labcorp – what you announced with labcorp yesterday or are you also kind of considering opportunities where you can deploy capital especially when we think about kind of like the whole concept of vertical integration that’s discussed in the marketplace stefano pessina well i have spoken of a second phase of development in our company we see when we merged of course our focus was on synergies and our focus was on cutting cost and as you have seen we have been consistent with what we were saying and we have really achieved the level of synergies and the level of cost reductions substantially earlier than promised and at the end of this year we will have for sure better numbers then even we were expecting so now as i said many times the integration of the company and the improvement of a new company go through different phases now we have done the first phase and we have other phases and in each phase that we will be able to reduce cost and probably to find additional synergies for the time being we have rationalized the company we have gone through the most evident cost reduction that we could see we have improved our procurement and we have tried to buy better or to exploit the possibilities that we had due to our scale and our geographic expansion and now we have to go back and refine the work that we have done and of course now our focus will be mainly on walgreens and mainly on the stores of course we have done important things in the stores we have improved the supply chains we have changed or started to change the mindset of people focusing more on the customers we have started to collect information and data on our customers in order to understand better what they wanted and what we could do for them and now its time to put all these things together and to reorganize our stores in that direction we have to understand exactly which kind of categories are really of interest for our customers because its not particularly useful to us a bit of everything if people are not really appreciating it and so we said that we are really focusing more on beauty on health and beauty particularly and so we have started as you have seen now we have started to rollout more products we have started to test many models but now it’s time to really go back and really put in act  put in the stores so all the experience that we have done in these two years and these will be the focus of the second phase of the development part of this for sure is the logic of having other players with us in our stores because we have space we will get more space with the rationalization of the stores and we have to use this space for trying to give a better experience to our customers and so that we have trialing many different partnerships and most of those trials have been successful and we have to hold them out over time the combination of these two things will give a new look to our stores which is what we need and what we had really what was really in our strategy from the very first moment but we had to create the platform the basis in order to build these transformation of the stores and after we will have another phase a third phase which will be based on technology we are making big investments big efforts in updating – upgrading our technology we will have a completely new system in a few years maybe few years in the next i would say many months and at that point we would be able to make another jump in the organization of our stores and this will be the third phase this is exactly what we told you i would say from the very beginning or at least in the last two years and this is the program that we are following alex do you want to add something alexander gourlay no i think i’m really pleased – just one that’s – i think it was mentioned in the prepared remarks were really moving into phase beyond the beauty differentiation phase of simplifying the core offer and we’re just trying to roll out up to  stores by the end of this year so it’s another important step in the phase ii as stefano described so this is very active its very real in the business and we continue to drive that model forward and the idea of this one really is to simplify these stores and specially extend that customers can find products more easily and we can edit the products on their behalf using the data that we have been collecting in the last three or four years so were not slowing down here were actually speeding up is the main point i want to add to stefano’s description of the activity ricky goldwasser okay and just one followup on the guide one is for the guide for the rest of the year and the other one within the context of this comments how should we think about the growth algorithm going forward so for the guide for the remaining quarter does the increased guidance include the buyback program and are you going to see any benefit from taxes next quarter and then when we think kind of like longer term to  and beyond do you think that given kind of like the competitive environment in the marketplace but also your efforts to kind of like simplify the offering and sounds like potentially maybe narrowing the skus do you think that you can sustain doubledigit eps growth now that you know what the rite aid deal would look like george fairweather okay i’ll try and take some of those in the right order if i start perhaps with just the tax as i said in the prepared comments the core tax rate was  and then this quarter if you look back historically we had a relatively high number of discrete positives clearly very significantly quarterbyquarter as you can see going back historically and as i say you can see this was a relatively high number but i think in terms of the core tax rate and helping you with the model the  that you see it today is clearly under us gaap or the rate that we would anticipate at this point for the core tax element for the fullyear just in terms of buyback program clearly weve announced the program just today and i think – and just in thinking about modeling clearly we’re pretty well the end of june now so we’ve really only got a couple of months to go to the yearend so theres not really long for any impact where we to choose to commence that program any impact will be relatively modest obviously our guidance as ever is all in but again as i said in the prepared comments it is of course assuming currency exchange rates for the balance of the fiscal year alexander gourlay this is alex here we are confident from an operational point of view that we can get to that number at the end of the year and continue to drive the strategy that stefano described so clearly so you’ll see through our numbers the volume in pharmacy continues to be as we expect it strong as the partnerships and we made a slight improvement but an important improvement in the underlying sales growth in the front end and the margin in the front end continues to be accretive yearonyear and cost control is good so we remain confident that we can get that done gerald gradwell if i could just again ask people to speak up and speak clearly when theyre asking the questions we can’t answer questions we can’t here properly thank you next question stefano pessina i would add something what we are trying to do at the end we said from the very beginning our aim is to keep the adjusted operating margin as healthy as possible and you have seen that in spite of all the difficulties of the market over the last years we have been successful in doing that and we hope that we will continue to be able to do this there are many ways in which you can derive the numbers and the success of a company and we are really focused on these metric we know that there are always additional opportunities to buy better additional opportunities to be more efficient and not just to cut costs for the sake of cutting cost but to be more efficient and so we accept that the market is a very challenging market that we have worked in challenging market for decades we know that this will be our environment in future and as we have done for the past we will really try to compensate and to respond to the challenges of the market through other actions that we can implement and we have always implemented successfully operator thank you and our next question comes from lisa gill of jpmorgan your line is now open lisa gill hi great good morning and thank you stefano you talked about challenges and opportunities and talked about different new partnerships that will come about obviously theres been a lot of talk about amazon and then potentially getting into the pharmacy market do you view that as a potential opportunity to walgreens or a potential challenge as we move forward stefano pessina well lets say that i see everything as an opportunity and not because i am an optimist but just because we have demonstrated in the past that we can survive in an environment having side so honestly i dont believer that amazon will – the interest in the near future in the next few years in these market because they have so many opportunities around world and in many other categories which are much much simpler than healthcare which is very regulated business and also its a business which in industry where the consolidation has been really quite significant so there is not a lot of new things that they could do of course they could but not so many as they could do in other markets so as they are a very good team and very rational team i believe that at the end this will not be their priority having said so if we were wrong and our belief was wrong i believe that at the end of the day we could find our goal in the new environment and we wouldn’t exclude to partner with them we wouldn’t exclude to analyze the new situation of the market and to find our place adapting ourselves so honestly i have seen the emotional reaction about the move that amazon has done with whole foods but i have found these reaction as i said emotional and with all due respect not rational because if you analyze things accordingly you will see that this is not the best opportunity for amazon and you would see that the market has changed so many times in the past and the big players in this market have survived so better luck we will continue to survive in any case lisa gill great and then my second followup and i agree with you and i think that a lot of prescriptions sell today are medicare part d and i think thats where my followup question is for alex as we think about bringing on the new  stories from rite aid does that help to strengthen any of your part d preferred networks number one and number two i know its really early to think about part d networks as im sure the negotiations are going on right now but do you anticipate many changes for  alexander gourlay obviously yes i think clearly having more pharmacies in certain markets will improve access for medicare d for sure and that’s something that we contemplated in terms of the partnerships we have so this makes us slightly more attractive i dont think it fundamentally changes the prices paid to be honest it just makes us more attractive in certain markets all will certainly help in terms of the market itself we continue to have strong partnerships which you see that much of our volume beyond the new partnerships with the prime and express scripts have been driven by med d this year and we continue to operate well in that market with a target from three or four years ago there has been some changes and that will continue to occur and well continue to govern these changes properly to make sure that we are paying within the prices that we think is right for the service that we provide so we remain very confident about our position in the marketplace very confident about the prices we have and continue to govern what we get paid as best we can under the reimbursement pressure that stefano has described lisa gill thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from michael cherny of ubs your line is now open michael cherny good morning everyone and thank you for the details so far so i want to dive a little bit into further the us retail pharmacy gross profit as you think going forward when you talked about the reimbursement pressures can you maybe just qualitatively give some sense of what could be some positive contributors to gross profit dollar growth within the us retail pharmacy and then versus the reimbursement change we have now what could be some additional headwinds that you could expect to see i guess over the next one two three maybe five years even alexander gourlay hi michael yes it’s alex here so i think as george said in his prepared remarks we are in the early stages of our new relationship with rx alliance walgreens prime and that will be accretive in terms of dollars over time although as we all know specialty is a highsales and lowpercent margin business but that will be accretive and its a very important market in the us and were pleased with the progress made although its very early days in this partnership but you will have noted that we were able to win the fep contract as one example of the attractiveness of this new model in the marketplace in terms of other gross dollar opportunities going forward it is more difficult to see in the network side of the stage to be honest theres more headwinds as you can see in the retail pharmacy gross profit as stefano said quite clearly we’re used to living with these headwinds and our strategy here has been very clearly to do three things one is to increase our volume to make better use of our network secondly is to improve our buying capability which again you can see very clearly and also thirdly is to really make sure that we work with other healthcare services to improve the overall gross profit dollars we’ve got and the major aim of all of these activities is to make sure that we focus on the bottom line the operating profit at the end of the day is i think is the most important to us so that’s how see it and i think we see that continued pressure more headwinds and tailwinds and we continue to work all these levers to improve our operating profit and you’ll see in this quarter we improved our operating profit in the us by  as i think as one example of it michael cherny excellent thanks so much operator thank you and our next question comes from steven valiquette of bank of america merrill lynch your line is now open steven valiquette hey good morning just congrats on the new deal with rite aid a quick question really just simply is that just given the lengthy ftc review of the original proposed rite aid merger it’s safe to say that youre now obviously pretty familiar with these specific hotbutton topics at the ftc but when you do look at the store maps in the rite aid slides it does look like the stores youre trying to buy do still seem to have a decent amount of overlap with existing walgreens stores at least on a statebystate basis so i guess im just trying to think here should we assume that the new plan takes into account feedback from the ftc such that youre highly confident in a shorter ftc review for the new asset purchase or could this still be a battle with the ftc even for the new plan thanks stefano pessina okay so general counsel who might answer that okay marco pagni yes hi good morning we should assume that we have taken a kind of specific feedback from the agency that we have received over the last  odd months in formulating store package that we have agreed with rite aid and – but beyond that i wouldnt care to express any level of confidence one way or another as to how the transaction will proceed obviously the matter is before the regulator but i can tell you that we have designed it in a way which has been very carefully thought through with rite aid with our consul to take a kind of all the feedback that we received during the last  months of a very detailed review process stefano pessina alex do you want to comment on the question of the overlap and whatever else alexander gourlay yes as i said before operationally we really like the spread of these stores they really give – we get in some new markets locally we are able to really intensify our presence for patients and customers in these markets and of course once we get into the next phase will understand more how we can really operationalized and make the whole areas more efficient but i think we’ve agreed operationally with the coverage in these new markets stefano pessina it’s stefano here yes as we said initially we were thinking of buying a certain stores and after discussing with i think i am talking off two years ago of course we decided that the best outcome for both company was to go to a merger and we were thinking at the time of course and following the advice of the specialists that the merger could go through without major issues these are not being the case at a certain point that we have actually a good deal in order to address some concerns of the ftc also these new deals if they can – as you have seen a lot of time and at the certain point we have decided that to get this variety that to go back to the old idea and to buy a certain number of stores of course in doing that we had – and we have to take into account and then needs of both companies so because if the rite aid sell – decide to sell certain stores they have to do eat in a way that the remaining company can be efficient and can overall take into account the money that they will receive overall can be better than before and from our side we have to buy those stores which are feeling certain gap that we have in our network and in other cases are strengthen our position in other states so this has been a thoughtful lets say deal as marco said taking to account all the objections that we could imagine from the ftc this is just an asset deal but also taking that into account that our needs and the needs of rite aid because they have to come out from this deal as a stronger company and we have selected a cluster of stores in certain states where we needed them but we could not really cover all of our gap because these would have left rite aid in a situation which operationally would not be particularly efficient so this is really the best possible deal between our two companies and i strongly believe strongly believe that this is a deal which is a very good for us because we get probably  –  of what we wanted as national coverage and is very good for rite aid because they come out from this deal as a stronger company and with a company which can be very efficient operationally steven valiquette okay that’s helpful color thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from charles rhyee of cowen  company your line is now open charles rhyee yes thanks for taking the question just curious about also just staying with the ftc issue and in terms of some of the concerns they might have had leading up to todays announcement i understand what youre saying in terms of this is more of a simple asset deal but if i miss – youve giving them an option to buy generic drugs through wbad and it looks like from the rite aid slides for a period of  years can you talk about how the ftc might view that kind of more strategic alliance on the purchasing side and you think that perhaps presents a different kind of hindrance thanks stefano pessina marco marco pagni yes charles this is marco pagni here again we’re not able to comment on how the ftc may or may not see any particular facet of this transaction but i would say is that it  its important that the rite aid going forward be competitive in the market and clearly its an option to join our procurements vehicle wbad will help it but that’s cost of goods going forward which we believe is important for its competitive position in the market and i express the view as to how the ftc will see that but one could imagine that might be important for them stefano pessina and in any cases its an option so they can exercise it or not so it is not a mandatory part of the deal charles rhyee great and if i could just followup one other question with alex you talked in the beginning about stores with the new beauty differentiation having – doing better can you give us a sense in terms of comparison to the stores that have not the restructuring in that sense what the differential in performance might be alexander gourlay hi charles no i think as we stated in markedly better particularly expects in beauty and especially driving the beauty category very well in the stores so we are pleased with the performance of beauty it’s really coming through quite strongly we can imagine the beauty is still a relatively i wouldn’t say small but its not as big a part of our business for example as a consumable side of a business we are continuing to refocus on a more profitable promotions and refocus on seasonal lines which endtoend actually loses money and taken in from our ranges so i think you have to look at the whole mix so we are very confident thats why were rolling it to another  stores were also very confident in our partnerships with other companies for example next has been rolled out thats a loreal brand it’s a very good brand growing right now is well into the beauty differentiated stores and we continue to see a lot of customers signing up to a beauty enthusiast cards so again the whole model that’s driving forward and we continue to see the growth coming in beauty that we had hoped to see so thats where we are and i think obviously will more news as we get deeper into the state and as we get more grand and more beauty customers getting more interested in doing more of their beauty shopping in walgreens charles rhyee great thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from eric percher of barclays your line is now open eric percher thank you stefano i want to return to your comment on this transaction being more attractive than the original deal if we look at the cost per store its much lower that would seem to be a clear benefit the amount of debt youll issue and id be curious to what extent the fact that you have a lower leverage in your ability to execute on the strategy that come next plays a role in that that observation that its more attractive and then last as we look at i think you just said recently  to  of national coverage how much of the benefit is achieved via coverage and the ability to offer your partners more coverage versus the density needed to obtain operating efficiencies and synergies from the stores stefano pessina well on the deal yes i said that this is a more attractive deal not because the other deals were bad the other deals were good and we believe the other deal but of course after we have to make a lot of compromises and at the end of the day the deal were different from the deals that we had in mind so this deal it’s much simpler its an asset deal so it’s less controversial – much less controversial we dont take practically any liability you can imagine that as part of the deal we have just talked and we have the tax savings that we will find amortizing the goodwill at least cash wise if you think that the amortization of the goodwill is on  pharmacies practically and the inventory is on  pharmacies plus three quite big warehouses you will see that we have a strong cash element in this deal already there so it’s clear that economically and thinking of the ir this deal is very good on the other side this is not a bad deal i believe not at all its a good deal also for rite aid because at the end we dont have to give any part of the value to third parties so in reality the two parties are better off and about our coverage well its very important that we have a complete coverage we were relatively weak on the east coast so this was our main objective particularly in the northeast because its a very rich region and it’s a region where its relatively easy to work so this was our main thoughts we would like to have a few  stores more on the west coast yes of course we would like it even though we are present there but there are certain spots of southern california and maybe the state of washington where we would like to have a more stores but at the end of the day our presence there is already better than the present that we had in the northeast so if we had to choose by far we prefer to be stronger now and very present in the northeast even because as you know california is not an easy state for us and for everybody to work in the healthcare so i believe that we are very happy what we have achieved and its important that we have this coverage because its important to be able to offer a wide coverage to our customers and its also important for us because we have a better basis to amortize our cost and we have a better basis to sell our products alex alexander gourlay hi eric at this point of coverage being the operating efficiencies there’s both but i would say there is probably more in the operating efficiencies side again if you think of all we’ve achieved with walgreens and also think of the ambition as stefano described very well in an earlier question to simplify and make the front end more efficient and more differentiated once we have done that in the first phase of it simplicity well be able to plugin all these stores into that platform so i think there’s a lot to go at in the operating efficiencies probably more than the coverage site in reality eric percher so that said george im surprised theres not more than modest accretion are you assuming any inventory writedowns or other elements that will weigh on that and how should we think about the synergy buckets here george fairweather i think in terms of the accretion what we said is modest accretion in the first fullyear and i think thats important to take away and we’re very clear on the synergies that we can deliver the  million over three to four years weve got a very clear path to delivering it and i think one of our approaches to acquisition integration is one where we have very detailed plans we take it in a very structured way so that we do things smoothly we are going to be obviously – actually acquiring those stores over a period of time as weve explained in the announcement and then we will be rebranding those over time to walgreens bringing in the walgreens offer and that is not something that we would ever dream of actually big banging we need to do it properly so that we have the customer proposition is delivered in a consistent way as we do the rebranding so were very confident about the returns but whats important is to go in a straight line and do in a way where we keep the focus on the customer as we integrate the business on the service that we provide our patients rather than sometimes which you see dare i say i see in other businesses do where they rush things and they dont execute properly and i think you’ll have seen that consistently as with the merger of walgreens and alliance boots i think youll see weve got a very clear track record of doing that over time stefano pessina and you’ll see the main important thing looking at the accretion is that we will ramp up over time the transfer of the stores and in the first year we will have – it will be at a certain extent the most complicated year because we will have to start to do this transfer and we have said that the transfer will take a certain – probably two three years it cannot – if we want to do it in an orderly fashion if we want to do it without disruption if we want to keep the value what – at the end we will have both we have to do like that on the synergies we have said that we would have at least  million of synergies of course as you know and as we have always done in the past when we give a number for the synergies we take into account all the elements we are practically sure or very very confident but over time the experience tells us that we find other synergies and as you have seen we have – in the past at least we have exceeded what we were expecting because we cannot see all the potential synergies today until we dont understand exactly the nature of the stores that we will have both remember that for the time being we dont have the full set of numbers about on those stores and so we cannot see exactly which kind of synergies we can achieve and we have just taken the basic synergies that we are quite confident about eric percher thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from robert jones of goldman sachs your line is now open robert jones great thanks for the questions alex just wanted to go back to the us business and i know this is the same case last quarter but can you just help us understand a little bit better how despite the really strong script growth youve seen in the last two quarters that gross profit dollars were actually down again in the us business and i guess more importantly is there a timetable that youre thinking about as far as an inflection in gross profit dollar growth in the us business alexander gourlay hi robert it’s alex here yes i think all the drop yearonyear as george said in his prepared remarks about  basis points was due to specialty so there for the trend on the two quarters as you pointed it’s about the same that you ask a little bit worsening but not significantly worse and as i said already in another remark we are really focused on operating margin so therefore we drive – operating margin by driving volume through the fixed – primarily fixed cost base and again i wanted a big call it’s a teams who have handled that volume and the cost base as you see has been almost flat in reality giving a  more growth in the usa in this quarter so i think thats the model that we spoke about it before that’s the model that weve been executing recognizing as i’ve said consistently the reimbursement pressure is really – and whats driving really is market condition the consolidation really of the pbms in particular the downward pressure on pricing and thats a real effects that were seeing with less inflation on branded drugs and that’s clearly featured the marketplace this year in particular and we continue to see that going forward now we were used to this as stefano said and we used to managing in a certain way and were pleased with the progress of our cost of goods the wbab organization continues to perform well for us and we set a new partnership there with express we announced in may we continue to work on the cost base and the structure of the company and where stefano said already were moving into phase ii there and we have more opportunities there and we continue to work in partnership to make sure that we get the volume into that fixed cost base in the future so thats our focus it would be wrong we tell you that i see a time in the future when i see that the reimbursement pressure going away from its current levels as the market and we are operating an effective to be within our marketplace robert jones okay thats fair and then i guess george if you look at where the company will be post this transaction i think it looks like maybe somewhere in the  times leverage ratio on a rent adjusted basis is factoring the buyback as well can you just maybe share what the longterm leverage target is that youre comfortable with post the transaction george fairweather weve not published our longterm leverage target weve chosen as you know robert to talk about our commitment to solid investment grade and that’s very much what our policy as weve obviously because of the time is taken since the original announcement of the original rite aid transaction weve obviously been building up a lot of cash which is not something that we like doing were very committed to having an efficient balance sheet we have to do and that’s why today when weve announced the new transaction weve been probably announced the  billion share buyback program so were very committed to being financially disciplined to when were looking at ma we’re always very focused on the numbers if the numbers dont add up dont give meet our investment hurdles then were very disciplined we dont do transactions and so were very happy to grow organically and invest with to do ma when we get the right returns but equally a very clear policy of returning any surplus funds to shareholders within those parameters that ive explained having an efficient balance sheet very important to us robert jones great thanks so much operator thank you and our next question comes from brian tanquilut of jefferies your line is now open bryan ross hi this is bryan ross on for brian tanquilut congrats on the record script growth again for the second consecutive quarter my question is more when youre looking at these retail pharmacy contracts and networks as they come up and keeping in mind your goal to continue boosting volume through the stores do you get the sense that conversation with health plans or in payers are shifting more to these preferred networks like prime and tricare are you actively pursuing these type of networks moving forward alexander gourlay hi bryan it’s alex i would say its mixed i mean i think so first of all nothing is fundamentally changed yearonyear in the marketplace from what were seeing some peers prefer preferred networks and some preferred to have open access across the networks so i dont think theres anything fundamentally changing theres certainly a trend towards more preferred networks over time but that’s more accelerated or decelerated and we are in the marketplace we look at every partnership to understand what the payer requires of us and what we can bring to them and then we work through the government processes which are very tight in the business what is that we expect to be paid in the current marketplace for the services that we provide so we – that’s how we see it on the – it’s very active for us a very important part of our business and we try very deeply to understand what the marketplace and what the payers want from us and were not trying to drive in any direction we try and drive customer care and access and as such really our strategy bryan ross okay thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from scott mushkin of wolfe research your line is now open scott mushkin hey guys i just wanted to poke on a couple of things just want a clarification and then i want to poke on a couple of things so i think it was referenced that there was a change in the postretirement benefit that benefited costs if you guys could tell us how much that was and then whether that’s one time that would be really helpful marco pagni the postretirement changes is one of the – a number of changes that we are doing as we look to make sure that we have a clear remuneration policy that for all our employees that this was the change that affected our relatively small population of employee so its really part of an ongoing program were very focused on – in all aspects of compensation as well as all aspects of cost base youll see when the q comes out later today that there is a change in the provision of  million so youll see that number in the detail of the q scott mushkin so  million is that ongoing or is that a one time benefit for the quarter marco pagni our  million changed in the provision but clearly in terms of the benefit going forward there will be a benefit going forward in relation to this but clearly weve been doing a lot of work on looking at our base remuneration for our employees in our stores so were seeing rising costs in those areas for all the right reasons scott mushkin okay then the second thing i want to talk about obviously with the deal thats been announced just going through some of the hhi analysis from back when you guys did the original deal and just kind of curious in your salisbury maryland the hhi index goes almost close to  and i assume thats maybe one of the markets but i mean there is other markets that jump well into the region i’m just trying to get my arms around why this isn’t going to be a problem it seems to me a lot of these markets when you look at buffalo new york you look at some of these markets the hhi index is going really high marco pagni yes scott it’s marco again hhi index herfindahl index are pretty old technology for the ftc so im not sure that are particularly focused on that as a measure at all and as i said before we spend  months with the agency we have a pretty clear ideas to where theyre concerned about overlaps and where theyre not scott mushkin so like a bangor maine where youre going to be  share they are not concerned on that marco pagni as we said scott we’re pretty sure that we understand whether they are concerned and whether or not scott mushkin okay then my final question just has to do with something that came up earlier in the call just in transitioning from kind of streamlining the operation to kind of transforming it and then looking at the pressure on gross profit dollars how should we look at your earnings or your ebit algorithm in the us as we move out over the next year or two i mean it seems like its going to struggle to grow but i want to get your take on that and then i’ll yield thanks stefano pessina well as we have said many many times we are not living in an environment where we will see a lot of goals and particularly where we will see margin going – gross margin going up we accept these and we work on other part of the business on other elements of the profit or loss in order to compensate for it this is what we are trying to do what we have down and what we will continue to do so if you want to say that there are in these markets – certain headwinds of course there are but this is the nature of the business and we have to cope with it and we have to work on the elements that are available to half and believe us that are available to us to compensate for it which we have done until now and we continue to do scott mushkin thanks very much guys operator thank you and our next question comes from alvin concepcion of citi your line is now open alvin concepcion thanks for taking my question i know earlier you had talked about the deal closing a lot of gaps in your coverage but you have plans to divest or closed any of those stores youre playing to acquire to improve efficiency of stores where there is significant overlap stefano pessina listen when we will see exactly the situation of the each store we will take the decision of what to do what is important that to say is that – in what we have said in the  million of synergies that we have a given you we have not taking into account that the benefit that we could have from the rationalization of the network something will be there for sure but we cannot give you an indication because we need to see the details of each single store alex alexander gourlay that’s right stefano so i think theres nothing in the plan to the rationalization but obviously we’ll study the situation very carefully when we get to the right point in process and then well update you that is as simple as that in works we understand that model very well from within walgreens where we have been rationalizing some stores in some markets so we have a very clear model we used to assess the opportunity stefano pessina and in any case that this will be a plus up there of the deal for the time being we are not taking into our numbers so we would see as soon as we will be able to take a decision to take a thoughtful decision gerald gradwell and we probably have time for one more question thank you operator thank you and our final question comes from the line of john heinbockel of guggenheim securities your line is now open john heinbockel so i guess for alex the simplification program if you can dive into that a little bit more deeply is that solely sku rationalization is it also process improvement labor hours and then as it relates to sku rationalization is the idea that on certain take food for example that you cut back more deeply in something thats more convenience driven right that youre not necessarily known for is that a bigger target than i imagine would be an otc hba those core categories alexander gourlay hi john well i think again we are very rational – as we have the data now for four or five years of what’s in customers baskets and we use an idea to understand exactly where we should cut the tail and the stores are going to first of all our lowest volume stores there were looking at from a very local point of view so thats the first thing i would say the second thing i would say about this is that really is about taking the workload out of the stores so that our colleagues can spend more time with customers and reduce of course the store hours as appropriate with the workload is reduced we have a very very complicated operating model a lot of many promotions which in these less intense stores don’t sell causing a lot of excess working capital and sometimes loss in the business as well so the focus really is simply on making so easy to shop clear to shop reducing workload and making sure theres more as available within our store for customer care and im going to first  stores having done some tests and trials because these are stores where there is least risk to sales and lots more we can learn as we accelerate that process going forward john heinbockel and then just as a followup to that you talked about – the format is obviously very promotional so what would you like to do over time would you like to dial back the promotions i dont know if the format will ever work in a quasi edlp approach but dial back the promotions and then if you think about personalizing circulars what does that do to the ebbs and flows of product demand would that help you with respect to youre taking out or smoothing out labor in the stores george fairweather yes i think as i have said go back to the point that is very promotional far too promotional we dont think is good for us it’s not good for customers i mean dont think is actually good for suppliers either so we believe much more net consumption driven model and thats where we’re heading to also as customers change more and more new future will use personalization and digital marketing and more than the secular to understand what walgreens can do for them and weve got a mature digital organization for retail that as you know and were making moves no to really shift to spend over time in marketing and towards digital and personalization so all these things are true john and is an evolution of the model and were really accelerating it based on fact based on data and we are really making strong moves in the next  months as stefano said to do that and then we have the systems coming in and phase iii to really sustain not move and accelerate to further so weve been running for two or three years were very confident that we know the approach have to do i’m going to taking the steps to get on with it john heinbockel okay thank you end of qa gerald gradwell thank you and that all we have time for us so thank you very much indeed for everyone participating obviously if there are any further questions i know we didnt have time to address all the questions the ir teams are around about and available and please bear with us if it takes a lot to get back to you we do have quite a little lot of questions already queued up to get through so thank you very much indeed and we look forward to speaking
