rose  the sp  index declined  while the russell  index rose  over the same period each index is an unmanaged indicator of stock market performance for the threeyear period ended december   the funds total return averaged  annually versus an average annual total return of  for the sp  index and an average annual total return of  for the russell  index for the fiveyear period ended december   the

cumulative total return of  which equates to an average annual total return of  q what factors affected the funds performance in  a value stocks held up considerably better than growth stocks as evidenced by the valueoriented dow jones industrial averages performance relative to the growthoriented sp  index and nasdaq composite index the fact that a significant percentage of the portfolio is in small cap stocks also worked in our favor as the russell  index which is generally considered to be representative of small cap issues in the us stock market was the only widely followed market index finishing  in the black the fund was up  in this challenging market q in what sectors do you see value a advertisingsupported media stocks performed quite poorly this year until rallying strongly in the fourth quarter with the general economic malaise corporate advertising budgets were shrinking and revenues and earnings for media companies declined sharply after september  everyone expected things to go from bad to worse amazingly thanks to the courageous american consumer the economy held up remarkably well and although corporate advertising spending has not yet increased investors began anticipating better days ahead and taking advantage of outstanding bargains with the salt lake city winter olympics and americas patriotic fervor promising good ratings broadcasters should get a shot in the arm also with partisan politics rearing its ugly head over a fiscal stimulus package and control of the senate up for grabs we can expect midterm election political advertising to be strong we believe advertising media supported earnings will surprise on the upside in the quarters ahead helping sustain the strong rally we witnessed in the fourth quarter also significant changes in federal communications commission fcc rules and policies have set the stage for another round of consolidation in the media sector in general we believe merger and acquisition activity will accelerate in the year ahead as is usually the case during recessions and bear markets deal activity slowed considerably in  fewer deals get done when it is difficult to accurately assess a target companys intermediateterm revenue and profit prospects andor confidently project the future value of an acquiring companys stock as deal currency however recessions and declining stock markets usually set the stage for accelerating merger and   total return figures are historical and assume the reinvestment of dividends and distributions and the deduction of all fund expenses the actual total returns for owners of the variable annuity contracts or variable life insurance policies that provide for investment in the fund will be lower to reflect separate account and contractpolicy charges past performance is not a guarantee of future results investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investors shares when redeemed may be worth more or less

economic and market dust settles these bargains tend to get snapped up in a hurry q what is your outlook for the year  a economic data released at the end of december was quite encouraging consumer confidence continued to improve growth in new unemployment insurance claims was slowing there was even a modest uptick in business investment these are all valid signs the economy is regaining its footing at issue is just how strong the economic recovery will be although inventories have come down substantially there is still considerable excess capacity in the manufacturing sector until this excess capacity is reduced business investment will likely remain anemic this means consumers will have to continue to carry the economy on their backs we believe gross domestic product gdp will be up  to  in  well above the longerterm growth of  to  we envision the cut in taxes along with lower oil and fuel prices will help consumer spending overcome the drag from the stock markets wealth effect and rising unemployment fortunately we will not need an especially strong recovery to see significantly better corporate earnings in  companies in virtually every industry have been aggressively cutting costs with the exception of pockets in the technology and telecommunications equipment industries the inventory correction has largely run its course corporate interest expense has declined as have raw materials and energy prices corporate america wrote off everything it could get away with in  we call this the kitchen sink effect and due to federal accounting standards board fasb rule  the amortization of goodwill will no longer penalize earnings consequently we believe a modest economic recovery in the year ahead should be magnified in sharply higher reported earnings very easy earnings comparisons in the first and second quarters of  should help stabilize the market until investors gain confidence that earnings will improve in the second half in addition the crisis in confidence arising from enron will result in auditing firms and cfos cleaning up their numbers we expect that aggressive accounting will be back  but not in  lets talk stocks the following are stock

or market as of the close of business on the day the securities are being valued if there were no sales that day the security is valued at the average of the closing bid and asked prices or if there were no asked prices quoted on that day then the security is valued at the closing bid price on that day if no bid or asked prices are quoted on such day the security is valued at the most recently

selection process is based on the investment principles of graham and dodd the first investors to articulate the fundamentals of value investing their work provided the framework for value investing and we contributed to this framework with the discipline of private market value with a catalyst® this proprietary research and valuation method identifies companies whose shares are selling at a discount to intrinsic value with an identifiable path to realizing or surfacing that private market value we define private market value as the price an informed acquirer would pay for an entire enterprise the catalyst comprises identifiable events or circumstances that might reasonably result in the narrowing of the difference between the public market price of the stock and our estimate of the private market value this realization of value can take place gradually or suddenly with company specific changes such as management changes or restructurings sale of assets or of the business as a whole or industry changes such as changes in regulation or changes in competition the market volatility exhibited in  continued into the quarter ending march   as a sharply negative january preceded a flattish february followed by a march recovery driving much of these rotations were uneven economic data global concerns namely the chinese economy and oil production and speculation about interest rate increases and their timing near the close of the quarter the federal reserve left short term interest rates unchanged in its march meeting and suggested a cautious approach to rate hikes for the rest of the year during the quarter ended june  investors’ worries shifted from a collapse in china to a recession in the us and increasing oil prices and finally to brexit the united kingdom’s vote to exit the european union eu the vote to leave the eu sparked a market correction amplifying economic uncertainty increasing volatility and driving down the pound however these events were quickly followed by a strong bounce back to earlier more stable levels the quarter ending september  saw a mixed set of data including an improvement in consumer spending the overall market was up low single digits however core income growth meaning wages and salaries has been in a slowing trend for over a year the long term slow growth in gdp has resulted in low sales growth for corporations which has put downward pressure on profits and capital spending this has been part of the circle of low growth and more accommodative monetary and fiscal policies not just in the united states but globally

september      expense table   we believe it is important for you to understand the impact of fees and expenses regarding your investment all mutual funds have operating expenses as a shareholder of a fund you incur ongoing costs which include costs for portfolio management administrative services and shareholder reports like this one among others operating expenses which are deducted from a fund’s gross income directly reduce the investment return of a fund when a fund’s expenses are expressed as a percentage of its average net assets this figure is known as the expense ratio the following examples are intended to help you understand the ongoing costs in dollars of investing in your fund and to compare these costs with those of other mutual funds the examples are based on an investment of  made at the beginning of the period shown and held for the entire period the expense table below illustrates your fund’s costs in two ways actual fund return this section provides information about actual account values and actual expenses you may use this section to help you to estimate the actual expenses that you paid over the period after any fee waivers and expense reimbursements the “ending account value” shown is derived from the fund’s actual return during the past six months and the “expenses paid during period” shows the dollar amount that would have been paid by an investor who started with  in the fund you may use this information together with the amount you invested to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period to do so simply divide your account value by  for example an  account value divided by    then multiply the result by the number given for your fund under the heading “expenses paid during period” to estimate the expenses you paid during this period hypothetical  return this section provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the fund’s actual expense ratio it assumes a hypothetical annualized return of  before expenses during the period shown in this case – because the hypothetical return used is not the fund’s actual return – the results do not apply to your investment and you cannot use the hypothetical account value and expense to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period this example is useful in making comparisons of the ongoing costs of investing in the fund and other funds to do so compare this  hypothetical example with the  hypothetical examples that appear in shareholder reports of other funds please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs such as sales charges loads redemption fees or exchange fees if any which are described in the prospectus if these costs were applied to your account your costs would be higher therefore the  hypothetical return is useful in comparing ongoing costs only and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds the “annualized expense ratio” represents the actual expenses for the last six months and may be different from the expense ratio in the financial

gabelli equity income fund is a series of the gabelli equity series funds inc the “corporation” the corporation was incorporated on july   in maryland the fund is a diversified openend management investment company registered under the investment company act of  as amended the “ act” and one of three separately managed portfolios of the corporation the fund seeks to provide a high level of total return on its assets with an emphasis on income the fund commenced investment operations on january    significant accounting policies as an investment company the fund follows the investment company accounting and reporting guidance which is part of us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” that may require the use of management estimates and assumptions in the preparation of its financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates the following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the fund in the preparation of its financial statements security valuation portfolio securities listed or traded on a nationally recognized securities exchange or traded in the us overthecounter market for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last quoted sale price or a market’s official closing price as of the close of business on the day the securities are being valued if there were no sales that day the security is valued at the average of the closing bid and asked prices or if there were no asked prices quoted on that day then the security is valued at the closing bid price on that day if no bid or asked prices are quoted on such day the security is valued at the most recently available price or if the board of directors the “board” so determines by such other method as the board shall determine in good faith to reflect its fair market value portfolio securities traded on more than one national securities exchange or market are valued according to the broadest and most representative market as determined by gabelli funds llc the “adviser” portfolio securities primarily traded on a foreign market are generally valued at the preceding closing values of such securities on the relevant market but may be fair valued pursuant to procedures established by the board if market conditions change significantly after the close of the foreign market but prior to the close of business on the day the securities are being valued debt instruments with remaining maturities of sixty days or less that are not credit impaired are valued at amortized cost unless the board determines such amount does not reflect the securities’ fair value in which case these securities will be fair valued as determined by the board debt instruments having a maturity greater than sixty days for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the average of the latest bid and asked prices if there were no asked prices quoted on such day the security is valued using the closing bid price us government obligations with maturities greater than sixty days are normally valued using a model that incorporates market observable data such as reported sales of similar securities broker quotes yields bids offers and reference data certain securities are valued principally using dealer quotations securities and assets for which market quotations are not readily available are fair valued as determined by the board fair valuation methodologies and procedures may include but are not limited to analysis and review of available financial and nonfinancial information about the company comparisons with the valuation and changes in valuation of similar securities including a comparison of foreign securities with the equivalent us dollar value american depositary receipt securities at the close of the us exchange and evaluation of any other information that could be indicative of the value of the security    the gabelli equity income fund notes to financial statements continued     the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value of the fund’s investments are summarized into three levels as described in the hierarchy below     · level  —   quoted prices in active markets for identical securities   · level  —   other significant observable inputs including quoted prices for similar securities interest rates prepayment speeds credit risk etc and   · level  —   significant unobservable inputs including the board’s determinations as to the fair value of investments a financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input both individually and in the aggregate that is significant to the fair value measurement the inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities the summary of the fund’s investments in securities by inputs used to value the fund’s investments as of september   is as follows        valuation inputs

level  during the year ended september   the fund’s policy is to recognize transfers among levels as of the beginning of the reporting period additional information to evaluate qualitative information     general the fund uses recognized industry pricing services – approved by the board and unaffiliated with the adviser – to value most of its securities and uses broker quotes provided by market makers of securities not valued by these and other recognized pricing sources several different pricing feeds are received to value domestic equity securities international equity securities preferred equity securities and fixed income securities the data within these feeds is ultimately sourced from major stock exchanges and trading systems where these securities trade the prices supplied by external sources are checked by obtaining quotations or actual transaction prices from market participants if a price obtained from the pricing source is deemed unreliable prices will be sought from another pricing service or from a brokerdealer that trades that security or similar securities     fair valuation fair valued securities may be common and preferred equities warrants options rights and fixed income obligations where appropriate level  securities are those for which market quotations are not available such as securities not traded for several days or for which current bids are not available or which are restricted as to transfer among the factors to be considered to fair value a security are recent prices    the gabelli equity income fund notes to financial statements continued     of comparable securities that are publicly traded reliable prices of securities not publicly traded the use of valuation models current analyst reports valuing the income or cash flow of the issuer or cost if the preceding factors do not apply a significant change in the unobservable inputs could result in a lower or higher value in level  securities the circumstances of level  securities are frequently monitored to determine if fair valuation measures continue to apply the adviser reports quarterly to the board the results of the application of fair valuation policies and procedures these may include back testing the prices realized in subsequent trades of these fair valued securities to fair values previously recognized derivative financial instruments the fund may engage in various portfolio investment strategies by investing in a number of derivative financial instruments for the purposes of increasing the income of the fund hedging against changes in the value of its portfolio securities and in the value of securities it intends to purchase or hedging against a specific transaction with respect to either the currency in which the transaction is denominated or another currency investing in certain derivative financial instruments including participation in the options futures or swap markets entails certain execution liquidity hedging tax and securities interest credit or currency market risks losses may arise if the adviser’s prediction of movements in the direction of the securities foreign currency and interest rate markets is inaccurate losses may also arise if the counterparty does not perform its duties under a contract or that in the event of default the fund may be delayed in or prevented from obtaining payments or other contractual remedies owed to it under derivative contracts the creditworthiness of the counterparties is closely monitored in order to minimize these risks participation in derivative transactions involves investment risks transaction costs and potential losses to which the fund would not be subject absent the use of these strategies the consequences of these risks transaction costs and losses may have a negative impact on the fund’s ability to pay distributions the fund’s derivative contracts held at september   if any are not accounted for as hedging instruments under gaap and are disclosed in the schedule of investments together with the related counterparty     swap agreements the fund may enter into equity contract for difference swap transactions for the purpose of increasing the income of the fund the use of swaps is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio security transactions in an equity contract for difference swap a set of future cash flows is exchanged between two counterparties one of these cash flow streams will typically be based on a reference interest rate combined with the performance of a notional value of shares of a stock the other will be based on the performance of the shares of a stock depending on the general state of short term interest rates and the returns on the fund’s portfolio securities at the time an equity contract for difference swap transaction reaches its scheduled termination date there is a risk that the fund will not be able to obtain a replacement transaction or that the terms of the replacement will not be as favorable as on the expiring transaction unrealized gains related to swaps are reported as an asset and unrealized losses are reported as a liability in the statement of assets and liabilities the change in value of swaps including the accrual of periodic amounts of interest to be received or paid on swaps is reported as unrealized gain or loss in the statement of operations a realized gain or loss is recorded upon payment or receipt of a periodic payment or termination of swap agreements at september   the fund held no investments in equity contract for difference swap agreements    the gabelli equity income fund notes to financial statements continued     securities sold short the fund may enter into short sale transactions short selling involves selling securities that may or may not be owned and at times borrowing the same securities for delivery to the purchaser with an obligation to replace such borrowed securities at a later date the proceeds received from short sales are recorded as liabilities and the fund records an unrealized gain or loss to the extent of the difference between the proceeds received and the value of an open short position on the day of determination the fund records a realized gain or loss when the short position is closed out by entering into a short sale the fund bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the security sold short dividends on short sales are recorded as an expense by the fund on the exdividend date and interest expense is recorded on the accrual basis the broker retains collateral for the value of the open positions which is adjusted periodically as the value of the position fluctuates at september   there were no short sales outstanding foreign currency translations the books and records of the fund are maintained in us dollars foreign currencies investments and other assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at current exchange rates purchases and sales of investment securities income and expenses are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions unrealized gains and losses that result from changes in foreign exchange rates andor changes in market prices of securities have been included in unrealized appreciationdepreciation on investments and foreign currency translations net realized foreign currency gains and losses resulting from changes in exchange rates include foreign currency gains and losses between trade date and settlement date on investment securities transactions foreign currency transactions and the difference between the amounts of interest and dividends recorded on the books of the fund and the amounts actually received the portion of foreign currency gains and losses related to fluctuation in exchange rates between the initial purchase trade date and subsequent sale trade date is included in realized gainloss on investments foreign securities the fund may directly purchase securities of foreign issuers investing in securities of foreign issuers involves special risks not typically associated with investing in securities of us issuers the risks include possible revaluation of currencies the inability to repatriate funds less complete financial information about companies and possible future adverse political and economic developments moreover securities of many foreign issuers and their markets may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than securities of comparable us issuers foreign taxes the fund may be subject to foreign taxes on income gains on investments or currency repatriation a portion of which may be recoverable the fund will accrue such taxes and recoveries as applicable based upon its current interpretation of tax rules and regulations that exist in the markets in which it invests restricted securities the fund may invest up to  of its net assets in securities for which the markets are restricted restricted securities include securities whose disposition is subject to substantial legal or contractual restrictions the sale of restricted securities often requires more time and results in higher brokerage charges or dealer discounts and other selling expenses than does the sale of securities eligible for trading on national securities exchanges or in the overthecounter markets restricted securities may sell at a price lower than similar securities that are not subject to restrictions on resale securities freely saleable among qualified institutional investors under special rules adopted by the sec may be treated as liquid if they satisfy liquidity standards established by the board the continued liquidity of such securities is not as well assured as that of publicly traded securities and accordingly the board will monitor their liquidity at september   the fund held no restricted securities    the gabelli equity income fund notes to financial statements continued     securities transactions and investment income securities transactions are accounted for on the trade date with realized gainloss on investments determined by using the identified cost method interest income including amortization of premium and accretion of discount is recorded on the accrual basis premiums and discounts on debt securities are amortized using the effective yield to maturity method dividend income is recorded on the exdividend date except for certain dividends from foreign securities that are recorded as soon after the exdividend date as the fund becomes aware of such dividends determination of net asset value and calculation of expenses certain administrative expenses are common to and allocated among various affiliated funds such allocations are made on the basis of each fund’s average net assets or other criteria directly affecting the expenses as determined by the adviser pursuant to procedures established by the board in calculating the nav per share of each class investment income realized and unrealized gains and losses redemption fees and expenses other than class specific expenses are allocated daily to each class of shares based upon the proportion of net assets of each class at the beginning of each day distribution expenses are borne solely by the class incurring the expense distributions to shareholders distributions to shareholders are recorded on the exdividend date distributions to shareholders are based on income and capital gains as determined in accordance with federal income tax regulations which may differ from income and capital gains as determined under gaap these differences are primarily due to differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities and foreign currency transactions held by the fund timing differences and differing characterizations of distributions made by the fund distributions from net investment income for federal income tax purposes include net realized gains on foreign currency transactions these booktax differences are either temporary or permanent in nature to the extent these differences are permanent adjustments are made to the appropriate capital accounts in the period when the differences arise permanent differences were primarily due to recharacterization of distributions these reclassifications have no impact on the nav of the fund for the year ended september   reclassifications were made to decrease net investment income by  and decrease distributions in excess of net realized gain by  with an offsetting adjustment to paidin capital the tax character of distributions paid during the years ended september   and  was as follows        year

                        total distributions paid                                            total distributions paid differs from the statement of changes in net assets due to the utilization of equalization the fund has a fixed distribution policy under the policy the fund declares and pays monthly distributions from net investment income capital gains and paidin capital the actual source of the distribution is determined after the end of the calendar year pursuant to this policy distributions during the calendar year are made in excess of required distributions to the extent such distributions are made from current earnings and profits they are considered ordinary income or long term capital gains the fund’s current distribution policy may restrict the fund’s ability to pass through to shareholders all of its net realized long term capital gains as a    the gabelli equity income fund notes to financial statements continued     capital gain dividend subject to the maximum federal income tax rate of  and may cause such gains to be treated as ordinary income subject to a maximum federal income tax rate of  in addition certain us shareholders who are individuals estates or trusts and whose income exceeds certain thresholds will be required to pay  medicare tax on their “net investment income” which includes dividends received from the fund and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of shares of the fund distributions sourced from paidin capital should not be considered as dividend yield or the total return from an investment in the fund the board continues to evaluate its distribution policy in light of ongoing economic and market conditions and may change the amount of the monthly distributions in the future provision for income taxes the fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of  as amended the “code” it is the policy of the fund to comply with the requirements of the code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute substantially all of its net investment company taxable income and net capital gains therefore no provision for federal income taxes is required at september   the components of accumulated earningslosses on a tax basis were as follows   net unrealized appreciation on investments         at september   the temporary difference between book basis and tax basis net unrealized appreciation on investments was due to deferral of losses from wash sales for tax purposes and tax basis adjustments on investments

preparing the fund’s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are “morelikelythannot” of being sustained by the applicable tax authority income tax and related interest and penalties would be recognized by the fund as tax expense in the statement of operations if the tax positions were deemed not to meet the morelikelythannot threshold for the year ended september   the fund did not incur any income tax interest or penalties as of september   the adviser has reviewed all open tax years and concluded that there was no impact to the fund’s net assets or results of operations the fund’s federal and state tax returns for the prior three fiscal years remain open subject to examination on an ongoing basis the adviser will monitor the fund’s tax positions to determine if adjustments to this conclusion are necessary  investment advisory agreement and other transactions the fund has entered into an investment advisory agreement the “advisory agreement” with the adviser
