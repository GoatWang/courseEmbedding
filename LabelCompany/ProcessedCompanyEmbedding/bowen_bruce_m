is not very effective outside the usa yet this ‘closing’ method has become the standard around the world                          sales training now has a choice we are taught to build trust with our customers yet the traditional approach to sales has left sales people as low as  on a list of most trusted professions that terrible statistic reflects in the over reliance on today’s crm systems with less than less than a  conversion rate so while these statistics are extremely concerning why do we continue to use the same sales methods coreselling developed by international sales trainer bruce

rhode island supreme court opinions subscribe bowen v bowen annotate this case  ad   barbara j bowen v bruce m bowen no appeal supreme court of rhode island may    albert d saunders jr greenwich for plaintiff harold e krause jr providence for defendant opinion per curiam this case came before a hearing panel of this court for oral argument on april   pursuant to an order that had directed the defendant to show cause why the issues raised in his appeal should not be summarily decided after hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the issues raised by defendants appeals will be decided at this time barbara j bowen barbara and bruce m bowen bruce were divorced by final judgment of divorce entered on october   prior to the entry of that final judgment they had executed a property settlement agreement that while referenced in the final judgment for divorce was never merged therein bruce commencing in  failed to make the required monthly support payments called for in the property settlement agreement to barbara she thereupon filed a motion in the family court seeking to have bruce adjudged in contempt he filed a motion to modify the property settlement support agreement alleging a change in circumstances after hearing the family court granted barbaras motion to adjudge bruce in contempt and found bruce to be in contempt for failure to pay the agreedupon support payments bruces motion to modify was denied he appealed on that appeal this court on march   entered an order denying and dismissing bruces appeal and affirmed the denial of his motion to modify the support agreementalimony payments this court also at that time vacated the family courts order adjudging bruce to be in contempt in that order this court stated that when a separation agreement had not been merged into the final divorce judgment it retains the characteristics of a contract and not a court judgment and that barbaras remedy for breach of that contract was by civil action for breach of contract or a civil action for specific performance in a breach of contract action that order mirrored our holding in riffenburg v riffenburg  ad  ri and also in weiner v weiner  ri   ad   barbara ostensibly took the path indicated by our march   order and in april  filed a motion in the family court for specific performance of the property settlement support agreement after hearing a justice of the family court granted barbaras motion for specific performance in addition on the basis of the hearing evidence he found that bruce owed barbara  pursuant to the property settlement agreement terms a judgment containing those findings was entered on october   and bruce filed a timely appeal therefrom apparently both encouraged and revitalized by her recent success barbara next filed an application for a garnishment order pursuant to gl §  so as to permit withholding of sums sufficient for barbaras support from bruces earnings due from his employer under §  the garnished employer would be required to pay the amounts withheld from bruce directly to the clerk of the family court another justice of the family court heard that motion to assign and granted same bruce filed a timely appeal from that assignmentgarnishment order on appeal bruce asserts  that the family court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain and hear barbaras motionaction for specific performance and  that the wage assignmentgarnishment statute §  is limited to providing relief only with regard to family court childsupport orders  and not for support payments to barbara such as the  amount arising out of a property settlement contract and not deriving from an order of the family court we disagree with those contentions as to the subject matter jurisdiction in the family court over the specific performance motion in question we conclude that the family court had the requisite jurisdiction both legal and equitable to entertain barbaras motionaction for specific performance of the property settlement agreement in question as well as her application for a garnishment order pursuant to §  general laws  §  sets out the jurisdiction of the family court and in part specifically empowers that court to hear and determine all matters pertaining to property settlement agreements and all other contracts between persons who at the time of execution of said contracts were husband and wife or planned to enter into that relationship it appears clear from the wording of §  as amended by pl ch  §  that the family court had subject matter jurisdiction of the property settlement contract entered into between the parties here at a time when they were husband and wife acting pursuant thereto the findings of arrearage and the order to pay same made by the family court justice were proper we note that in riffenburg v riffenburg  ad  ri and our previous order entered on march   in bowen v bowen no a the pl ch  §  amended wording to §  was not raised by the parties had it been called to our attention we might therein have concluded that the family court did in fact have jurisdiction over the property settlement contracts entered into between the parties therein despite the fact that those particular agreements had not been merged into the final decrees in those cases see eg abedon v abedon  ri    ad    as regards the authority and the jurisdiction of the family court to order bruce to assign income due to him over to the clerk of the family court pursuant to §  we find the statute to encompass judgments containing child support orders as well as orders for support emanating from spousal support agreements recognized by §  in addition an order directing the assignment provided in §  can be made in proceedings subsequent to any initial spousal or child support order entered by the family court section  once having undertaken to issue an income assignment order the family court pursuant to §  has been invested with the like powers of the supreme and the superior courts as provided in gl §  that statute permits the family court to frame and issue such executions and other writs and processes as may be necessary or proper to carry into full effect all the powers and jurisdiction that had been vested in that court by constitution or statute garnishment of income from a defaulting obligor of support payments would be such a process available to the family court under §  for the reasons stated the defendants appeals from the final judgment for specific performance and from the order garnishing his wages entered by the family court are both denied and dismissed the judgment and order appealed from are affirmed and the papers in the case are remanded to that court weisberger cj and murray j not participating notes  we do not consider the motion for specific performance to constitute the civil action for breach of contract we
