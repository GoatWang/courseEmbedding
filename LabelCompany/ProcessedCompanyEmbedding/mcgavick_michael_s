president and ceo – chairman president and ceo address safeco corporation safeco plaza  brooklyn avenue northeast seattle washington  httpwwwsafecocom ■ in  the insurance and financialservices company executive michael s mike mcgavick was president chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of the seattle washington–based safeco corporation—the secondlargest commercial insurance operation in the united states when mcgavick was selected as safecos new leader the company was sinking rapidly due to severe operational and management problems safeco was in need of major retrenching—as phrased by technical analysts—and mcgavick said of the company and its employees on the safeco web site im going to reach out to people throughout the company our employees creative ideas and innovative thinking will unlock the full potential of safeco providing shareholders with the returns they deserve january   mcgavick proved able to do just what he said he would do—but not without making many tough decisions many of which were not well received however those decisions ultimately helped to bring safeco back to its traditionally successful role as a major multiline insurance company in the united states insurance the safeco way safeco a fortune  company with annual revenues of about  billion as of  sold a comprehensive array of insurance and financial investment products and services through a us network of over  independent agents brokers and financial advisors its family of companies provided products that included auto business casualty home life and property insurance investments such as lifeinsurance annuities mutual funds and stock purchase plans group excessloss medical and retirement plans and services for businesses and asset management surety bonds and trust services public affairs starts career mcgavick became vice president of the rockey company the seattle washington–based publicaffairs firm in  through his early professional career mcgavick held a number of publicaffairs positions including from  to  vice president of the seattlebased washington round table a nonpartisan policyresearch group composed of the top executives including chief executive officers of washingtons largest corporations campaign manager for us senator slade gortons successful reelection campaign in  chief of staff for gorton from  to  and partner with the gallatin group the seattlebased public affairs firm from  to  insuring his profession mcgavick began his insurance career in  spending three years as director of the superfund improvement project for the american insurance association in washington dc in that position he worked as a prime negotiator for the insurance industry with the us congress federal agencies and groups concerned about reforming the countrys superfund environmental laws before joining safeco mcgavick held a number of executive positions at the chicago illinois–based cna financial corporation starting in  during this time he was responsible for managing and improving cnas relationship with its independentagent distribution system and engineering cnas ecommerce strategy mcgavick served from  to  as vice president of new ventures from  to late  as senior financial officer of commercial lines group and from  to  as president and chief operating officer of financial corporation as president and chief operating officer of cna financial the companys largest operating unit mcgavick was responsible for the majority of the companys commercial insurance business he began a successful turnaround of cnas commercial operation when he reformulated the workforce distribution and implemented a completely new underwriting technique before mcgavick came on board unable to deal with the results of safecos traditionalbusiness acquisitions stock analysts shareholders and independent agents criticized company management especially beginning in  and throughout  in particular after safeco announced in january  that earnings were below expectations for the fifth consecutive quarter standard  poors removed the ratings of safeco and its related entities from creditwatch sps service highlighting the potential direction of a rating it lowered safecos credit rating and senior unsecureddebt rating from a to bbb financial security was downgraded from strong to good and the company was judged as having become much more likely to be negatively affected by adverse business conditions taking over at a critical junction the global managementsearch firm russell reynolds associates based in new york city performed an extensive hiring process with safeco in which the members of the board of directors reviewed over one hundred candidates for the position of chief executive officer mcgavick eventually won out he took over the position of president and chief executive officer in january  from william g reed jr who assumed the chairmanship of the board of directors as found on the company web site reed said of mcgavick upon his appointment mike understands the prestige safeco has always enjoyed and he has demonstrated the capacity to build and lead a strong team of executives january   reed went on to say mikes ideas energy and leadership ability clearly stood out among this field of proven business leaders mcgavick joined safeco at a difficult time in the companys history in  safeco made a major acquisition when it bought the large propertycasualty insurer american states instead of helping safeco to become a more diversified wellrounded financialservices leader the acquisition nearly bankrupted the company as the purchase was made for too much money and at the top of the underwriting cycle such that safeco had to reduce rates in order to maintain market share in an already unprofitable business climate operating earnings dropped throughout the next year and by the end of  safecos combined expense ratio of  percent was for the first time in its history worse than the industry average of  percent management team formed mcgavick assembled an outstanding management team in order to counter safecos problems and turn the company around for the benefit of shareholders customers and distribution partners alike one of the most important members of his management team was michael larocco who was formerly geicos vice president larocco was hired by mcgavick to become the president and chief operating officer of safecos personallines business larocco ultimately performed critical actions to help mcgavick reverse safecos plummeting position returning to excellence from the start mcgavick assured safecos independent agents that the companys primary distribution focus—that of an independentagency brand—would remain as it had in the past on the other hand he implied that the company might eliminate its homeowners market due to tremendous losses mcgavick immediately launched a series of initiatives to return safeco to its long tradition of excellence his first action was to reduce the companys stock dividend by about half in order to redirect the money toward the companys growth his second move was to write off  billion  million after taxes in goodwill obtained from the american states acquisition the huge onetime charge succeeded in clearing the balance sheet of negativity thirdly mcgavick sold the profitable safeco credit company to ge capital in order to reduce debt with shortterm debt cut by  percent mcgavick began a series of layoffs and consolidations in order to reduce corporate expenses he downsized safecos workforce by about  percent or around  jobs mcgavicks next concern was the homeowners business which was losing enormous amounts of money mcgavick told his troops that he did not intend to exit the market entirely but would if he were forced to do so with mcgavick guiding analysis and research management members eventually decided to raise prices for all homeowner accounts another problem spot seen by mcgavick was the propertycasualty business unit he assigned larocco to reorganize safecos directmarketing strategy larocco modeled the new strategy after geicos operations resulting in lower businessmodel costs particularly with respect to distribution expenses mcgavick also invested in technology during safecos turnaround he directed safeco management to install a common technology platform to handle homeowners automobile and small commercial businesses mcgavick rationalized this additional expense by assuming that once the company had recovered from its downturn it would be able to significantly reduce expenses associated with the new investment positive results within  months under mcgavicks leadership management at safeco took strong actions to improve the performance of core business lines strengthen the balance sheet with a noticeable turnaround in market capitalization and reduce core distribution expenses meanwhile investing in training and new technologies that were aimed at improving customer service and product distribution respectively mcgavick accomplished this feat with five core directives in mind to focus on the qualities that made an organization unique in its industry to do whatever might be necessary even if it involved performing radical surgery as phrased by mcgavick to take the pain earlier rather than later to invest in new systems and infrastructures and to communicate so that actions backed up words safeco turned its financial performance around in  generating net income of more than  million the companys best results in four years see also entry
