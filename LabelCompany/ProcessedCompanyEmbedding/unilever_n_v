shown on television and popularised by the internet dove fell under scrutiny from the general public as they felt the dove advertisements described the opinion that cellulite was still unsightly and that womens ageing process was something to be ashamed of lynxaxe axe known as lynx in the united kingdom the republic of ireland australia and new zealand is a toiletries brand marketed towards young men between the age of  and  its marketing is a tongueincheek take on the mating game suggesting that women are instantly drawn to men using the products unlike doves long running beauty campaign lynx advertising often creates mini series of advertisements based around a singular product rather than communicating an overarching idea this advertising campaign thrives on controversy using images which the company knows will receive complaints about garners the brand more free publicity and notoriety a wide variety of these adverts have been banned in countries around the world in  lynxs clean balls advert was banned this advert designed for television shows an attractive young woman cleaning various sport balls in  in the uk lynxs shower gel campaign was banned the poster for lynx shower gel showed a woman in an undone bikini under a shower at a beach with the headline the cleaner you are the dirtier you get both advertising campaigns make stark comparisons between how women and their

gases largely due to the destruction of rainforests for the palm oil industry which contributed to  of global green house gas emissions according to greenpeace palm oil expansion was taking place with little oversight from central or local government as procedures for environmental impact assessment landuse planning and ensuring a proper process for development of concessions were neglected

that womens ageing process was something to be ashamed of lynxaxe axe known as lynx in the united kingdom the republic of ireland australia and new zealand is a toiletries brand marketed towards young men between the age of  and  its marketing is a tongueincheek take on the mating game suggesting that women are instantly drawn to men using the products unlike doves long running beauty campaign lynx

which the company knows will receive complaints about garners the brand more free publicity and notoriety a wide variety of these adverts have been banned in countries around the world in  lynxs clean balls advert was banned this advert designed for television shows an attractive young woman cleaning various sport balls in  in the uk lynxs shower gel campaign was banned the poster for lynx shower gel showed a woman in an undone bikini under a shower at a beach with the headline the cleaner you are the dirtier you get both advertising campaigns make stark comparisons between how women and their

scheme the company has stated that at least  of the tea in its products originates from certified farms compared to the alliances  minimum entry point unilever decided on the scheme over fairtrade because according to the companys analysis fairtrade might lack the scale and the organizational flexibility to certify industrial tea estates criticismedit main article rainforest alliance § criticism and response the rainforest alliance certification scheme has been criticised for not offering producers minimum or guaranteed price therefore leaving them vulnerable to market price variations the alternative certificate fairtrade has however received similar criticism as well the rainforest alliance certification has furthermore been criticised for allowing the use of the seal on products that contain only a minimum of  of certified content which according to some endangers the integrity of the certification july  september  salmonella affairedit salmonella affair in cereals in israeledit in july  rumours about salmonella contamination in cereals spread among israeli consumers initially unilever did not provide public information about the subject and queries on the matter were initially rebuffed by the company as a nonstory and nonsense on the night of  july  unilever had stopped transferring cornflakes to retailer chains on  july yediot ahronot reported tens of thousands of boxes of breakfast cereal had been destroyed by  july despite the companys assurances that nothing contaminated was released for consumption many customers stopped buying unilever products and started to throw away all cornflakes made by unilever the company withheld the information about what were the affected production dates on  august  globes reported that the company has published more information about telma cereals handled on the packaging line in which the contamination was discovered and that a telma announcement had been made we again stress that all telma products in the stores and in your homes are safe to eat according to our companys strict procedures every production batch is checked and put on hold these products are not marketed until test

may be sourced in pigeon faeces the health ministry said that there might be other sources for the contamination and pigeon faeces are not the only possible source globes also said that the production line is automatic without human hands and the possibility that the source is human is a very slim chance on  august  the israeli health minister suspended a manufacturing licence until unilever carry out a number of corrections the action came after an inspection of the arad plant stating this was a series of negligent mistakes and not an incident with malicious intent by the firms management and quality control procedures an investigation led by prof itamr grutto and eli gordon concluded that the event was caused by negligence on  september it was reported that the cereals produced between the th and th at the arad plant had traces of salmonella class actionsedit a filed class action must first be approved by an israeli court after an approval the case will be held for a sum of  million

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible
