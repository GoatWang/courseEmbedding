    decided august   david friedman jp leland g degrasse helen e freedman sheila abdus–salaam jjobrien llp new york sean obrien and sara a welch of counsel and gibbons pc new york elizabeth ann fitzwater of counsel for appellants liddle  robinson llp new york david i greenberger jeffrey l liddle james r hubbard and jennifer rodriguez of counsel for respondents at issue in this appeal is whether reports prepared by a computer forensic analyst retained by plaintiffs counsel in connection with a discovery demand by defendants for production of plaintiffs computers are privileged the motion court held that the reports are privileged and that the privilege was not waived when the analyst read his reports to refresh his recollection prior to testifying we reverse and remand the matter to the motion court for an in camera inspection to determine what portions if any of the reports are privileged attorney work product as the remaining portions are discoverable pursuant to cplr dplaintiffs gentry beach and robert vollero were employed as portfolio managers by defendantcounterclaim plaintiff touradji capital management lp touradji from  through  after their departure plaintiffs commenced this action seeking more than  million in compensation they claimed was owed to them defendants filed counterclaims against plaintiffs and their new business vollero beach capital funds including a claim that plaintiffs had stolen its proprietary information in order to form their new venture which directly competes with defendantsduring discovery in response to a demand by defendants vollero produced a cd containing electronic files related to his work at touradji defendants sought to obtain volleros personal laptop computers for a forensic examination believing they contained stolen proprietary information the special master denied that request instead ordering vollero to be deposed concerning the electronic files he had produced at deposition vollero testified that he believed the files he had produced on the cd had been transferred from his personal sony vaio computer he also testified that he owned an ibm thinkpad but did not recall putting any touradji data on that computer in response to this testimony touradji requested that it be permitted to examine both of the personal computers or that the computers be analyzed by a thirdparty forensic examiner vollero did not comply with that request but his counsel arranged for a forensic examination of the computers and touradji identified specific areas of inquiry for the examinerthe forensic computer analyst retained by volleros counsel performed an examination which revealed that none of the electronic files produced by vollero had been located on the sony vaio but instead had been on the ibm thinkpad additionally the forensic analyst identified hundreds of deleted files related to touradji on the ibm thinkpad and restored them he also found other files on both the sony vaio and the ibm thinkpad that were responsive to touradjis discovery demands those files were produced to touradji a subsequent application by defendants for an order compelling vollero to turn over the two computers to their own vendor for inspection and analysis was denied instead the special referee ordered a fourhour deposition of the forensic analystthe forensic analyst testified about the searches software and methods he used to examine the computers although he could not recall all the specifics of his findings touradjis counsel asked the forensic analyst whether he had prepared a “written report” of his findings concerning the vollero computers plaintiffs counsel objected to the question on the grounds of privilege the special referee permitted the question to be asked as it simply called for a yes or no answer and the forensic analyst responded “yes” touradjis counsel then asked the forensic analyst if he had reviewed the reports prior to his deposition and the analyst replied that he had reviewed his reports touradji made an application to the referee seeking production of those reports asserting that the reports were not privileged and that even if they were the privilege was waived when the forensic analyst used the reports to refresh his recollection prior to his deposition the referee denied the application noting that the reports were privileged or material prepared for litigation and not subject to discoveryin moving to review the referees ruling and obtain discovery of the forensic analysts reports touradji argued that this courts decision in herrmann v general tile  rubber co  add    held that once a witness has reviewed a document to refresh his recollection for a deposition the adverse party is entitled to it even if it is otherwise privileged plaintiffs opposed the motion arguing that although the herrmann case seemed to direct release of the report herrmann is not followed by the other departments the motion court held that the reports are privileged and denied the motionthe work product of an attorney is privileged and that privilege “extends to experts retained as consultants to assist in analyzing or preparing the case ․ hudson ins co v oppenheim  add    however“that doctrine affords protection only to facts and observations disclosed by the attorney thus it is the information and observations of the attorney that are conveyed to the expert which may thus be subject to trial exclusion the work product doctrine does not operate to insulate other disclosed information from public exposure” people v edney  nyd    see also central buffalo project corp v rainbow salads inc  add   the concept of attorney work product is narrowly construed and “embraces ‘interviews statements memoranda correspondence briefs mental impressions and personal beliefs that were held prepared or conducted by the attorney” zimmerman v nassau hospital  add    only the information and observations disclosed by the attorney and conveyed to the expert  are subject to exclusion” in this case the reports were prepared at the request of plaintiffs counsel in response to defendants demand that they be permitted to examine plaintiffs computers instead of permitting defendants to conduct their own examination plaintiffs counsel retained a forensic analyst to ostensibly perform the same search that would have been conducted by defendants if they had been given access to the computers the only portion of the analysts reports that could be attorney work product would be impressions directions etc of counselthe court should have conducted an in camera review to ascertain whether any portion of the reports is attorney work product see hudson ins co v oppenheim  add   supra court conducted in camera review of the withheld documents before concluding that they were privileged  the information in the reports as to how the search was conducted what was found what was deleted when it was deleted etc is material prepared for litigation and defendants have demonstrated a substantial need for the reports and are unable to obtain the information by any other means cplr d   see drizin v sprint corp  add     additionally the conditional privilege that attaches to material prepared for litigation is waived when used by a witness to refresh a recollection prior to testimony see merrill lynch realty commercial servs vr rudin mgt co  add   compare maisch v millard fillmore hosps  add   to the extent that any portion of the reports prepared by the forensic analyst is attorney work product the privilege protects the reports notwithstanding that the analyst reviewed the reports prior to his deposition see generally fernekes v catskill regional med ctr  add    geffers v canisteo cent school dist no   add    while herrmann  add  has been cited for the contrary result requiring production of a report on the ground that the attorney work product privilege has been waived by the witnesss review of a work product document prior to testimony see eg crawford v lahiri  add    the issue in herrmann involved a tape recording of a witness interview that had been made by an insurance company not by or for an attorney thus it was material prepared for litigation and whatever conditional privilege attached to the tape was waived when it was used to refresh the witnesss recollection prior to testimony see rouse v county of greene  add   supra citing herrmann and holding that any conditional privilege that may have attached to a diary kept of medical treatment was waived when witness used diary to refresh recollection prior to testimony see also merrill lynch realty commercial servs v rudin mgt co  add   supra citing herrmann and holding that any privilege for a chronology that had been kept was waived when used to prepare for deposition  because an inartful reference to attorney work product in herrmann may indicate that the ruling in herrmann applies to a waiver of attorney work product privilege we clarify that the attorney work product privilege is not waived when a privileged document is used to refresh the recollection of a witness prior to testimonyaccordingly the order of the supreme court new york county richard b lowe iii j entered september   which denied the motion by defendants and counterclaim plaintiffs for review of the special referees ruling and to obtain discovery of

dismissal of labor law claim over bonuses allegedly incurred during employment with hedge fund as compensation in dispute was not for wages or personal productivity complaint fileddecember   rji datefebruary   decision datejune   in this breach of contract action plaintiffs gentry t beach and robert vollero argued they are owed in excess of  million for bonuses and profits incurred during

portfolio profits and a fund management fee touradji opposed alleging that beach and vollero would receive bonuses at its discretion and received payouts of bonuses amounting to  million the court previously granted touradji’s motion for summary judgment as to count two for violation of § of the new york labor law plaintiffs beach and vollero moved to reargue the decision the court denied beach’s motion to reargue dismissal ruling that as previously ordered the money sought did not constitute wages as it depended on factors other than beach’s and vollero’s own performance including touradji’s management and the contribution of the team of analysts working on portfolios as the compensation issue involved bonuses rather than earnings the funds did not constitute wages as defined
