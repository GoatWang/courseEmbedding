my resources to help repair that inequity” – george b kaiser a letter from george kaiser i suppose i arrived at my charitable commitment largely through guilt i recognized early on that my good fortune was not due to superior personal character or initiative so much as it was to dumb luck i was blessed to be born in an advanced society with caring parents so i had the advantage of both genetics winning the “ovarian lottery” and upbringing as i looked around at those who did not have these advantages it became clear to me that i had a moral obligation to direct my resources to help right that balance no child is responsible for the circumstances of his or her birth i have therefore developed my charitable focus around the concept of providing the greatest opportunity for selffulfillment for each child focusing on those who arrive in the least advantaged circumstances that governing concept has led us to those initiatives which attempt to reverse the generational cycle of poverty especially for very young children and their families prenatal health care early learning and development for atrisk kids birth to three family health care parenting training job and income

me in my intention to devote virtually all of my financial resources to these same general charitable purposes we have also chosen to focus these efforts in the community that welcomed my family from nazi germany by doing so we hope to pursue the best approaches drawing from the experience of others and make a measurable impact if we can be successful then maybe we will more closely approach the

policy institute a nonprofit energy policy organization located at the university of tulsa whose president since its inception is former alaska governor tony knowles and whose director was former us representative brad carson in january  kaiser drew attention after he told a committee of the oklahoma house of representatives that the state should eliminate or reduce tax incentives for the oil and gas industry and instead use the money for health care or education programs or for tax cuts for other taxpayers the foundation was instrumental in the funding of tulsas woody guthrie center which

programs it also reimburses the students tuition if they work in oklahoma for four years after graduating the foundation has also brought at least  young teachers to tulsa through the teach for

oklahoma to create a school of community medicine at its tulsa campus the money supplemented a  million donation by the schusterman family the grants reimburse all tuition for students who graduate as doctors and who work for five years in the community kaisers philosophy about anonymous charitable giving reportedly is naming rights are a seductive philanthropic inducement yet more anonymous

democratic party political candidates for every  that he gave republican party candidates kaiser was a fundraiser for the  presidential campaign of barack obama and functioned as a campaign bundler for obama an individual who collects contributions to a candidate from others that are then simultaneously given to the candidate at one  event for obama he raised more than  an  article by bill

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime
