been struggling with soft store and mall traffic trends and a tough retail landscape due to the change in consumer shopping preferences and the rise of competition with pureplay ecommerce names like amazoncom inc amzn not only this the players in the sector have also been hit hard by major economic challenges like the strong us dollar volatile commodity costs and global uncertainty the volatility in us dollar for quite some time now has been hurting retailers with worldwide operations this scenario has largely weighed on the performance of retailers particularly apparel and department stores in a bid to stay in the rat race and be ahead of the curve these retailers are heavily investing in building upon its ecommerce and omnichannel functionalities at the same time they remain focused on optimizing store fleet and are eventually cutting down upon brickandmortar store counts also these companies have taken up an aggressive remodeling of stores to attract traffic some retailers that are concentrating on optimizing store fleet include macys inc m and american eagle outfitters inc aeo and j c penney company inc jcp further dicks sporting goods inc dks also announced plans to bring a
