force’s final report which presents a roadmap for achieving competitive safe ubiquitous and faster payments  the task force was created by the federal reserve and is comprised of more than  stakeholders with an interest in us payments  the task force was called on to collectively identify criteria for endtoend solutions that would produce effective st century payments systems and task force members were invited to put forward proposals that meet the task force’s recommendations    tch and fis were active participants in the task force’s initiative and submitted a joint proposal for evaluation of tch’s realtime payments rtp system which is targeted to launch  later this year  tch enlisted the help of fis to help achieve ubiquity by offering enhanced rtp services to more than  financial institutions  “the federal reserve faster payments task force’s final report marks a significant milestone in the path toward faster payments in the us” said russ waterhouse executive vice

and payments fis “speed ubiquity and ease of use lead to high adoption rates and relevant payment solutions that banks can offer to their retail small business and corporate clients fis understands the specialized risks inherent in a real time payments scheme and that’s why we focus on minimizing risk to support systems and ensure appropriate fraud prevention measures are taken into account all this is vital to gain largescale user uptake and thus turn a realtime payments vision into realtime business value for all” the task force defined  effectiveness criteria grouped into the six categories ubiquity efficiency safety and security speed fast legal and governance  these criteria were critical in helping tch as it worked to design and build its rtp system  tch and fis were
