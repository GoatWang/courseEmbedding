item a risk factors and cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements which describe important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and nonhistorical information contained herein in addition the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto of charter communications inc and subsidiaries included in part ii item  financial statements and supplementary data overview we are the second largest cable operator in the united states and a leading broadband communications services company providing video internet and voice services to approximately  million residential and business customers at december   in addition we sell video and online advertising inventory to local regional and national advertising customers and fiberdelivered communications and managed it solutions to larger enterprise customers we also own and operate regional sports networks and local sports news and community channels and sell security and home management services to the residential marketplace see part i item  business  products and services for further description of these services including customer statistics for different services since  legacy charter has actively invested in its network and operations and improved the quality and value of the products and packages that legacy charter offered through the rollout of spectrum pricing and packaging we have simplified our offers and improved our packaging of products delivering more value to new and existing customers further through the transition of our legacy charter markets to our alldigital platform we increased our offerings to more than  hd channels in most of the legacy charter markets and offered internet speeds of at least  or  mbps among other benefits we believe that this product set combined with improved customer service as we insource our workforce in our call centers and in our field operations has led to lower customer churn and longer customer lifetimes as a result of the transactions  revenues increased by over  billion year over year we also saw an increase in expenses related to our increased scale in september  we began launching spp to legacy twc markets and we expect that by mid  we will offer spp in all legacy twc and legacy bright house markets in  we intend to begin converting the remaining legacy twc and legacy bright house analog markets to an alldigital platform our corporate organization as well as our marketing sales and product development departments are now centralized field operations are managed through eleven regional areas each designed to represent a combination of designated marketing areas and managed with largely the same set of field employees that were with the three legacy companies prior to completion of the transactions over a multiyear period legacy twc and legacy bright house customer care centers will migrate to legacy charters model of using segmented virtualized usbased inhouse call centers we will focus on deploying superior products and service with minimal service disruptions as we integrate our information technology and network operations we expect customer and financial results to trend similar to legacy charter following the implementation of the legacy charter operating strategies across the legacy twc and legacy bright house markets as a result of implementing our operating strategy at legacy twc and legacy bright house we cannot be certain that we will be able to grow revenues or maintain our margins at recent historical rates the company realized revenue adjusted ebitda and income from operations during the periods presented as follows in millions all percentages are calculated using whole numbers minor differences may exist due to rounding years ended december  growth     over   over  actual revenues           adjusted ebitda           income from operations           pro forma revenues       adjusted ebitda       income from operations       adjusted ebitda is defined as consolidated net income loss plus net interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization stock compensation expense loss on extinguishment of debt gain loss on financial instruments net other income expense net and other operating income expenses such as merger and restructuring costs other pension benefits special charges and gain on a pro forma basis assuming the transactions occurred as of january   total revenue growth was primarily due to growth in our internet and commercial businesses on a pro forma basis adjusted ebitda growth was primarily due to an increase in residential and commercial revenues offset by increases in programming costs and other operating costs in addition to the factors discussed above income from operations on a pro forma basis was affected by increases in depreciation and amortization merger and restructuring costs and stock compensation expense approximately   and  of our revenues for years ended december    and  respectively are attributable to monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our video internet voice and commercial services provided by our cable systems generally these customer subscriptions may be discontinued by the customer at any time subject to a fee for certain commercial customers the remaining   and  of revenue for fiscal years   and  respectively is derived primarily from advertising revenues franchise and other regulatory fee revenues which are collected by us but then paid to local authorities payperview and vod programming installation processing fees or reconnection fees charged to customers to commence or reinstate service and commissions related to the sale of merchandise by home shopping services we incurred the following transition costs in connection with the transactions in millions years ended december     operating expenses       other operating expenses       interest expense       capital expenditures       amounts included in transition operating expenses and transition capital expenditures represent incremental costs incurred to integrate the legacy twc and legacy bright house operations and to bring the three companies systems and processes into a uniform operating structure costs are incremental and would not be incurred absent the integration other operating expenses associated with the transactions represent merger and restructuring costs and include advisory legal and accounting fees employee retention costs employee termination costs and other exit costs interest expense associated with the transactions represents interest incurred on the cco safari ii cco safari iii and ccoh safari notes issued in advance of the closing of the transactions the proceeds of which were held in escrow to finance the transactions we have a history of net losses our net losses were principally attributable to insufficient revenue to cover the combination of operating expenses interest expenses that we incur on our debt depreciation expenses resulting from the capital investments we have made and continue to make in our cable properties amortization expenses related to our customer relationship intangibles and higher noncash income tax expense we will incur significant increases in interest expense and depreciation and amortization as a result of the transactions and will incur restructuring and transition costs for at least one to two years and as a result absent nonrecurring impacts such as the reversal of the income tax valuation allowance in the second quarter of  we may incur net losses in the future critical accounting policies and estimates certain of our accounting policies require our management to make difficult subjective andor complex judgments management has discussed these policies with the audit committee of charters board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the following disclosure we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the estimates assumptions and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows property plant and equipment capitalization of labor and overhead costs valuation and impairment of property plant and equipment useful lives of property plant and equipment intangible assets valuation and impairment of franchises valuation and impairment of goodwill valuation and impairment and amortization of customer relationships income taxes litigation programming agreements pension plans in addition there are other items within our financial statements that require estimates or judgment that are not deemed critical such as the allowance for doubtful accounts and valuations of our financial instruments but changes in estimates or judgment in these other items could also have a material impact on our financial statements property plant and equipment the cable industry is capital intensive and a large portion of our resources are spent on capital activities associated with extending rebuilding and upgrading our cable network as of december   and  the net carrying amount of our property plant and equipment consisting primarily of cable distribution systems was approximately  billion representing  of total assets and  billion representing  of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents respectively total capital expenditures for the years ended december    and  were approximately  billion  billion and  billion respectively capitalization of labor and overhead costs costs associated with network construction initial placement of the customer drop to the dwelling and the initial placement of outlets within a dwelling along with the costs associated with the initial deployment of customer premise equipment necessary to provide video internet or voices services are capitalized costs capitalized include materials direct labor and certain indirect costs these indirect costs are associated with the activities of personnel who assist in installation activities and consist of compensation and overhead costs associated with these support functions while our capitalization is based on specific activities once capitalized we track these costs on a composite basis by fixed asset category at the cable system level and not on a specific asset basis for assets that are sold or retired we remove the estimated applicable cost and accumulated depreciation the costs of disconnecting service and removing customer premise equipment from a dwelling and the costs to reconnect a customer drop or to redeploy previously installed customer premise equipment are charged to operating expensed as incurred costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred while plant and equipment replacement including replacement of certain components betterments and replacement of cable drops and outlets are capitalized we make judgments regarding the installation and construction activities to be capitalized we capitalize direct labor and overhead using standards developed from actual costs and applicable operational data we calculate standards annually or more frequently if circumstances dictate for items such as the labor rates overhead rates and the actual amount of time required to perform a capitalizable activity for example the standard amounts of time required to perform capitalizable activities are based on studies of the time required to perform such activities overhead rates are established based on an analysis of the nature of costs incurred in support of capitalizable activities and a determination of the portion of costs that is directly attributable to capitalizable activities the impact of changes that resulted from these studies were not material in the periods presented labor costs directly associated with capital projects are capitalized capitalizable activities performed in connection with installations include such activities as dispatching a truck roll to the customers dwelling or business for service connection or placement of new equipment verification of serviceability to the customers dwelling or business ie determining whether the customers dwelling is capable of receiving service by our cable network andor receiving advanced or internet services customer premise activities performed by inhouse field technicians and thirdparty contractors in connection with customer installations installation of equipment in connection with the installation of video internet or voice services and equipment replacement and betterment and verifying the integrity of the customers network connection by initiating test signals downstream from the headend to the customers digital settop box as well as testing signal levels at the pole or pedestal judgment is required to determine the extent to which overhead costs incurred result from specific capital activities and therefore should be capitalized the primary costs that are included in the determination of the overhead rate are i employee benefits and payroll taxes associated with capitalized direct labor ii direct variable costs associated with capitalizable activities while we believe our existing capitalization policies are appropriate a significant change in the nature or extent of our system activities could affect managements judgment about the extent to which we should capitalize direct labor or overhead in the future we monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policies and perform updates to our internal studies on an ongoing basis to determine whether facts or circumstances warrant a change to our capitalization policies we capitalized direct labor and overhead of  million  million and  million respectively for the years ended december    and  valuation and impairment of property plant and equipment we evaluate the recoverability of our property plant and equipment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable such events or changes in circumstances could include such factors as the impairment of our indefinite life franchises changes in technological advances fluctuations in the fair value of such assets adverse changes in relationships with local franchise authorities adverse changes in market conditions or a deterioration of current or expected future operating results a longlived asset is deemed impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset no impairments of longlived assets to be held and used were recorded in the years ended december    and  we utilize the cost approach as the primary method used to establish fair value for our property plant and equipment in connection with business combinations the cost approach considers the amount required to replace an asset by constructing or purchasing a new asset with similar utility then adjusts the value in consideration of physical depreciation and functional and economic obsolescence as of the appraisal date the cost approach relies on managements assumptions regarding current material and labor costs required to rebuild and repurchase significant components of our property plant and equipment along with assumptions regarding the age and estimated useful lives of our property plant and equipment useful lives of property plant and equipment we evaluate the appropriateness of estimated useful lives assigned to our property plant and equipment based on annual analysis of such useful lives and revise such lives to the extent warranted by changing facts and circumstances any changes in estimated useful lives as a result of this analysis are reflected prospectively beginning in the period in which the study is completed our analysis of useful lives in  did not indicate a change in useful lives the effect of a oneyear decrease in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property plant and equipment as of december   would be an increase in annual depreciation expense of approximately  billion the effect of a oneyear increase in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property plant and equipment as of december   would be a decrease in annual depreciation expense of approximately  million depreciation expense related to property plant and equipment totaled  billion  billion and  billion for the years ended december    and  respectively representing approximately   and  of costs and expenses respectively depreciation is recorded using the straightline composite method over managements estimate of the useful lives of the related assets as listed below cable distribution systems  years customer premise equipment and installations  years vehicles and equipment  years buildings and improvements  years furniture fixtures and equipment  years intangible assets valuation and impairment of franchises the net carrying value of franchises as of december   and  was approximately  billion representing  of total assets and  billion representing  of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents respectively for more information and a complete discussion of how we value and test franchise assets for impairment see note  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item  financial statements and supplementary data we perform an impairment assessment of franchise assets annually or more frequently as warranted by events or changes in circumstances we performed a qualitative assessment in  our assessment included consideration of the fair value appraisals of legacy charter and the newlyacquired operations performed as of the date of acquisition for tax and acquisition accounting purposes respectively along with a multitude of factors that affect the fair value of our franchise assets examples of such factors include environmental and competitive changes within our operating footprint actual and projected operating performance the consistency of our operating margins equity and debt market trends including changes in our market capitalization and changes in our regulatory and political landscape among other factors based on our assessment we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our franchise assets equals or exceeds their carrying values and that a quantitative impairment test is not required the appraisals indicated that the fair value of our franchise assets exceeded carrying value by approximately  in the aggregate with the excess entirely attributable to the franchise assets of legacy charter to which acquisition accounting was not applied at our unit of accounting level for franchise asset impairment testing the amount by which fair value exceeds carrying value varies based on the extent to which the unit of accounting was comprised of newlyacquired operations for units of accounting comprised entirely or substantially of newlyacquired operations we believe the carrying value approximates the fair value given that there has been no significant adverse changes in factors impacting our fair value estimates since the transaction date for units of accounting comprised of at least  legacy charter operations the fair value exceeded carrying value by a range of  to  valuation and impairment of goodwill the net carrying value of goodwill as of december   and  was approximately  billion representing  of total assets and  billion representing  of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents respectively for more information and a complete discussion on how we test goodwill for impairment see note  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item  financial statements and supplementary data we perform our impairment assessment of goodwill annually as of november th as with our franchise impairment testing we elected to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill in  which included the fair value appraisals and other factors described above based on the appraisals we determined that the fair value of our goodwill exceeded carrying value by approximately  as of the closing of the transactions given the limited amount of time between the closing of the transactions and the completion of the assessment and absence of significant adverse changes in factors impacting our fair value estimates we concluded that it is more likely than not that our goodwill is not impaired valuation impairment and amortization of customer relationships the net carrying value of customer relationships as of december   and  was approximately  billion representing  of total assets and  million representing  of total assets excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents respectively amortization expense related to customer relationships for the years ended december    and  was approximately  billion  million and  million respectively no impairment of customer relationships was recorded in the years ended december    and  for more information and a complete discussion on our valuation methodology and amortization method see note  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item  financial statements and supplementary data income taxes as of december   charter had approximately  billion of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a gross deferred tax asset of approximately  billion these losses resulted from the operations of charter holdco and its subsidiaries and from loss carryforwards received as a result of the twc transaction federal tax net operating loss carryforwards expire in the years  through  in addition as of december   charter had state tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in a gross deferred tax asset net of federal tax benefit of approximately  million state tax net operating loss carryforwards generally expire in the years  through  such tax loss carryforwards can accumulate and be used to offset charters future taxable income as of december   all of charters federal tax loss carryforwards are subject to section  and other restrictions pursuant to these restrictions charter estimates that approximately  billion in   billion in   million in  and an additional  million annually over each of the next five years of federal tax loss carryforwards should become unrestricted and available for charters use an additional  million is currently subject to a valuation allowance charters state tax loss carryforwards are subject to similar but varying restrictions in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance management takes into account various factors including the expected level of future taxable income available tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences due to legacy charters history of losses legacy charter was historically unable to assume future taxable income in its analysis and accordingly valuation allowances were established against the deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities from definitelived assets for book accounting purposes however as a result of the twc transaction deferred tax liabilities resulting from the book fair value adjustment increased significantly and future taxable income that will result from the reversal of existing temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities are recognized is sufficient to conclude it is more likely than not that we will realize substantially all of our deferred tax assets as a result charter has reversed approximately  billion of its valuation allowance and recognized a corresponding income tax benefit in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december   approximately  million of valuation allowance associated with federal tax net operating loss carryforwards and approximately  million of valuation allowance associated with state tax loss carryforwards and other miscellaneous deferred tax assets remains on the december   consolidated balance sheet in determining our tax provision for financial reporting purposes charter establishes a reserve for uncertain tax positions unless such positions are determined to be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination based on their technical merits in evaluating whether a tax position has met the morelikelythannot recognition threshold we presume the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statements the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than  likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved there is considerable judgment involved in determining whether positions taken on the tax return are more likely than not of being sustained charter adjusts its uncertain tax reserve estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities as well as changes in tax    feb   c
