vanshap capital value fund lp returned  net of fees and expenses in the first quarter of  compared with  for the sp  and  for the msci world indices hellenic opportunity nathan mayer rothschild the londonbased family member of the eponymous banking dynasty famously suggested that “the time to buy is when theres blood in the streets” we observe that the roads in athens currently have a distinctive crimson sheen since the start of the political turmoil at the end of last year we have made a substantial investment in greek equities now amounting to  of fund assets among the headlines declaring a “grexit” all but inevitable we see substantial opportunity the cyclically adjusted price to earnings cape ratio of the greek equity market is currently just two the lowest in the world to our knowledge and onethird the multiple of russia and hungary considering the relative stability of democracy in the country we suspect such a valuation reflects the consensus view that greece’s exit from the eurozone is the likely result while not an infallible strategy purchasing equity securities in countries with low cape ratios has historically generated exceptional returns over the ensuing decade as individual securities analysts ourselves we have assembled a handful of what we believe are high quality wellmanaged businesses trading at exceptionally attractive valuations negotiations between greece and the eurozone have undoubtedly been lengthy and contentious we however continue to believe an agreement will eventually be struck—not only because the alternative could have dire consequences but because recent polls indicate the greek populous desires to remain in the currency union—regardless of the cost while the quoted prices of our securities will fluctuate based on the deluge of headlines surrounding the process we think fundamental analysis and rationality will return to the market over time top  holdings – march   company country market cap m  of fund  of company detrex corporation us    character group uk    public service properties uk    grivalia properties greece    kicking horse energy canada       and we are confident the valuations of our holdings will more properly reflect the intrinsic value of those enterprises the portfolio the largest detractors from performance in the quarter were detrex corporation otc dtrx  and  kicking horse energy cn kck  the largest contributors were  character group lon cct and  village main reef sj vil    the share price of detrex corporation has been significantly pressured presumably driven by a rather poor fourth quarter earnings result and lack of progress in the search for strategic alternatives while revenues did not change materially from the prior year profitability declined largely due to unfavorable product mix additionally costs increased due to higher investments in manufacturing and product development and expenses stemming from regulatory compliance the good news is that these investments appear to now be generating a return in late april the company announced first quarter revenues increased by  over the prior year and net income improved by  also in late april we were appointed to the company’s board of directors to represent our significant investment and the interests of all stakeholders please note that all comments regarding detrex corporation will continue to be restricted to publicly available information we look forward to assisting management and the board in their effort to “evaluate and embrace strategic opportunities to generate shareholder value” kicking horse has been greatly impacted by the steep decline in the price of crude oil we recently spoke with ceo steve harding who confirmed the company has no desire to squander its valuable petroleum resources and has therefore slashed development expenditures of the two rigs that were drilling for the company at the start of the year one was indefinitely released in january and the other in midfebruary for spring breakup but is likely to return later in the year with modest debt levels and relatively low development costs we expect kicking horse to be a survivor even in a prolonged downturn and to thrive once again should crude prices return to higher levels the growth of character group continued to settle into the market in the quarter resulting in a higher share price we took the opportunity to modestly reduce our ownership in the company after significant appreciation and increased although minimal investor excitement the shares are still valued at only x estimated fy cash earnings management continues to believe the share price does not accurately reflect the intrinsic value of the company and has therefore been repurchasing shares opportunistically in the market orders for the upcoming holiday season will begin later this summer and news until then is likely to be minimal village main reef sj vil  is slated to come to an end as we noted in our last letter the company received multiple offers for both individual assets and the entity as a whole and a financial adviser had been retained to manage a formal solicitation process in early february the board announced the company would be acquired by heavensent one of the    largest private equityventure capital firms in china—for  rand noticeably below our estimated fair value of  rand through subsequent conversations we learned that capital expenditures to extend the life of the tau lekoa gold mine would be higher than we had believed we expect the transaction to close within the next month or so though we have been reducing our position in the meantime over our roughly twoyear holding period we lost about  of the capital we invested in village main reef a disappointing result while roughly half the loss is attributable to the significant depreciation of the south african rand we nonetheless made numerous analytical errors first as we have noted in prior letters we drastically underestimated the liabilities that would ultimately stem from the closure of the buffels and blyvoor mines in a lower gold price environment second we should have been far more wary of what turned out to be a single asset commodity company operating in a highly volatile geography rife with strikes and other turbulence lastly and relatedly we should have more carefully considered investing in a small south african resources company regardless of the optically low valuation last quarter we wrote that public service properties investments ltd lon pspi  was “inching closer to liquidation” in the first quarter the company took a giant leap toward dissolution in midfebruary the board agreed to sell the troubled uk assets to tenant embrace for only £ million the sales price was at a significant discount to the stated net asset value and far below what we believed would be the ultimate value of the portfolio the alternative was less appealing than we thought a £ million upgrade of the properties with two or three years required for operational turnaround without any guarantee of an exit after concluding that the incremental return for assuming the risk was meager we voted to approve the disposal the result of our investment in public service was poor in our second quarter  letter we told you we estimated the conservative net asset value to be p per share assuming the renewal of domiciliary care contracts in liverpool we expect to receive just p per share in total proceeds over the two year holding period we will have earned virtually nothing after accounting for currency depreciation in hindsight we believe the initial investment thesis was reasonably sound but that the allocation was far too large we had closely analyzed the negotiating position of the company versus the tenant at the time and concluded that while not overwhelmingly strong the existence of alternative operators would result in an acceptable outcome for the assets the amount of capital required and the risk associated with those alternatives grew over time and ultimately proved unpalatable we expect the five remaining german care homes which are in relatively good shape compared to the uk properties to be liquidated over the coming months in the interim the board executed a compulsory stock redemption effectively returning £ million to shareholders—equivalent to about  of the market value thus public service has been reduced to a  position in the fund and will hopefully be nonexistent by yearend we recently met with second cup ltd cn scu  ceo alix box and
