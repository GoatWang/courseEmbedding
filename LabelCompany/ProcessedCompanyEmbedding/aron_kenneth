bank mortgage over their budget of  monthly when all alongthe bank knew that their bothincomes of governement incometotaled monthly of  at closing on for a new construction  housein the howard beach area of hamilton beach nyit was partly the fault of the bank approving such a high mortgage to begin with and the other half the fault of our builderthat made a breach of warranty contract refusing to make any house repairs from our flood house ins claims  thru jan   when the  police  hb fire dept founded over  counts of deadly carbon monixode in the unfinshed basement at that timewe had to try  live in a house that was safe and at that time we did not have the help ofour house builder under warrantyto do so and we just found out recently about a law that protects new construction homeowners in nys from exluding them to make any mortgage house payments due to the fact the house was not liveable called warranty of habitability lawwe hope that the freemans freedom of speech will tell the

extensive immigration process he is extremely knowledgeable unbelievably patient and tactful with people and he has an amazing personality mr weinman deserves not all the  rating stars but  and i will be very specific with you as i have been in the position of a person who reads tons of reviews looking for a good lawyer lets start with the fact that before hiring mr weinman i personally met with about  lawyers some of them even recommended by friends the problem was that i wasnt happy with any of them i worked for  years as a human resource specialist and i have the training to recognize the people that can get the job done frankly spoken some of the lawyers i met at that time were very convincing but i was also very wellprepared for my appointments with them and at the end they didnt seem to me either very competent or honest enough or something else was missing then i was browsing online reading different reviews and i found mr weinman there were several nice reviews and i decided to try with an initial appointment yet when you open the door you see that his office is organized in a manner that is only possible for someone confident knowledgeable and honest the next pleasant surprise was that he doesnt make you wait and he doesnt need to as he gains immediately the clients respect with his positive and honest approach and his extensive knowledge we discussed l visa h visa e and e and i decided to hire him right on the spot  months later i am so happy with my decision because he helped my mother then my father and then my best friend  out of  absolutely successful cases two of them i know were extremely difficult thank you mr weinman you are a true blessing for me and my family and for those of you who took the time to read my review i wish you just a little good luck because i know now that you will be in the hands of a great lawyerlaw office of ganesh n viswanathan esqmaria r ratedi am a woman from the caribbean island and even though i have been living here for a number of years i have had very little interaction with the court systems and litigation a person who is from the same islands married me a decade and half ago and we have a child after many years into the marriage i was not even aware he went ahead and filed for divorce over the years he has accumulated a lot of savings in pension plans and retirement funds and he is quite smart in understanding how the legal systems work i was not aware of any of his assets one day he filed for a divorce and then pretended as if nothing happened he never served on me directly but was devising a way to fool me by not serving but going ahead and obtaining a default order with no disclosure and no distribution to me i was naive but something in my mind was telling me something was not alright because my neighbors told me somebody like a process server came to my home in my absence i went and checked the court and to my horror i found out my husband filed a divorce action against me more than a year ago this is the time when i somehow came into contact mr viswanathans office and his office did a brilliant job in bringing into light everything that happened right on my back and explained everything to me my law office immediately moved the court and in detail put forth in the papers before the court everything that happened now my case proceeding very well far beyond my expectations i shall be entitled to a share in his assets further i am going to be entitled to a good spousal support and a child support i did not even imagine that i would be entitled to a penny from my husband all because of the great investigative legal work carried out by mr viswanathan and his excellent team i am now so happy because of their great work my husband whom i meet every week is sulking and the nature of his talk completely changed  for the betterthe law office of lance fletcherkurtnyc ratedstop looking around the internet and just read i just got a new job and my coworkers took me out for a celebration we went out for drinks and to make matters worse i started drinking shots big mistake because i had several im done with shots from this point on i got into a fight  apparently  i dont remember the details but i woke up in a cell with cuts and bruises i got charged with assault for hitting a guy and pushing him to the ground and resisting arrest and i thought my life was over because you cant get a good job with a record i was scared frustrated confused and i started looking around for a good lawyer to take my case i came across lance fletchers website and it looked pretty good you never know if that means its gonna be a good lawyer so i called him for a consultation when i went to see him i was a nervous reck and couldnt sleep i didnt want to lose my job or go to jail during the consultation we discussed similar cases hes had like mine turns out hes a former prosecutor and he really knew what he was talkin about after i saw him i had the best nights sleep since the arrest he looked me in the eye and explained how he was going to keep my record clean and fight the case most of the lawyers i spoke to just wanted money right away but mr fletcher was more interested in me and the case he took the time to meet and discuss the details on the first court date he filed a motion to dismiss he got a copy of the medical records saw that the other guy wasnt really hurt and got the da to drop the criminal charges i had to do a brief anger class but i avoided jail and no criminal record i got to keep my job and i cant thank him enough one thing  i wish i saw him sooner because my family tried to set me up with a lawyer but that guy didnt know what he was talking about and had me pretty scared turk hugh m jdperry ratedthere was little to no response not even taking two minutes to send a followup email or telephone call to my many inquiries for help with my case from one of the lawyers and his secretary of this firm the wheels of justice may move at a very slow pace yet apparently something else was going on here undoubtedly they are preoccupied with larger concerns however if certain people within this office are unable unwilling or uninterested in assisting the one who is inexperienced in legal matters perhaps with unrealistic expectations yet unfortunately forced into a legal circumstance though small in scope then simply say so but please do not ignore an individual for monthsespecially after promising to help initially you had given hope to this expunged criminal and after he pleaded again and again for assistance some action was finally taken now it appears it is all over the abusive unchecked and condescending authorities have won the incurring frustration seemingly endless wait as well as the expensive fees were paid by this innocent victim and despite the adversities and disappointments he will go on wishing well of authorities legal professionals and most of all hoping to be safeguarded

consultation would have cost over  for at the other lawyers i had reached out to as quoted in their emails i told him id like to continue working with him until the issue was solved and he became my savior through the whole process he worked with my roommates lawyer to settle the issues and kept me updated every step of the way even when i got nervous and would call him at random times during the day he took my call and would reassure me that he is on top of the situation and that he would continue to work on any other issues that arose with her when all the issues were resolved he stuck to
