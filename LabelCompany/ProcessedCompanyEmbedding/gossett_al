being courts of limited jurisdiction must examine their subjectmatter jurisdiction throughout the pendency of every matter before them childrens healthcare is a legal duty inc v deters  fd   th cir citations omitted emphasis in original plaintiffs allege four causes of action against byron products doc  ¶  these are  unlawful retaliation under  usc § h  unlawful retaliation against witnesses under  usc §   unlawful retaliation allegedly a tortious violation of ohio public policy and  unlawful retaliation under ohios whistleblower act ohio revised code annotated §   doc  this court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of all four causes of action in the complaint jurisdiction in this action is proper for count i pursuant to  usc § a  and count ii pursuant to  usc §  in that this action arises under the laws of the united states  usc §   jurisdiction is proper for counts iii and iv pursuant to  usc  in that the ohio state law claims are so related to the federal law claims that they form part of the same case or controversy  usc §   therefore the court has proper jurisdiction over this matter b standard of review the court reviews this motion to dismiss pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b contending that plaintiffs fail to state claims upon which relief can be granted fedrcivp b when considering a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b the court must construe plaintiffs complaint in the light most favorable to plaintiffs accepting all wellpleaded factual allegations in the complaint as true see scheuer v rhodes  us    sct    ledd   roth steel prod

unwarranted inferences which are presented as factual allegations blackburn v fisk univ  fd   th cir when considering the sufficiency of a complaint pursuant to a rule b motion the court will not dismiss a compliant for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief conley v gibson  us    sct    ledd   c analysis of motion to dismiss counts ii iii and iv the court will next decide defendants motion to dismiss counts ii iii and iv of plaintiffs amended complaint doc  the court will address count ii count iv and then address count iii  count ii violation of  usc §  plaintiffs allege a violation of  usc §  their response to the motion to dismiss clarifies that this claim is particularly under  usc §  the facts of this matter can be considered in light of the statute the statute  usc §  provides  obstructing justice intimidating party witness or juror if two or more persons in any state or territory conspire to deter by force intimidation or threat any party or witness in any court of the united states from attending such court or from testifying to any matter pending therein freely fully and truthfully or to injure such party or witness in his person or property on account of his having so attended or testified or to influence the verdict presentment or indictment of any grand or petit juror in any such court or to injure such juror in his person or property on account of any verdict presentment or indictment lawfully assented to by him or of his being or having been such juror or if two or more persons conspire for the purpose of impeding hindering obstructing or defeating in any manner the due course of justice in any state or territory with intent to deny to any citizen the equal protection of the laws or to injure him or his property for lawfully enforcing or attempting to enforce the right of any person or class of persons to the equal protection of the laws     usc §   plaintiffs amended complaint names one defendant byron products as defendant asserts since  usc §  requires a conspiracy between two or more persons defendant byron cannot conspire with itself admittedly one could construe the allegation that defendants management engaged in an ongoing pattern of behavior and consider management to be two or more persons this position fails too however since the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine provides that a corporation cannot conspire with its own employees as such a situation would be akin to conspiring with itself see doherty v american motors corp  fd   th cir see also johnson v hills  dales gen hosp  fd   th cir citing dombrowski v dowling  fd   th cir hull v cuyahoga valley joint vocational sch dist bd of educ  fd   th cir noting that if all of the defendants are members of the same collective entity there are not two separate people to form a conspiracy because plaintiffs have not alleged that two or more persons have conspired against them plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for which relief can be granted in count ii of their amended complaint therefore count ii of plaintiffs amended complaint will be dismissed  count iv claim under ohio revised code annotated §  defendants also assert that plaintiff gersbach brought her count iv claim under ohio revised code annotated §  out of time pursuant to ohio revised code annotated § d a civil action may be brought within onehundredeighty days after the date the disciplinary or retaliatory action was taken    in accordance with the rules of civil procedure ohio revcode ann § d  byron products terminated plaintiff gersbach on or about january   doc  the plaintiffs filed their claims october   doc  from the time of plaintiff gersbachs termination to the filing of her claim  days elapsed because plaintiff gersbach brought the claim more than  days after the termination plaintiff gersbachs count iv claim under ohio revised code annotated §  was brought out of time and must be dismissed because defendant byron did not terminate plaintiff gossett until april   however only  days ran against gossetts statute of limitations before plaintiffs filed the complaint doc  nevertheless defendant points out that plaintiff did not serve the original complaint on byron byron received plaintiffs amended complaint doc  on november    days after the alleged termination because plaintiffs complaint was sealed pursuant to  usc §  et seq  pursuant to ohio revised code annotated § d plaintiff gossett needed to bring his claim within one hundred eighty days after the date the disciplinary or retaliatory action was taken    in accordance with the rules of civil procedure ohio revcode ann § d the applicable federal and ohio civil rule states a civil action is commenced by filing a complaint ohio civ r   fedrcivp  despite the long period of time between the filing of the original complaint and service upon defendant byron plaintiff gossett did file his original complaint within the  day statute of limitations period of ohio revised code annotated § d as he filed the sealed complaint  days after his termination see us ex rel downy v corning inc  fsuppd   dnm  sealing a federal claims act complaint cuts off the running of the limitations period at the time of filing because plaintiff gersbach brought her count iv claim under ohio revised code annotated §  out of time the court will grant defendant byrons motion to dismiss plaintiff gersbachs count iv claim because plaintiff gossett brought his count iv claim under ohio revised code annotated §  within the  day time frame proscribed in ohio revised code annotated § d the court denies defendant byrons motion to dismiss plaintiff gossetts count iv claim  count iii ohio public policy tort claim plaintiffs count iii claim asserts a violation of ohio public policy in order to state a claim of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy a plaintiff must allege facts demonstrating that the employers act of discharging him contravened a clear public policy see greeley v miami valley maintenance contractors inc  ohio std   ned   whereas plaintiffs claimed violation of ohio revised code §  in count iv requires strict compliance with that statutes stipulated manner of whistleblowing including its day statute of limitations the ohio supreme court has held that an atwill employee may maintain a commonlaw publicpolicy claim regardless of whether the employee has complied with the whistleblower statute if he can identify a source of public policy separate from the public policy embodied in rc  kulch v structural fibers  ohio std   ned   an employee can base the clear public policy on ohio law the constitution of ohio or the united states administrative rules and regulations or the common law kulch v structural fibers  ohio std   ned    in the instant case plaintiffs assert a duty under various provisions of federal and state law including but not limited to to refrain from discriminating against employees who assist in proceedings to carry out the purposes of the federal and state laws doc  ¶  plaintiffs later describe this duty as one to refrain from taking retaliatory actions against employees who take lawful actions in furtherance of a false claims act action including investigation for testimony for or assistance in an action filed under this section and testimony in case and court proceedings id at ¶  a common law claim of violation of public policy however requires a source of public policy separate from the public policy embodied in rc  kulch v structural fibers  ohio std   ned   plaintiffs response does not point to any source for the public policy it asserts see doc  at  the court will consider the possibility of  usc § h as a source for this policy this statute requires employers to refrain from retaliation against employees who take lawful actions in furtherance of a false claims act action  usc § h  proceedings in furtherance of a false claims act action however are just a subset of the types of actions protected by ohio revised code §  which prohibits employer retaliation for reporting a violation of any law by ones company or fellow employees ohio rev code §  the policy established in  usc § h and the policy stated in plaintiffs count iii are thus substantially similar to ohio revised code §  thus there is no independent common law action as claimed in count iii the court will thus grant defendants motion to dismiss count iii iv conclusion defendant byrons motion to dismiss counts ii iii and iv of the plaintiffs amended complaint doc  is granted in part and denied in part pursuant to fedrcivp b the court grants the motion with respect to plaintiffs count ii claims because plaintiffs did not allege two or more persons conspired against them because plaintiff gersbach brought her claims out of time according to ohio revised code § d the court also grants the motion with respect to plaintiff gersbachs count iv claims but denies the motion with regard gossett who brought his claim in time the court grants the motion with respect to plaintiffs count iii because the public policy that count iii alleges to have been violated is protected by ohio revised code §  done and ordered in dayton ohio this friday december   footnotes  the court acknowledges the

requires a source of public policy separate from the public policy embodied in rc  kulch v structural fibers  ohio st d   ned   plaintiffs response does not point to any source for the public policy it asserts see doc  at  the court will consider the possibility of  usc § h as a source for this policy this statute requires employers to refrain from retaliation against employees who take lawful actions in furtherance of a false claims act action  usc § h  proceedings in furtherance of a false claims act action however are just a subset of the types of actions protected by ohio revised code §  which prohibits employer retaliation for reporting a violation of any law by ones company or fellow employees ohio rev code §  the policy established in  usc § h and the policy stated in plaintiffs count iii are thus substantially similar to ohio revised code §  thus there is no independent common law action as claimed in count iii the court will thus grant defendants motion to dismiss count iii iv conclusion defendant byrons motion to dismiss counts ii iii and iv of the plaintiffs amended complaint doc  is granted in part and denied in part pursuant to fedrcivp b the court grants the motion with respect to plaintiffs count ii claims because plaintiffs did not allege two or more persons conspired against them because plaintiff gersbach brought her claims out of time according to ohio revised code § d the court also grants the motion with respect to plaintiff gersbachs count iv claims but denies the motion with regard gossett who brought his claim in time the court grants the motion with respect to plaintiffs count iii because the public policy that count iii alleges to have been violated is protected by ohio revised code §  done and ordered in dayton ohio  this friday
