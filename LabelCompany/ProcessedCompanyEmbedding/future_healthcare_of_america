richard worzel keynote speeches workshops  seminars innovation sessions futurist faq future studies bibliography contact  booking keynote topics browse by topic articles  books futuresearch blog blog articles conference handouts subscribe to blog testimonials futurist faq whats a futurist lets start by saying what a futurist is not a futurist is not someone who tells the future we dont read tea leaves tarot cards crystal balls or tell fortunes those who confuse us with soothsayers have never had any dealings with a futurist instead a futurist is someone who spends time thinking about what might happen in the future and especially what are the forces at work that will shape and affect our futures this is not magic it merely takes time and effort a professional futurist is someone who takes time to research study and think about the future just as a biologist is someone who takes time to research study and think about biology the end result of a futurists efforts is or should be a better understanding of the future so that it is easier to make intelligent plans about the future in short then a futurist is a planner not a prophet are there any futurists i might have heard of the earliest futurists i became aware of when i was in university in the late s were buckminster fuller and herman kahn shortly thereafter alvin toffler hit the bestseller list with future shock  more recently john naisbett and patricia aburdene came to international prominance with their bestseller megatrends there are lots of other futurists including richard lamm former governor of the state of colorado science and science fiction writer arthur c clarke american vicepresident al gore and the grand high poohbah of management science fiction peter drucker these are not necessarily the best futurists but they are probably the best known futurists within the futurist community there are a large number of people who are experts in a wide range of fields in all i understand that there are something like  members of the world future society of these perhaps  are professional futurists who make their living this way so while futurists may not be common neither are we an endangered species how do you predict the future i dont its not my job to predict the future indeed i dont think that anybody can accurately and consistently predict the future instead its my job to help people plan intelligently for the future i do this by trying to anticipate what might happen what early warning signs to look for and then help people create contingency plans to deal with these possibilities all right how do you anticipate the future there are several specific future studies techniques which will only be touched on here an environmental scan is just that watching what is happening elsewhere to see if it has relevance to you and what you do hence for instance social trends often start in northern europe before reaching north america within north america they often start on the west coast frequently in the san francisco area scenario planners dissect the future into major forces then try to decide how each force might change the status quo their ultimate objective is to produce from two to five different scenarioes that they feel portray the major possibilities for the future along with the telltales or early warning indicators that will help you decide which future is likely to come to pass there are other tools as well that are less widely used from complexity theory to delphi techniques however at the end all of these have one central shared feature those who use any of these techniques must be wellinformed about what is happening now and they must be able to think clearly and coherently about what the next logical consequences might be therefore the simple answer to how do you do it is learn widely and think well it must be pretty easy talking about things that might happen  years from now whos going to remember since im not trying to predict the future i dont worry about whether people remember what i said  years ago although ive done pretty well looking back instead i hold myself to a higher standard when im finished speaking with you have i changed the way you perceive the future think about the future and prepare for the future if so then ive done my job whether it turns out  years from now that i was right you should be able to tell when i walk out of the room whether i did my job its a subjective measure and its your call in the s futurists were predicting that by the s wed all be working  hour weeks taking  weeks vacation a year flying personal helicopters vacationing on the moon and having our housework done by robots what happened actually it was the popular press that predicted these things not the then fledgling futurist community however dealing with the predictions themselves several things were overlooked first concerning the amount of time wed spend working we forgot one crucial thing the future described in this question is the one i describe as the george jetson future george jetson worked at spacely sprockets arriving at his office around  sitting with his feet up on his desk until lunch then pushing a button and going home nobody thought to ask the question that if pushing a button once a day was all that george jetson did for a living then why would spacely sprockets need george jetson in the first place the implications of that overlooked question go a long way towards describing why we arent working a  hour week  and why those of us who are working feel like were working more hours not less the combination of automation and competition of the rapidly developing countries is changing the face and nature of work  as described in my  book facing the future robots are here but theyre used mostly in very restricted industrial applications not for doing household chores it turns out that human beings are far more flexible adaptable and far smarter than we ever imagined  as we found out when we started serious work on robots there are several major issues in robotics that are going to have to be solved before we can have jetsonlike robot servants and the solution to these problems is not especially close at hand as far as i know chief among these issues are vision the ability to distinguish what is being seen in a camera lens movement the ability to discriminate between objects within the field of view and to avoid obstacles in the real world and durability the ability to survive in hot or cold dry or damp and dusty and dirty environments there are several other problems as well helicopters replacing cars was more of a mad magazine fantasy than a realistic expectation people forgot just how complex a task it is to fly even a fixed wing airplane and helicopters are probably the most difficult of all flying machines to master it takes a lot more work than learning to drive a car and most people dont see the value in doing so as for vacationing on the moon im just as disappointed as you are  maybe moreso as ive always wanted to visit the moon or luna as we science fiction fans typically call it the reasons for the disappointment are nasa the us congress and public opinion nasa wasted billions of dollars on what amounted to public relations gimmicks and did it in typical bungling bureaucratic fashion an elephant is a mouse built to government specifications worse when they did get results they threw them away as soon as public interest and hence congressional funding started to wane just as the apollo missions for example were starting to produce significant scientific information on selenology the lunar counterpart to geology congress cut funding for the space program and nasa stopped sending missions to the moon my view about a manned personed mission to mars are along these lines its a public relations stunt and little more there are more valuable objectives in space exploitation closer to home how do you make your living as a futurist as a futurist i make my living by consulting writing and speaking i consult to organizations and associations that want someone to help them plan for the future for more information about my activities see professional services hence for the major telecommunications companies in canada through the stentor resource centre i worked with a group of other professionals in trying to identify how the communications industry was going to change over the next two decades for the same group i also worked with a grade eight class of children helping them learn brainstorming techniques and facilitating their thoughts and ideas about the future the whole process took more than six months at the other end of the spectrum i do keynote speeches for companies and industry associations the shortest of these has been  minutes in length for the soap  detergent association of the united states this presentation was tightly scripted videotaped using special effectsand kicked off a halfday satellite broadcast to about  people across north america a more normal speech might be from an hour to an hour and a half i also do seminars and workshops that last from half a day to a full weekend retreat and will tailor such events to the organization and their objectives over the course of a year i speak to something on the order of  people in the united states and canada at between  and  events keynote speeches workshops  seminars innovation sessions futurist faq future studies bibliography speakertracker contact  booking subscribe to mailing list

new healthcare economy  trends to watchbob moritzjan  in his state of the union address tuesday night president obama was brief but to the point on healthcare declaring that about “ million uninsured americans finally gained the security of health coverage” because of the affordable care act he made clear he would veto any legislative attempt to roll it back thus absent judicial action the act is here to stay politics notwithstanding this means the healthcare industry’s remarkable ongoing transformation in the face of significant disruption will also continuesimply put government action combined with market forces is creating a business case study we should all be reading even as it’s still being writtento be sure healthcare is one of many industries facing significant disruption in pwc’s recently published th annual global ceo survey us ceos identified various trends that they believe will be very disruptive for their industries overall  agreed that their companies face more threats to their growth today than three years ago at the same time however these ceos see substantial potential amidst the disruption –  agreed that there are more growth opportunities today than three years agowith this broader perspective in mind let’s take a close look at the health sectorrelatedmost powerful womenno women at the bbc aren’t to blame for their own gender pay gapmost powerful womenno women at the bbc aren’t to blame for their own gender pay gapat  trillion the state of the us healthcare industry is strong—and growing in his speech the president pointed out that health care inflation is at its lowest rate in  years those  million newly insured americans are bringing in significant new revenue but that’s only part of the story the health sector is proving to be highly adaptive to disruption and innovation while also evidencing how the public sector and private sector can join together to accelerate market forces beyond a rate anyone foresaw although consumers’ demands for greater roles in their healthcare decisions and purchasers’ demands for reduced costs existed preaca the landmark legislation turbocharged these market forcesthree aspects stand outfirst the most startling metamorphosis over the last few years is the fastpaced transformation of health insurance into a true retail industry the combination of the public and private exchanges new market entrants and millions of new customers is fostering fierce competition over quality and price the result is an industry that is increasingly responsive to its customerssecond employerprovided insurance remains our nation’s health insurance bedrock despite the alternatives offered by the aca with only some exceptions employers continue to provide their employees with insurance and in many instances are the leading innovators in devising highquality lowercost carethird employers and consumers aided by the aca’s incentives are pushing the market to emphasize value and outcomes compared with the outdated focus on volume as a result insurers are focused on health outcomes for patient populations providers are changing how they care for patients and pharmaceutical and medical device companies are changing their investment and product development strategies all the while healthcare consumers are benefittingit’s important to examine how industry players are driving these changes and what strategies current and future market actors will need i want to highlight three key trends in the new healthcare economy  significantly these topics are also on the front burner for us ceos in other sectorsfirst partnerships are increasingly important to success in today’s hypercompetitive environment companies must collaborate on innovative products and services combining complementary expertise to fill individual gaps the top issues report reveals that  of fortune  companies pursued new healthcare partnerships in  and that  of consumers would be more likely to choose a healthcare company that partnered with others to improve servicesgiven my focus on healthcare today there is one strikingly disappointing number – that only  of us ceos are engaged in or contemplating partnering with government as a result of the act a significant part of healthcare today is governmentprivate sector partnerships in different forms the foremost examples are the public exchanges in which private companies are competing in a governmentestablished structure then of course there are hundreds of millions of dollars in grants and incentives that government is providing and that the private sector is using to innovate – to experiment with care delivery develop new technology study population health and other areassecond digital technology is a crucial focus now and for the future for example consumers want more doityourself health options and entrepreneurs are obliging rapid innovation is everywhere from the growth of the wearables market to mobile apps to fdaapproved digital medical devices indeed in the first  months of  alone the fda cleared  of these devicesthe heavy emphasis on digital technology is not unique to the healthcare industry eightyeight percent of the us ceos we surveyed said digital technology was strategically important for data mining and analytics and  for customer engagement moreover  said digital technology was creating value in operational efficiency and customer engagementthird securing consumer data and ensuring privacy will be central to healthcare companies’ successes while the top issues report revealed that more than  of consumers would be willing to share data to improve care coordination and nearly  would do so to support realtime decisionmaking privacy is a major concern more than  of consumers said data security was more important to them than convenient access to imaging and test results doctors’ notes diagnoses and prescriptionsnot just business but government and society writ large must do better to facilitate these partnerships—the health care industry illustrates how they can work if all three increasingly step up to the plate in the health and other industries the potential benefits are incrediblebob
