fund directory  navigating global bond markets navigating global bond markets    the global bond markets are changing the global bond market is undergoing a series of profound changes challenging the traditional role of income and stability that bonds have played and creating new opportunities we believe investors should understand these changes and adapt their portfolios to the new fixedincome landscape interest rates may challenge investors opportunities exist across the globe across the spectrum divergence in global growth lower liquidity may mean higher volatility can your portfolio keep up we believe investors should consider dynamic and flexible fixed income investments that attempt to neutralize or even benefit from rising interest rates investors should also consider strategies that seek value across all sectors of the global fixed income market allowing them to diversify geographically and take advantage of diverging growth patterns  overall investors may prefer highly

volatility in  however we still see opportunities in select areas and relative value strategies where we see value in high yield bonds we believe select areas of the highyield bond market can offer attractive compensation relative to today’s increased fundamental risk three reasons to consider global bonds now having a purely domestic bond exposure may have served investors well in the past but
