french german greek hebrew hungarian indonesian italian japanese korean lithuanian persian polish portuguese portuguese brazilian romanian russian serbian spanish swedish thai turkish vietnamese  this is my first time at ted normally as an advertising man i actually speak at ted evil which is teds secret sister that pays all the bills its held every two years in burma and i particularly remember a really good speech by kim jong il on how to get teens smoking again laughter  but actually its suddenly come to me after years working in the business that what we create in advertising which is intangible value — you might call it perceived value you might call it badge value subjective value intangible value of some kind — gets rather a bad rap if you think about it if you want to live in a world in the future where there are fewer material goods you basically have two choices you can either live in a world which is poorer which people in general dont like or you can live in a world where actually intangible value constitutes a greater part of overall value that actually intangible value in many ways is a very very fine substitute for using up labor or limited resources in the creation of things  here is one example this is a train which goes from london to paris the question was given to a bunch of engineers about  years ago how do we make the journey to paris better and they came up with a very good engineering solution which was to spend six billion pounds building completely new tracks from london to the coast and knocking about  minutes off a threeandhalfhour journey time now call me mister picky im just an ad man   but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey merely to make it shorter now what is the hedonic opportunity cost on spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks  here is my naive advertising mans suggestion what you should in fact do is employ all of the worlds top male and female supermodels pay them to walk the length of the train handing out free chateau petrus for the entire duration of the journey laughter applause now youll still have about three billion pounds left in change and people will ask for the trains to be slowed down laughter  now here is another naive advertising mans question again and this shows that engineers medical people scientific people have an obsession with solving the problems of reality when actually most problems once you reach a basic level of wealth in society most problems are actually problems of perception so ill ask you another question what on earth is wrong with placebos they seem fantastic to me they cost very little to develop they work extraordinarily well they have no side effects or if they do theyre imaginary so you can safely ignore them laughter  so i was discussing this and i actually went to the marginal revolution blog by tyler cowen i dont know if anybody knows it someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further and actually produce placebo education the point is that education doesnt actually work by teaching you things it actually works by giving you the impression that youve had a very good education which gives you an insane sense of unwarranted selfconfidence which then makes you very very successful in later life so welcome to oxford ladies and gentlemen laughter applause  but actually the point of placebo education is interesting how many problems of life can be solved actually by tinkering with perception rather than that tedious hardworking and messy business of actually trying to change reality heres a great example from history ive heard this attributed to several other kings but doing a bit of historical research it seems to be fredrick the great fredrick the great of prussia was very very keen for the germans to adopt the potato and to eat it because he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate wheat and potatoes you get less price volatility in bread and you get a far lower risk of famine because you actually had two crops to fall back on not one  the only problem is potatoes if you think about it look pretty disgusting and also th century prussians ate very very few vegetables — rather like contemporary scottish people laughter so actually he tried making it compulsory the prussian peasantry said we cant even get the dogs to eat these damn things they are absolutely disgusting and theyre good for nothing there are even records of people being executed for refusing to grow potatoes  so he tried plan b he tried the marketing solution which is he declared the potato as a royal vegetable and none but the royal family could consume it and he planted it in a royal potato patch with guards who had instructions to guard over it night and day but with secret instructions not to guard it very well laughter now th century peasants know that there is one pretty safe rule in life which is if something is worth guarding its worth stealing before long there was a massive underground potatogrowing operation in germany what hed effectively done is hed rebranded the potato it was an absolute masterpiece  i told this story and a gentleman from turkey came up to me and said very very good marketer fredrick the great but not a patch on ataturk ataturk rather like nicolas sarkozy was very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil in turkey to modernize it now boring people would have just simply banned the veil but that would have ended up with a lot of awful kickback and a hell of a lot of resistance ataturk was a lateral thinker he made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil laughter applause  i cant verify that fully but it does not matter there is your environmental problem solved by the way guys all convicted child molesters have to drive a porsche cayenne laughter what ataturk realized actually is two very fundamental things which is that actually first one all value is actually relative all value is perceived value  for those of you who dont speak spanish jugo de naranja — its actually the spanish for orange juice because actually its not the dollar its actually the peso in buenos aires very clever buenos aires street vendors decided to practice price discrimination to the detriment of any passing gringo tourists as an advertising man i have to admire that  but the first thing is that all value is subjective second point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion these funny signs that flash your speed at you some of the new ones on the bottom right now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face to act as an emotional trigger whats fascinating about these signs is they cost about  percent of the running cost of a conventional speed camera but they prevent twice as many accidents so the bizarre thing which is baffling to conventional classically trained economists is that a weird little smiley face has a better effect on changing your behavior than the threat of a £ fine and three penalty points  tiny little behavioral economics detail in italy penalty points go backwards you start with  and they take them away because they found that loss aversion is a more powerful influence on peoples behavior in britain we tend to feel whoa got another three not so in italy  another fantastic case of creating intangible value to replace actual or material value which remember is what after all the environmental movement needs to be about this again is from prussia from i think about   the wealthy prussians to help in the war against the french were encouraged to give in all their jewelry and it was replaced with replica jewelry made of cast iron heres one gold gab ich für eisen  the interesting thing is that for  years hence the highest status jewelry you could wear in prussia wasnt made of gold or diamonds it was made of cast iron because actually never mind the actual intrinsic value of having gold jewelry this actually had symbolic value badge value it said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past  so the modern equivalent would of course be this laughter but actually there is a thing just as there are veblen goods where the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare — there are opposite kind of things where actually the value in them depends on them being ubiquitous classless and minimalistic  if you think about it shakerism was a protoenvironmental movement adam smith talks about th century america where the prohibition against visible displays of wealth was so great it was almost a block in the economy in new england because even wealthy farmers could find nothing to spend their money on without incurring the displeasure of their neighbors its perfectly possible to create these social pressures which lead to more egalitarian societies  whats also interesting if you look at products that have a high component of what you might call messaging value a high component of intangible value versus their intrinsic value they are often quite egalitarian in terms of dress denim is perhaps the perfect example of something which replaces material value with symbolic value cocacola a bunch of you may be a load of pinkos and you may not like the cocacola company but its worth remembering andy warhols point about coke what warhol said about coke is he said what i really like about cocacola is the president of the united states cant get a better coke than the bum on the corner of the street now that is actually when you think about it — we take it for granted — its actually a remarkable achievement to produce something thats that democratic  now we basically have to change our views slightly there is a basic view that real value involves making things involves labor it involves engineering it involves limited raw materials and that what we add on top is kind of false its a fake version and there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it it patently veers toward propaganda however what we do have now is a much more variegated media ecosystem in which to kind of create this kind of value and its much fairer  when i grew up this was basically the media environment of my childhood as translated into food you had a monopoly supplier on the left you have rupert murdoch or the bbc laughter and on your right you have a dependent public which is pathetically grateful for anything you give it laughter  nowadays the user is actually involved this is actually whats called in the digital world usergenerated content although its called agriculture in the world of food laughter this is actually called a mashup where you take content that someone else has produced and you do something new with it in the world of food we call it cooking this is food  which is food you produce for the purpose of sharing it with other people this is mobile food british are very good at that fish and chips in newspaper the cornish pasty the pie the sandwich we invented the whole lot of them were not very good at food in general italians do great food but its not very portable generally laughter  i only learned this the other day the earl of sandwich didnt invent the sandwich he actually invented the toasty but then the earl of toasty would be a ridiculous name laughter  finally we have contextual communication now the reason i show you pernod — its only one example every country has a contextual alcoholic drink in france its pernod it tastes great within the borders of that country but absolute shite if you take it anywhere else laughter unicum in hungary for example the greeks have actually managed to produce something called retsina which even tastes shite when youre in greece laughter  but so much communication now is contextual that the capacity for actually nudging people for giving them better information — bj fogg at the university of stanford makes the point that actually the mobile phone is — hes invented the phrase persuasive technologies he believes the mobile phone by being locationspecific contextual timely and immediate is simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented  now if we have all these tools at our disposal we simply have to ask the question and thaler and sunstein have of how we can use these more intelligently ill give you one example if you had a large red button of this kind on the wall of your home and every time you pressed it it saved  dollars for you put  dollars into your pension you would save a lot more the reason is that the interface fundamentally determines the behavior okay  now marketing has done a very very good job of creating opportunities for impulse buying yet weve never created the opportunity for impulse saving if you did this more people would save more its simply a question of changing the interface by which people make decisions and the very nature of the decisions changes obviously i dont want people to do this because as an advertising man i tend to regard saving as just consumerism needlessly postponed laughter but if anybody did want to do that thats the kind of thing we need to be thinking about actually fundamental opportunities to change human behavior  now ive got an example here from canada there was a young intern at ogilvy canada called hunter somerville who was working in improv in toronto and got a parttime job in advertising and was given the job of advertising shreddies now this is the most perfect case of creating intangible added value without changing the product in the slightest shreddies is a strange square wholegrain cereal only available in new zealand canada and britain its krafts peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown laughter in working out how you could relaunch shreddies he came up with this  video buzzer man shreddies is supposed to be square laughter  woman have any of these diamond shapes gone out laughter  voiceover new diamond shreddies cereal same  percent wholegrain wheat in a delicious diamond shape applause  rory sutherland im not sure this isnt the most perfect example of intangible value creation all it requires is photons neurons and a great idea to create this thing i would say its a work of genius but naturally you cant do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research  man so shreddies is actually producing a new product which is something very exciting for them so they are introducing new diamond shreddies laughter so i just want to get your first impressions when you see that when you see the diamond shreddies box there laughter  woman werent they square  woman  im a little bit confused woman  they look like the squares to me  man they — yeah its all in the appearance but its kind of like flipping a six or a nine like a six if you flip it over it looks like a nine but a six is very different from a nine  woman   or an m and a w man an m and a w exactly  man  unclear you just looked like you turned it on its end but when you see it like that its more interesting looking  man just try both of them take a square one there first laughter man which one did you prefer man  the first one  man the first one laughter  rory sutherland now naturally a debate raged there were conservative elements in canada unsurprisingly who actually resented this intrusion so eventually the manufacturers actually arrived at a compromise which was the combo pack laughter applause laughter  if you think its funny bear in mind there is an organization called the american institute of wine economics which actually does extensive research into perception of things and discovers that except for among perhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people there is no correlation between quality and enjoyment in wine except when you tell the people how expensive it is in which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more so drink your wine blind in the future  but this is both hysterically funny — but i think an important philosophical point which is going forward we need more of this kind of value we need to spend more time appreciating what already exists and less time agonizing over what else we can do  two quotations to more or less end with one of them is poetry is when you make new things familiar and familiar things new which isnt a bad definition of what our job is to help people appreciate what is unfamiliar but also to gain a greater appreciation and place a far higher value on those things which are already existing there is some evidence by the way that things like social networking help do that because they help people share news they give badge value to everyday little trivial activities so they actually reduce the need for actually spending great money on display and increase the kind of thirdparty enjoyment you can get from the smallest simplest things in life which is magic  the second one is the second gk chesterton quote of this session which is we are perishing for want of wonder not for want of wonders which i think for anybody involved in technology is perfectly true and a final thing when you place a value on things like health love sex and other things and learn to place a material value on what youve previously discounted for being merely intangible a thing not seen you realize youre much much wealthier than you ever imagined thank you very much indeed applause advertising adds value to a product by changing our perception rather than the product itself rory sutherland makes the daring assertion that a change in perceived value can be just as satisfying as what we consider “real” value — and his conclusion has interesting consequences for how we look at life about the speaker rory sutherland · advertising guru rory sutherland stands at the center of an
