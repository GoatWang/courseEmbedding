administrative expenses segment adjusted ebitda is a key component of consolidated ebitda which is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors commercial banks research analysts and others we believe that the presentation of ebitda provides useful information to investors regarding our performance and results of operations because ebitda when used in conjunction with related gaap financial measures i provides additional information about our core operating performance and ability to generate and distribute

rating agencies and debt holders have indicated is useful in assessing us and our results of operations segment adjusted ebitda is also used as a supplemental financial measure by our management for reasons similar to those stated in the previous explanation of ebitda in addition the exclusion of corporate general and administrative expenses from consolidated segment adjusted ebitda allows
