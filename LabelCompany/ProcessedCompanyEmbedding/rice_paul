so many ways rice can be used raw or cooked and can be processed into everything from vinegar to wine milk to cosmetics read to learn more about this amazing grain raw rice may be ground into flour for many uses including making many kinds of beverages such as amazake horchata rice milk and sake rice flour does not contain gluten and is suitable for people on a glutenfree diet rice may also be made into various types of noodles raw wild or brown rice may also be consumed by rawfoodists or fruitarians if soaked and sprouted processed rice seeds must be boiled or steamed before eating cooked rice may be further fried in oil or butter or even added to other foods meatloaf hamburgers as a binding agent in place of products containing gluten rice is a good source of protein and a staple food in many parts of the world but it is not a complete protein it does not contain all of the essential amino acids in sufficient amounts for good health and should be combined with other sources of protein such as nuts seeds beans or meat rice like other cereal grains can be puffed or popped this process takes advantage of the grains’ water content and typically involves heating grains in a special chamber rice bran is a valuable commodity in asia and is used for many daily needs it is a moist oily inner layer which when heated produces an oil wait there’s more what will rice do next rice vinegar is most popular in the cuisines of east and southeast asia it is available in white light yellow red and black varieties the japanese prefer a light more delicate rice vinegar for the preparation of sushi rice and salad dressings red rice vinegar traditionally is coloured with red yeast rice although some chinese brands use artificial food colouring instead black rice vinegar made with black glutinous rice is most popular in china although it also is produced in japan it may be used as a substitute for balsamic vinegar although its dark colour and the fact that it is aged may be the only similarity between the two products some varieties of rice vinegar are sweetened or otherwise seasoned with spices or other added flavorings rice wine is an alcoholic beverage made from rice unlike wine which is made by fermentation of naturally sweet grapes and other fruit rice wine results from the fermentation of rice starch converted to sugars this process is akin to that used to produce beer however beer production employs a mashing process to convert starch to sugars whereas rice wine uses the different amylolytic process rice brew typically has a higher alcohol content – than wine – which in turn has a higher alcohol content than beer – some types of rice wine amakaze  lowalcohol japanese rice drink brem  balinese rice wine cheongju  korean rice wine choujiu  a milky

sake is also referred to in english as japanese rice wine which is not entirely accurate wine is made from the single fermentation of plant juices other than sparkling wine or champagne which can be a double fermentation to create the carbonation sake is produced by multiple fermentation of rice which is similar to the way beer is produced rice milk is a kind of grain milk processed from rice it is mostly made from brown rice and commonly unsweetened the sweetness in most rice milk varieties is generated by a natural enzymatic process dividing the carbohydrates into sugars—especially glucose some rice milk may nevertheless be sweetened with sugarcane syrup or other sugars compared with cow’s milk rice milk contains more carbohydrates does not contain either significant amounts of calcium or protein and no cholesterol or lactose commercial brands of rice milk are typically fortified with vitamins and minerals including calcium vitamin b vitamin b and iron many people are either allergic or otherwise sensitive to dairy and soy making rice milk an easy and nutritious alternative rice milk is made by pressing the rice through a mill stream using osmosis to strain out the pressed grains it can also be made simply and easily at home with a food processor recipes chorizo pepper and rice stuffing this fragrant and flavourful stuffing variation is sure to become a holiday

expedition chef pauls smoked meats chef pauls recipes chef paul prudhommes  louisiana kitchen cookbook chef paul prudhommes louisiana kitchen chef pauls  groundbreaking book brought the flavors and cooking styles of his native south louisiana to the attention of the nation and started a trend that continues today chef paul prudhommes first cookbook has been called the best louisiana regional american cookbook ever published chef paul shares his secrets for the very best cooking from old favorites like seafood gumbo with andouille smoked sausage shrimp creole turtle soup chicken and tasso jambalaya cajun popcorn crawfish etouffée blackened prime rib and sweet potato pecan piepeople often ask me whats the difference between cajun and creole cooking cajun and creole cuisines share many similarities both are louisiana born with french roots but cajun is very old french cooking cajun food began in southern france moved on to nova scotia and then came to louisiana the acadians adapted their dishes to use ingredients that grew wild in the area  bay leaves from the laurel tree filé powder from the sassafras tree and an abundance of different peppers such as cayenne tabasco peppers banana peppers and birdseye peppers that grow wild in south louisiana  learning their uses from the native indians the evolution of creole cooking just like cajun has depended heavily on whatever foods have been available but creole food unlike cajun began in new orleans and is a mixture of the traditions of french spanish italian american indian african and other ethnic groups seven flags flew over new orleans in the early days and each time a new nation took over many members of the deposed government would leave the city most of the cooks and other servants stayed behind the position of cook was highly esteemed and the best paid position in the household those cooks most of whom were black would be hired by other families often of a different nationality of course the cooks would have to change their style of cooking over a period of time they learned how to cook for a variety of nationalities and they incorporated their own spicy homestyle way of cooking into the different cuisines of their employers this is the way creole food was created creole cooking is more sophisticated and complex than cajun cooking  its city cookingtoday in homes there is still a distinction between cajun and creole cooking in restaurants little distinction remains thats why i refer to the two together as one  louisiana cookingchef paul prudhommeto use magic seasoning blends® in recipes found in chef paul prudhommes louisiana kitchen cookbook simply add up the amount of dry herbs and spices called for in the recipes seasoning mix substitute approximately the same amount of the appropriate blend for example if you were doing a chicken dish youd substitute poultry magic® for the herbs and spices in the cookbook if a recipe calls for a sweet spice or an unusual ingredient subtract the amount of sweet or unusual spice prior to adding up the dry herb seasoning mix then add back the subtracted ingredients to the magic seasoning blends® amount required for the conversion
