expects to remain marginally profitable this year it sees better days ahead matthew dilallo tmfmd jul   at am oceaneering internationals nyseoii financial results bounced back in the second quarter after the company reported a meager profit and ended a string of losses while the company expects further improvement in the back half of the year it still doesnt expect to report more than a marginal profit for the full year because of the continued pressure on the offshore drilling sector oceaneering results the raw numbers metric q  q  yearoveryear change revenue  million  million  adjusted net income  million  million nm adjusted eps   nm data source oceaneering international image source getty images what happened with oceaneering this quarter  oceaneerings results bounced back off the bottom revenue from the companys remotely operated vehicles rov segment was up  from the first quarter to  million though it was down  year over year driving the sequential improvement was higher utilization due in part to retiring four rovs during the quarter while only putting one new rov into service that rise in revenue along with a slight improvement in margin drove operating income up  versus last quarter though its still down more than  from last years second quarter subsea products revenue rose  from last quarter to  million though its still down  from the yearago quarter furthermore despite the sequential improvement in revenue operating income still fell due to the continued weakness and competitive nature of the service and rental market the subsea projects segment was one of the brighter spots delivering a  increase in revenue to  million because of seasonal improvements in the gulf of mexico that helped fuel an eyecatching  surge in operating income though thats off a meager base last quarter asset integritys sales were up  to  million primarily due to seasonality which also drove an increase in operating income finally the advanced technology segment delivered a  increase in revenue which came in at  million for the quarter because of increased commercial activity and work for the us navy that sparked a more than  improvement in operating income what management had to say  recently installed ceo rod larson commented on the companys secondquarter results noting that  our overall operating results during the quarter were in line with expectations we were pleased that each of our operating segments remained profitable on a consolidated basis for the first half of  we have generated  million of ebitda and  million of free cash flow we believe our cash flow and liquidity position us well to manage our business through the continuing industry downturn at the end of the quarter we had  million in cash and an undrawn  million revolving credit facility based on these strengths the board maintained our current dividend rate and declared a  per share dividend to be paid during the third quarter of  as larson noted the company continues to navigate through the challenging market environment by keeping its costs down so it can generate cash and strengthen its financial position this improving liquidity gives it the flexibility to pursue opportunities that may emerge to grow our company according to larson in particular he noted that oceaneering is focusing its attention on capturing more of the operating expenditures of its customers in the production phase as opposed to its current focus on exploration drilling that should provide the company with a more stable revenue stream if its successful in securing those opportunities looking forward  oceaneering announced that it was successful in securing several longerterm contracts during the quarter it won a threeyear contract with norways statoil nysesto to develop and implement an inspection and maintenance program at  of its facilities furthermore statoil can expand that agreement to other fields in the future meanwhile royal dutch shell nyserdsa nyserdsb awarded the company a products and services contract relating to its appomattox development in the gulf shell expects to start the project later this year and should complete it sometime in  these contract wins support oceaneerings view that demand for its products and services is starting to improve that said oceaneering doesnt expect those new agreements to help it this year instead larson noted that the companys outlook for the year has not changed with it continuing to project that it will be marginally profitable in   matt dilallo has no position in any stocks

into the black while the offshore service and product company still expects to remain marginally profitable this year it sees better days ahead matthew dilallo tmfmd jul   at am oceaneering internationals nyseoii financial results bounced back in the second quarter after the company reported a meager profit and ended a string of losses while the company expects further improvement in the back half of the year it still doesnt expect to report more than a marginal profit for the full year because of the continued pressure on the offshore drilling sector oceaneering results the raw numbers metric q  q  yearoveryear change revenue  million  million  adjusted net income  million  million nm adjusted eps   nm data source oceaneering international image source getty images what happened with oceaneering this quarter  oceaneerings results bounced back off the bottom revenue from the companys remotely operated vehicles rov segment was up  from the first quarter to  million though it was down  year over year driving the sequential improvement was higher utilization due in part to retiring four rovs during the quarter while only putting one new rov into service that rise in revenue along with a slight improvement in margin drove operating income up  versus last quarter though its still down more than  from last years second quarter subsea products revenue rose  from last quarter to  million though its still down  from the yearago quarter furthermore despite the sequential improvement in revenue operating income still fell due to the continued weakness and competitive nature of the service and rental market the subsea projects segment was one of the brighter spots delivering a  increase in revenue to  million because of seasonal improvements in the gulf of mexico that helped fuel an eyecatching  surge in operating income though thats off a meager base last quarter asset integritys sales were up  to  million primarily due to seasonality which also drove an increase in operating income finally the advanced technology segment delivered a  increase in revenue which came in at  million for the quarter because of increased commercial activity and work for the us navy that sparked a more than  improvement in operating income what management had to say  recently installed ceo rod larson commented on the companys secondquarter results noting that  our overall operating results during the quarter were in line with expectations we were pleased that each of our operating segments remained profitable on a consolidated basis for the first half of  we have generated  million of ebitda and  million of free cash flow we believe our cash flow and liquidity position us well to manage our business through the continuing industry downturn at the end of the quarter we had  million in cash and an undrawn  million revolving credit facility based on these strengths the board maintained our current dividend rate and declared a  per share dividend to be paid during the third quarter of  as larson noted the company continues to navigate through the challenging market environment by keeping its costs down so it can generate cash and strengthen its financial position this improving liquidity gives it the flexibility to pursue opportunities that may emerge to grow our company according to larson in particular he noted that oceaneering is focusing its attention on capturing more of the operating expenditures of its customers in the production phase as opposed to its current focus on exploration drilling that should provide the company with a more stable revenue stream if its successful in securing those opportunities looking forward  oceaneering announced that it was successful in securing several longerterm contracts during the quarter it won a threeyear contract with norways statoil nysesto to develop and implement an inspection and maintenance program at  of its facilities furthermore statoil can expand that agreement to other fields in the future meanwhile royal dutch shell nyserdsa nyserdsb awarded the company a products and services contract relating to its appomattox development in the gulf shell expects to start the project later this year and should complete it sometime in  these contract wins support oceaneerings view that demand for its products and services is starting to improve that said oceaneering doesnt expect those new agreements to help it this year instead larson noted that the companys outlook for the year has not changed with it continuing to project that it will be marginally profitable
