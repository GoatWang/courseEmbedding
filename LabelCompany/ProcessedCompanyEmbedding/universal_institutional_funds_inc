existing shareholders the portfolio may recommence offering its shares to new investors at such time as the portfolios adviser morgan stanley investment management inc the adviser determines that it would be consistent with prudent portfolio management to do so   objective the portfolio seeks longterm capital appreciation by investing primarily in growthoriented equity securities of small companies   approach the adviser seeks longterm capital appreciation by investing primarily in growthoriented equity securities of small us and foreign companies including emerging market securities the adviser selects issues from a universe comprised of small cap companies most with market capitalizations of generally less than  billion   the adviser may invest up to  of the portfolios net assets in foreign securities including emerging market securities classified as american depositary receipts adrs global depositary receipts gdrs american depositary shares adss or global depositary shares gdss foreign us dollardenominated securities that are traded on a us exchange or local shares of emerging market or developing countries   process the adviser seeks to invest in high quality companies it believes have sustainable competitive advantages and the ability to redeploy capital at high rates of return the adviser typically favors companies with rising returns on invested capital above average business visibility strong free cash flow generation and an attractive riskreward profile the adviser generally considers selling an investment when it determines the company no longer satisfies its investment criteria   the portfolio may invest up to  of its net assets in real estate investment trusts reits   under normal circumstances at least  of the assets of the portfolio will be invested in equity securities of small companies this policy may be changed without shareholder approval however you would be notified in writing of any changes derivative instruments used by the portfolio will be counted toward the  policy discussed above to the extent they have economic characteristics similar to the securities included within that policy   a company is considered to be a small cap company if it has a total market capitalization at the time of purchase of  billion or less the market capitalization limit is subject to adjustment annually based upon the advisers assessment as to the capitalization range of companies which possess the fundamental characteristics of small cap companies   risks an investment in the portfolio is subject to risks and you could lose money on your investment in the portfolio there can be no assurance that the portfolio will achieve its investment objective   investing in the portfolio may be appropriate for you if you are willing to accept the risks and uncertainties of investing in the equity securities of growthoriented small companies in general prices of equity securities are more volatile than those of fixed income securities the prices of equity securities will rise and fall in response to a number of different factors in particular equity securities will respond to events that affect entire financial markets or industries changes in inflation or consumer demand for example and to events that affect particular issuers news about the success or failure of a new product for example in addition at times growthoriented equity securities of small companies may underperform relative to the overall market   the risk of investing in equity securities is intensified in the case of the small companies in which the portfolio will invest market prices for such companies equity securities tend to be more volatile than those of larger more established companies such companies may themselves be more vulnerable to economic or company specific problems because of high valuations placed on companies with growth prospects within certain sectors such as technology biotechnology and internet the portfolio may own securities of companies that have significant market capitalizations despite a general lack of operating history andor positive earnings   uif small company growth portfolio    small company growth portfolio contd   investing in the securities of foreign issuers particularly those located in emerging market or developing countries entails the risk that news and events unique to a country or region will affect those markets and their issuers these same events will not necessarily have an effect on the us economy or similar issuers located in the united states   the portfolios investments may be denominated in foreign currencies as a result changes in the value of a countrys currency compared to the us dollar may affect the value of the portfolios investments these changes may occur separately from and in response to events that do not otherwise affect the value of the security in the issuers home country   reits pool investors funds for investments primarily in real estate properties or real estate related loans like mutual funds reits have expenses including advisory and administration fees that are paid by their shareholders as a result shareholders will absorb duplicate levels of fees when the portfolio invests in reits the performance of any portfolio reit holdings ultimately depends on the types of real property in which the reits invest and how well the property is managed a general downturn in real estate values also can hurt reit performance in addition reits are subject to certain provisions under federal tax law the failure of a company to qualify as a reit could have adverse consequences for the portfolio including significantly reducing the return to the portfolio on its investment in such company   the adviser may invest in certain instruments such as derivatives and may use certain techniques such as hedging to manage these risks however the adviser cannot guarantee that it will be practical to hedge these risks in certain markets or under particular conditions or that it will succeed in doing so the adviser may use derivatives for other purposes such as gaining exposure to foreign markets

portfolios investment practices and limitations are described in more detail in the statement of additional information sai which is incorporated by reference and legally is a part of this prospectus for details on how to obtain a copy of the sai and other reports and information see the back cover of this prospectus     price volatility the value of your investment in the portfolio is based on the market prices of the securities the portfolio holds these prices change daily due to economic and other events that affect markets generally as well as those that affect particular regions countries industries companies or governments these price movements sometimes called volatility may be greater or less depending on the types of securities the portfolio owns and the markets in which the securities trade over time equity securities have generally shown gains superior to fixed income securities although they have tended to be more volatile in the short term as a result of price volatility there is a risk that you may lose money by investing in the portfolio   equity securities equity securities include common stock preferred stock convertible securities depositary receipts rights and warrants the portfolio may invest in equity securities that are publicly traded on securities exchanges or over the counter or in equity securities that are not publicly traded securities that are not publicly traded may be more difficult to sell and their value may fluctuate more dramatically than other securities the prices of convertible securities are affected by changes similar to those of equity and fixed income securities the value of a convertible security tends to decline as interest rates rise and because of the conversion feature tends to vary with fluctuations in the market value of the underlying equity security   foreign securities foreign issuers generally are subject to different accounting auditing and financial reporting standards than us issuers there may be less information available to the public about foreign issuers securities of foreign issuers can be less liquid and experience greater price movements in some foreign countries there is also the risk of government expropriation excessive taxation political or social instability the imposition of currency controls or diplomatic developments that could affect the portfolios investment there also can be difficulty obtaining and enforcing judgments against issuers in foreign countries foreign stock exchanges brokerdealers and listed issuers may be subject to less government regulation and oversight the cost of investing in foreign securities including brokerage commissions and custodial expenses can be higher than in the united states   emerging market risks the portfolio may invest in emerging market or developing countries which are countries that major international financial institutions such as the world bank generally consider to be less economically mature than developed nations such as the united states or most nations in western europe emerging market or developing countries can include every nation in the world except the united states canada japan australia new zealand and most countries located in western europe these countries may be more likely to experience political turmoil or rapid changes in economic conditions than more developed countries and the financial condition of issuers in emerging market or developing countries may be more precatious than in other countries in addition emerging market securities generally are less liquid and subject to wider price and currency fluctuations than securities issued in more developed countries in addition emerging market securities generally are less liquid and subject to wider price and currency fluctuations than securities issued in more developed countries these characteristics result in greater risk of price volatility in emerging market or developing countries which may be heightened by currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar   foreign currency the portfolios investments may be denominated in foreign currencies the value of foreign currencies may fluctuate relative to the value of the us dollar since the portfolio may invest in such non us dollardenominated securities and therefore may convert the value of foreign securities into us dollars changes in currency exchange rates can increase or decrease the us dollar value of the portfolios assets the adviser may use derivatives to reduce this risk the adviser may in its discretion choose not to hedge against currency risk in addition certain market conditions may make it impossible or uneconomical to hedge against currency risk   derivatives and other investments the portfolio may use various instruments that derive their values from those of specified securities indices currencies or other points of reference for both hedging and nonhedging purposes derivatives include forward contracts futures options swaps and structured investments these derivatives including those used to manage risk are themselves subject to risks of the different markets in which they trade and therefore may not serve their intended purposes      uif small company growth portfolio class ii prospectus   investment summary     additional risk factors and information contd   a forward contract is an obligation to purchase or sell a security or a specific currency at a future date which may be any fixed number of days from the date of the contract agreed upon by the parties at a price set at the time of the contract forward foreign currency exchange contracts may be used to protect against uncertainty in the level of future foreign currency exchange rates or to gain or modify exposure to a particular currency   a futures contract provides for the future sale by one party and purchase by another party of a specified amount of a specific security at a specified future time and at a specified price the portfolio may use futures contracts to gain exposure to an entire market eg stock index futures or to control their exposure to changing foreign currency exchange rates   if the portfolio buys an option it buys a legal contract giving it the right to buy or sell a specific amount of a security or futures contract at an agreedupon price if the portfolio writes an option it sells to another person the right to buy from or sell to the portfolio a specific amount of a security or futures contract at an agreedupon price   the portfolio may enter into swap transactions which are contracts in which the portfolio agrees to exchange the return or interest rate on one instrument for the return or interest rate on another instrument payments may be based on currencies interest rates securities indices or commodity indices swaps may be used to manage the maturity and duration of a fixed income portfolio or to gain exposure to a market without directly investing in securities traded in that market   structured investments generally are interests in entities organized and operated for the purpose of restructuring the investment characteristics of underlying investment interests or securities   risks of derivatives the primary risks of derivatives are i changes in the market value of securities held by the portfolio and of derivatives relating to those securities may not be proportionate ii there may not be a liquid market for the portfolio to sell a derivative which could result in difficulty closing a position and iii certain derivatives can magnify the extent of losses incurred due to changes in the market value of the securities to which they relate in addition some derivatives are subject to counterparty risk to minimize this risk the portfolio may enter into derivatives transactions only with counterparties that meet certain requirements for credit quality and collateral also the portfolio may invest in certain derivatives that require the portfolio to segregate some or all of its cash or liquid securities to cover its obligations under those instruments at certain levels this can cause the portfolio to lose flexibility in managing its investments properly responding to shareholder redemption requests or meeting other obligations if the portfolio is in that position it could be forced to sell other securities that it wanted to retain   hedging the portfolios currency risks involves the risk of mismatching the portfolios obligations under a forward or futures contract with the value of securities denominated in a particular currency   investments in structured investments involve risks including interest rate risk credit risk market risk and other associated risks   while the use of derivatives may be advantageous to the portfolio if the adviser is not successful in employing them the portfolios performance may be worse than if it did not make such investments see the sai for more information about the risks of different types of derivatives   temporary defensive investments when the adviser believes that changes in economic financial or political conditions warrant the portfolio may invest without limit in certain short and mediumterm fixed income securities that may be inconsistent with its principal investment strategies for temporary defensive purposes if the adviser incorrectly predicts the effects of these changes such defensive investments may adversely affect the portfolios performance and the portfolio may not achieve its investment objective   portfolio turnover consistent with its investment policies the portfolio will purchase and sell securities without regard to the effect on portfolio turnover higher portfolio turnover eg over  per year will cause the portfolio to incur additional transaction costs the portfolio may engage in frequent trading of securities to achieve its investment objective   uif small company growth portfolio    fund

voluntarily agreed to reduce its advisory fee andor reimburse the portfolio so that total annual operating expenses of the portfolio will not exceed  of its average daily net assets for purposes of determining the amount of the voluntary advisory fee waiver andor reimbursement if any the annual operating expenses of the portfolio exclude certain investment related expenses such as foreign

in connection with the distribution of class ii shares of the portfolio the distributor has voluntarily agreed to waive  of the  b fee that it may receive this waiver is voluntary and the distributor reserves the right to terminate the waiver at any time and without notice   since the b fees associated with the plan are paid out of the portfolios assets on an ongoing basis over time these fees will increase the cost of your investment and may cost you more than paying other types of sales charges   the adviser andor the distributor may pay additional compensation out of their own funds and not as an expense of the portfolio to certain affiliated or unaffiliated brokers dealers andor certain insurance companies or other financial intermediaries or service providers in connection with the sale distribution marketing andor retention of shares of the portfolio andor shareholder servicing such compensation may be significant in amount and the prospect of receiving any such additional compensation may provide such affiliated or unaffiliated entities with an incentive to favor sales of the portfolios shares over other investment options any such payments will not change the net asset value or the price of the portfolios shares for more information please see the funds sai   uif small company growth portfolio    shareholder information   share class this prospectus offers class ii shares of the small company growth portfolio the fund does not currently offer class i shares but may do so in the future class ii shares are subject to higher expenses due to the imposition of a b fee for additional information about availability of class i shares of the portfolio contact your insurance company or qualified pension or retirement plan   purchasing and selling fund shares shares are offered on each day that the new york stock exchange the nyse is open for business   the portfolio offers its shares only to insurance companies for separate accounts that they establish to fund variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts and to other entities under qualified pension and retirement plans an insurance company purchases or redeems shares of the portfolio based on among other things the amount of net contract premiums or purchase payments allocated to a separate account investment division transfers to or from a separate account investment division contract loans and repayments contract withdrawals and surrenders and benefit payments the contract prospectus describes how contract owners may allocate transfer and withdraw amounts to and from separate accounts   there are no known disadvantages to variable product contract owners or qualified plan participants arising out of the fact that the portfolio offers its shares to separate accounts of various insurance companies that offer variable annuity and variable life insurance products and various other entities under qualified pension and retirement plans nevertheless the board of directors that oversees the portfolio intends to monitor events to identify any material irreconcilable conflicts that may possibly arise due to these arrangements and to determine what action if any should be taken in response   pricing of portfolio shares the price per share will be the net asset value nav per share next determined after the fund or the insurance company receives your purchase or redemption order the nav for one share is the value of that shares portion of all of the net assets in the portfolio the fund determines the nav per share for the portfolio as of the close of the nyse normally  pm eastern time on each day that the portfolio is open for business   about net asset value the nav per share of the portfolio is determined by dividing the total of the value of the portfolios investments and other assets less any liabilities by the total number of outstanding shares of the portfolio in making this calculation the portfolio generally values securities at market price if market prices are unavailable or may be unreliable because of events occurring after the close of trading the value for those securities will be determined in good faith at fair value using methods approved by the board of directors in addition with respect to securities that primarily are listed on foreign exchanges when an event occurs after the close of such exchanges that is likely to have changed the value of the securities for example a percentage change in value of one or more us securities indices in excess of specified thresholds such securities will be valued at their fair value as determined under procedures established by the funds board of directors securities also may be fair valued in the event of a significant development affecting a country or region or an issuerspecific development which is likely to have changed the value of the security in these cases the portfolios nav will reflect certain portfolio securities fair value rather than their market price to the extent the portfolio invests in openend management companies that are registered under the investment company act of  as amended investment company act the portfolios nav is calculated based upon the nav of such funds the prospectuses for such funds explain the circumstances under which they will use fair value pricing and its effects   fair value pricing involves subjective judgments and it is possible that the fair value determined for a security is materially different than the value that could be realized upon the sale of that security the portfolio may hold portfolio securities that are listed on foreign exchanges these securities may trade on weekends or other days when the portfolio does not calculate its nav as a result the value of these investments may change on days when you cannot purchase or sell shares   the nav of class ii shares will differ from that of other classes because of classspecific expenses that each class may pay      uif small company growth portfolio class ii prospectus   shareholder information     shareholder information contd   dividends and distributions the portfolio distributes its net investment income if any at least annually as dividends and makes distributions of its net realized capital gains if any at least annually   taxes the portfolio expects that it will not have to pay federal income taxes if it distributes annually all of its net investment income and net realized capital gains the portfolio does not expect to be subject to federal excise taxes with respect to undistributed income   special tax rules apply to life insurance companies variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance contracts for information on federal income taxation of a life insurance company with respect to its receipt of distributions from the portfolio and federal income taxation of owners of variable annuity or variable life insurance contracts refer to the contract prospectus   because each investors tax circumstances are unique and the tax laws may change you should consult your tax advisor about the federal state and local tax consequences applicable to your investment   frequent purchases and redemptions of shares frequent purchases and redemptions of shares pursuant to the instructions of insurance company contract owners or qualified plan participants are referred to as markettiming or shortterm trading and may present risks for other contract owners or participants with longterm interests in the portfolio which may include among other things dilution in the value of the portfolios shares indirectly held by contract owners or participants with longterm interests in the portfolio interference with the efficient management of the portfolio increased brokerage and administrative costs and forcing the portfolio to hold excess levels of cash   in addition the portfolio is subject to the risk that markettimers andor shortterm traders may take advantage of time zone differences between the foreign markets on which the portfolios securities trade and the time as of which the portfolios nav is calculated timezone arbitrage for example a markettimer may submit instructions for the purchase of shares of the portfolio based on events occurring after foreign market closing prices are established but before the portfolios nav calculation that are likely to result in higher prices in foreign markets the following day the markettimer would submit instructions to redeem the portfolios shares the next day when the portfolios share price would reflect the increased prices in foreign markets for a quick profit at the expense of contract owners or participants with longterm interests in the portfolio   investments in other types of securities also may be susceptible to shortterm trading strategies these investments include securities that are among other things thinly traded traded infrequently or relatively illiquid which have the risk that the current market price for the securities may not accurately reflect current market values a contract owner may seek to engage in shortterm trading to take advantage of these pricing differences referred to as pricearbitrage the portfolios policies with respect to valuing portfolio securities are described in about net asset value   the funds board of directors has adopted policies and procedures to discourage frequent purchases and redemptions of portfolio shares by portfolio shareholders insurance companies or qualified plans generally do not provide specific contract owner or plan participant transaction instructions to the portfolio on an ongoing basis therefore to some extent the portfolio relies on the insurance companies and qualified plans to monitor frequent shortterm trading by contract owners however the portfolio has entered into agreements with insurance companies and qualified plans whereby the insurance companies and qualified plans are required to provide certain contract owner identification and transaction information upon the portfolios request the portfolio may use this information to help identify and prevent markettiming activity in the portfolio there can be no assurance that the portfolio will be able to identify or prevent all markettiming activity   if the portfolio identifies suspected markettiming activity the insurance company or qualified plan will be contacted and asked to take steps to prevent further markettiming activity eg sending warning letters or blocking frequent trading by underlying contract owners or participants insurance companies may be prohibited by the terms of the underlying insurance contract from restricting shortterm trading of mutual fund shares by contract owners thereby limiting the ability of such insurance company to implement remedial steps to prevent markettiming activity in the portfolio if the insurance company or   uif small company growth portfolio    shareholder information contd   qualified plan is unwilling or unable to take remedial steps to discourage or prevent frequent trading or does not take action promptly certain contract owners or participants may be able to engage in frequent trading to the detriment of contract owners or participants with longterm interests in the portfolio if the insurance company or qualified plan refuses to take remedial action or takes action that the portfolio deems insufficient a determination will be made whether it is appropriate to terminate the relationship with such insurance company or qualified plan   portfolio holdings information a description of the funds policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of the portfolios securities is available in the funds sai
