provides financing to gold mining companies through gold stream and royalty agreements stream and royalty finance involves sandstorm making an upfront payment to a mining partner that is in need of capital to build their mine refinance their obligations complete an acquisition or for various other reasons in exchange for that upfront payment sandstorm receives the right to purchase a percentage of the gold produced from the mine in the case of a stream or a portion of the revenue generated from the mine in the case of a royalty since  sandstorm has compiled a portfolio of  streams and royalties of which  of the underlying assets are currently producing gold sandstorm plans to continue growing the company through accretive acquisitions of gold streams and royalties   a lower risk mining investment   building and operating gold mines is difficult work gold mines in the best of situations have countless operational processes to coordinate and perform in synchronization in order to function economically capital expenditure overruns sustaining capital requirements and inflating costs are just a few of the challenges that mining companies face when trying to deliver returns to shareholders the stream and royalty business model minimizes the typical downside risks in mining investment because there is no obligation for sandstorm to contribute additional capital after the upfront payment is made sandstorm leaves the job of building and operating the gold mines to its partners while using its expertise to supply them with financial support this allows sandstorm to focus on accretive growth while creating an attractive gold investment for the public a sandstorm investment maximizes upside potential while minimizing downside risks   watch our corporate video    watch our due diligence video        corporate due diligence   before completing a gold stream or royalty agreement with a mining partner sandstorm undertakes a thorough due diligence process the process begins with a desktop analysis that evaluates the economics of the mine assuming that all aspects of the project will work out as planned most projects fail this stage the ones that pass are scrutinized from a technical point of view and management runs sensitivity analysis to search for potential fatal flaw areas after that step sandstorm hires geological consultants and technical experts that specialize in the deposit type location and jurisdiction of the project in question those projects that make it this far in the corporate due diligence process are subject to a comprehensive site visit which assesses metallurgical engineering and geologic resource issues     corporate head office suite   burrard street vancouver bc  vc a canada p  t  f  infosandstormltdcom

responsibility video    corporate responsibility sandstorm gold ltd sandstorm gold ltd “sandstorm gold” “sandstorm” or the “company” is in the business of providing financing solutions to companies in the mining sector principally through stream and royalty transactions enabling resource companies to further the exploration development and operations at a mining property the properties over which the company holds stream and royalty interests are owned and operated by independent mining companies and sandstorm does not exercise control or influence over the activities of the property owners however sandstorm is committed to furthering the responsible development of mineral projects and the sustainable extraction of metals through its financial investments including with respect to environmental factors eg toxic emissions and waste carbon emissions biodiversity and land use water stress social considerations eg occupational health and safety labour management and governance issues eg corruption and instability corporate governance collectively “esg” esg – indirect exposure the stream  royalty business model sandstorm gold provides an alternative source of capital to the mining industry in the form of stream and royalty financing arrangements in exchange for upfront capital sandstorm receives a portion of the future metal or revenue generated from a mining operation but being a financier the company does not directly own or operate the projects and has indirect exposure to esg issues that can arise during the life cycle of a resource project sandstorm’s indirect exposure to esg risk factors are mitigated in part by the company’s diversified portfolio of over  streams and royalties over  of which are generating cash flow to the company there is no evidence of a statistical relationship or positive correlation between the esg successes and challenges at the various mining projects within the company’s portfolio of streams and royalties indicating a clear diversification benefit to sandstorm’s portfolio approach sandstorm is committed to furthering sustainable development in the mining and metals industry through its investments and seeks to address esg risks through the company’s due diligence process that guides its investment decisions investment due diligence while sandstorm does not control or influence the operations of any of the properties over which it has a stream or royalty interest the company recognizes that its financial investments may contribute to esg factors the company’s strategy to mitigate esg risks involves a thorough investigation and evaluation of the risk factors related to a mineral property prior to making an investment once a sandstorm investment is made the company has no control over the project or the various esg risks that can be associated with a mine it is therefore the aim of sandstorm’s due diligence process to successfully identify projects and companies that will act and operate in a responsible and sustainable manner sandstorm’s management team and board of directors use a multidisciplinary approach when evaluating potential transactions the due diligence team consists of professionals with experience and expertise in the fields of geology mining metallurgy engineering and finance by conducting a robust and detailed due diligence process sandstorm endeavours to invest in projects with relatively low esg risk the due diligence process involves among other things thorough desktop studies the engagement of expert consultants extensive interviews with the project management team site visits as well as in depth deliberation elements of sandstorm’s due diligence process related to esg factors include but are not limited to the following considerations
