with little to no learning curve whether you are new to using pax or have tried it before read on for pro tips from our knowledgeable tech and support team vapor feels different for everyone so the most important tip we can give you is experiment to find what works for you setting the temperature  most paxers like to start on the low or medium temperature setting and work their way up to the highest temperature before finishing filling the oven  if not already shredded grind your material into small pieces a moderate grind is perfect because pax utilizes conduction heating you’ll want to pack your oven contents firmly to increase the surface area of your material tamp the contents down until your oven is halfway full at minimum you can fill the oven all the way too just make sure none of your material is above the edge of the oven tamp down again before replacing your oven lid turning on pax  turn your pax on by pushing down on the mouthpiece and gently releasing your thumb the mouthpiece is spring loaded so if you push down hard and release quickly your mouthpiece will pop up drawing on pax  while pax is pulsing purple indicating it’s heating up you should know the following pax does the work for you and creates vapor in the oven through direct contact gently heating your material drawing a lot of air through the device won’t create more vapor you will just be inhaling hot air instead allow the vapor to form in the oven to produce bigger clouds a firm but gentle  second draw should be enough to clear the oven of vapor remember to give pax a few seconds in between your next draw to heat your material again and create more vapor in the oven when you start to taste less and see less vapor adjust the temperature setting to high to make the most of your oven contents you can tell the ovenload is finished if no more vapor is being produced “sip it don’t rip it” screen placement  the paxs screen plays a critical role in the quality of your vapor if you notice a change in the quality of your vapor your screen is probably due for a cleaning you’ll also want to make sure the oven screen is inserted properly turning pax off  lightly push down about halfway until you feel the mouthpiece click into place release your finger gently the mouthpiece sits on top of a spring and as you push down about halfway a clasp grabs the metal ring that sits just under the plastic mouthpiece there’s a good chance on your first try you’ll push down too far and miss the clasp causing the spring to bottom out and pop up the mouthpiece after you’ve become familiar with the motion you’ll be able to close the mouthpiece quickly and easily keep up with pax innovations insider news and promotions subscribe as seen in pax labs about careers press press kit blog

company pax labs has closed a funding round from heavyweight investors and released a new product aimed at crushing competitors in the ecigarette space by will yakowicz will yakowicz is an awardwinning journalist and a staff writer and podcaster for inc magazinebefore inc he reported from the west bank and moscow for tablet magazine he covered business crime and local politics for the brooklyn paper and he was the editor of park slope patch he lives in brooklyn new york willyakowicz staff writer incwillyakowicz  comments credit pax labs a san franciscobased vaporizer company announced a whopping  million series c round on wednesday led by investors including fidelity management  research company and sivia capital fidelity declined to comment about its investment but paxs success as wooing such an established institutional investor is a clear sign that vaping has become a serious growth business according to a new reutersipsos poll about  percent of us adults now use electronic cigarettes and or other vaporizing devices four times the estimated number in  wells fargo securities analyst bonnie herzog estimates the us vaporizer market will grow to  billion by the end of the year up from  billion in  pax labs used to be named ploom but sold the ploom name and its modeltwo vaporizer to japanese tobacco international earlier this year after a threeyear partnership founded in  by stanford graduate design students james monsees now the ceo and adam bowen now cto pax has seen sales grow  percent over the past two years and has sold more than  units of its eponymous flagship product a portable loose leaf vaporizer that looks more like a mobile electronic device than a vapor delivery system monsees and bowen says pax will use the new funding to expand beyond the us and canada racing to replace the cigarette on june  pax labs released its newest product the juul a sleek electronic cigarette the company sells along with its liquid nicotine cartridges inside the sd cardsized cartridgeswhich are available at  retail locations around the us as well as by monthly subscription on paxs websiteis a proprietary blend of nicotine liquid that pax labs chemists reverseengineered from the tobacco plant compared to competitors nicotine liquids bowen says paxs has a bigger punch that is more satisfying to people who are switching over from cigarettes the juul pax labs ecigarette launched june  with four flavors of nicotine liquidtabaac miint fruut and bruule credit courtesy company its  times as much nicotine as other ecigarettes on the market which sounds crazy high but its actually what you get per puff from a cigarette bowen says other ecigarettes cant go that high monsees and bowen say that the ecigarette industrys biggest problem is that most smokers arent satiated by ecigs and go back to conventional cigarettes additionally as the reutersipsos poll found about  percent of people who vape nicotine continue to smoke cigarettes the founders hope that because the juuls liquid delivers similar nicotine satisfaction to that of a cigarette the product will get people to give up smoking most researchers believe ecigs will prove to be less harmful than cigarettes and various studies have found no evidence that vaporizing liquid nicotine causes cancer or heart disease still the longterm health effects of vaping remain unclear a future in cannabis pax labs has never marketed its products to marijuana users but thanks to their portability and how well they vaporize thc from cannabis flowers the pax loose leaf vaporizer and the recently released pax have been heartily adopted by legions of marijuana users the cult following the pax has created has blossomed into a community of technologyminded cannabis users who congregate on a subsection of reddit the pax the next generation of pax labs loose leaf vaporizer is  percent smaller and  percent lighter than its predecessorcredit courtesy company the rising popularity of thc concentrates could be a huge opportunity for pax labs while the juul is a closed system the pax can be filled with whatever material the consumer wants to pack in it monsees and bowen who have somewhat accidentally become the godfathers of arguably the best portable highend and hightech pot vaporizer on the market know their products potential in the cannabis industry pax is currently a tobacco product but the industry and the regulatory landscape is shifting were very much aware of that and we would love for this technology to applied as broadly as possible monsees says that was the concept from day one we did not want to build a tobacco company it was to build the greatest vaporization company possible but when asked if they have a thc oil cartridge waiting to be deployed in colorado or other markets where recreational marijuana is legal the vape kings say not yet we are experimenting with the technologies for other markets potentially for the cannabis market but we will only ever do that in places where we can get full legal compliance for federal state and local level monsees says we do not have a product announcement at this point but certainly the future is bright to bring technologies that open up the landscape published on jun   weed vaporizers  shop  compare tool patient education patient education patient education homepage getting
