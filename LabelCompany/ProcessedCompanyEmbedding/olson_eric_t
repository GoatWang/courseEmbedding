philosophy of mind the first general study of the important question of what is the basic maetphysical nature of human people what are we a study in personal ontology eric t olson philosophy of mind description from the time of locke discussions of personal identity have often ignored the question of our basic metaphysical nature whether we human people are biological organisms spatial or temporal parts of organisms bundles of perceptions or what have you the result of this neglect has been centuries of wild proposals and clashing intuitionswhat are we is the first general study of this important question it beings by explaining what the question means and how it differs from others such as questions of personal identity and the mindbody problem it then examines in some depth the main possible accounts of our metaphysical nature detailing both their theoretical virtues and the often grave difficulties they facethe book does not endorse any particular account of what we are but argues that the matter turns on more general issues in the ontology of material things if composition is universalif any material things whatever make up something biggerthen we are temporal parts of organisms if things never compose anything bigger so that there are only mereological simples then we too are simplesperhaps the immaterial substances of descartesor else we do not exist at all a view olson takes very seriously the intermediate view that some things compose bigger things and others do not leads almost inevitably to the conclusion that we are organisms so we can discover what we are by working out when composition occurs show more what are we a study in personal ontology eric t olson philosophy of mind table of contents  the question animals constitution brains temporal parts bundles souls nihilism what now what are we a study in personal ontology eric t olson philosophy of mind author information eric t olson is professor of philosophy at the university of sheffield what are we a study in personal ontology eric t olson philosophy of mind reviews and awards olson presents all the serious options on personal ontology together with the best reasons for and against them and he shows that each of these options has implications for a wide variety of philosophical topicsnot just personal identity over timeand also that those topics have implications for each of these options what are we is clear enough to be of use to the philosophical novice but sophisticated enough and fair enough to withstand the scrutiny of professional philosophers for anyone who wants to understand the question what are weand who wants to see how to begin to answer that question in a principled waythere is to better guide than olsons booktrenton merricks times literary supplement this is a good book its philosophical sophistication and rigor should recommend it to anyone working on the metaphysics of persons and its scope and readability should recommend it to anyone teaching metaphysics to upper level undergraduates or graduate students whether or not this is a question with an answer accompanying olson on his trip through the logical space it carves out is enjoyable and rewardingmichael orourke notre dame philosophical reviews share also of interest the human animal eric t olson beyond reduction steven horst character and moral psychology christian b miller

the human animal personal identity without psychology eric t olson philosophy of mind the human animal personal identity without psychology eric t olson philosophy of mind description most philosophers writing about personal identity in recent years claim that what it takes for us to persist through time is a matter of psychology in this groundbreaking new book eric olson argues that such approaches face daunting problems and he defends in their place a radically nonpsychological account of personal identity he defines human beings as biological organisms and claims that no psychological relation is either sufficient or necessary for an organism to persist rejecting several famous thought experiments dealing with personal identity he instead argues that one could survive the destruction of all of ones psychological contents and capabilities as long as the human organism remains alive show more the human animal personal identity without psychology eric t olson philosophy of mind author information eric olson is a lecturer in philosophy at cambridge university the human animal personal identity without psychology eric t olson philosophy of mind reviews and awards chosen as an outstanding academic book of  by choice a very clear and powerfully argued defence of a most important and surprisingly neglected viewderek parfit author of reasons and persons all souls college oxford for hundreds of years almost all philosophers writing on the topic have supposed that personal identity is either entirely a matter of psychology or at least has an important and essential psychological component this important book presents a powerful challenge to that assumption if dr olson is right we are living animals and what goes on in our minds is wholly irrelevant to questions about our persistence through time if this book receives the attention it deserves it will transform philosophical thinking about personal identitypeter van inwagen author of an essay on free will material beings and metaphysics university of notre dame olsons excellent and enjoyable book should be read by everyone with an interest in metaphysics for those seriously interested in the

in  business days when will my order arrive add to basket add to wishlist description from the time of locke discussions of personal identity have often ignored the question of our basic metaphysical nature whether we human people are biological organisms spatial or temporal parts of organisms bundles of perceptions or what have you the result of this neglect has been centuries of wild proposals and clashing intuitions what are we is the first general study of this important question it beings by explaining what the question means and how it differs from others such as questions of personal identity and the mindbody problem it then examines in some depth the main possible accounts of our metaphysical nature detailing both their theoretical virtues and the often grave difficulties they face the book does not endorse any particular account of what we are but argues that the matter turns on more general issues in the ontology of material things if composition is universalif any material things whatever make up something biggerthen we are temporal parts of organismsif things never compose anything bigger so that there are only mereological simples then we too are simplesperhaps the immaterial substances of descartesor else we do not exist at all a view olson takes very seriously the intermediate view that some things compose bigger things and others do not leads almost inevitably to the conclusion that we are organisms so we can discover what we are by working out when composition occursshow more product details format hardback   pages dimensions  x  x
