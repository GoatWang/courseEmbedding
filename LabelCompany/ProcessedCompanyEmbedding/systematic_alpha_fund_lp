therein further pools and accounts may be subject to substantial charges for management and advisory and brokerage fees it may be necessary for those pools and accounts that are subject to these charges to make substantial trading profits to avoid depletion or exhaustion of their assets in addition restrictions on redemptions may affect your ability to withdraw your participation in a pool
