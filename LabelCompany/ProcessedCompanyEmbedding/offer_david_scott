a woman with a will whose strength has been matched by few souls in history mother teresa broke death’s stranglehold on the poor of calcutta and she showed us how to conquer the sin and darkness in what she called the “slums of the hearts of modern man”part biography and part spiritual reading these pages bring to light littleknown stories from mother teresa’s life that will help you to grow in your love of god you will learn her approach to reading scripture what enabled her to persevere through agonizing nights and the remarkable  some would say mystical  events that led her to start the missionaries of charityin considering mother teresa her private visions and her secret sufferings david scott has discovered scores of early episodes and chance encounters that point to later larger meanings these remarkable patterns he suggests show that mother teresa’s life was choreographed from above as if a divine script had been written for her from before her birth product information▼▲
