sports group is on the rise  performance sports group ltd nysepsg  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»why performance sports group is on the riseapr  about performance sports psg peter ostrowski long only growth research analyst momentumsummarymacroeconomic issuessports authoritys chapter  bankruptcystrong product basebig investors keeping stake in companyperformance sports group nysepsg is a leading manufacturer of many different sports products the main product brands that bring value to this company are bauer hockey and easton brands at the end of the fiscal year  hockey represented  million in sales or  of total revenue while baseball represented  million or  of total revenue according to the  annual report psg stated that easton is the leader in diamond sports with  of the market share bauer sports also has the number one market share in hockey as shown below this is directly from the k which lists bauer to have an estimated  of the market share of a roughly  million industry this is to show the strong brands that are currently supporting this struggling company macroeconomic effects this past year psg ran into multiple headwinds they all affected revenue growth but it is important to note which issues were simply out of control and part of the business the forex issues were related to the weakening of the canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar over the past year there were also issues in the overall demand for hockey products over the past year this tends to be a cyclical business that is up and down as years progress sports authority psg is a huge supplier to sports authority as a result of sports authoritys recent chapter  bankruptcy sales have decreased and investor confidence significantly decreased sports authority is currently in the midst of closing  stores as they have recently began huge liquidation sales to try to pay off their billion dollars worth of debt the closings of these stores have impacted the price of psg significantly however i do not believe the entirety of the decrease in price is justified the rest of this article will discuss the upside potential of psg and why i believe it is currently at its trough key investors the price has been significantly increasing these past two days after wellington management group decided to keep a stake in psg the reported filing shows a  passive stake this shows that wellington is still bullish on psg as they are the second highest investor behind sagard capital the market seems to have forgotten the huge brands that psg currently owns these two investment companies have not the fact that they are still bullish shows a high opportunity for growth this also hints at a solid earnings report this friday which is causing market excitement acquisition potential sagard capital upped their stake in psg last month they currently own  of psg sagard capitals strategy is to take significant minority positions in small to midcap stocks then it will sponsor teams to help take struggling companies private as sagard capital has already appointed their ceo daniel friedberg to psgs board it seems that they have already taken initiative for their strategy sagard capital has a history of doing this as i will give a few recent examples sagard capital completed a deal in  where they personally purchased intramed america for share with a total purchase price of  million the price jumped from  when it was announced that sagard capital would be acquiring them even more important to note is the success xrite had when daniel friedman was appointed to the board of directors xrite was acquired by danaher corporation nysedhr for a  premium recent price increases with the earnings report coming up this friday large amounts of speculation are artificially increasing the price this is largely due to the d that was recently filed with wellington management group as previously stated when big investors show that they want to hold a large majority interest in a company over  other investors react to this in a bullish fashion i believe this company is still undervalued but be weary of the significant increases these investors most likely believe that there is going to be some sort of acquisition or positive analysis in the transcript financials it is important to look to past financials to show the profitability this company used to bring in comparison to its competitors below i have created a chart to show the underperformance of this company in the past year the past years profitability measures of psg are low because of the decreases in revenue which i have discussed earlier in psgs earnings report today they will most likely discuss future plans to increase revenues with the bankruptcy of sports authority the company is currently highly leveraged with  million of longterm debt there is no danger of bankruptcy as they have a working capital of  million that consists of  million in inventories the inventory turnover days have actually decreased over the past few years as shown below source bloomberg this shows that they are selling off their inventory at a faster rate than any other year they are then using this capital to pay off debt and invest back into the business valuation in order to estimate an acquisition target value i have used capitaliq for their quick comp transactions i have sorted through the comparables as necessary for this i have used evebitda and evebit below i have attached the list of transactions and their multiples using these general multiples and the average analysts estimated ebitda and ebit i am estimating that psg will be acquired for a price of around  million with  million shares outstanding this is a price of around  per share this represents a large upside potential for investors if psg is acquired the year forward evebitda which i have calculated using analyst future estimates from bloomberg shows an even higher upside potential as i have demonstrated below the enterprise value was calculated adding total debt to equity and subtracting cash conclusion in conclusion i would recommend a buy on psg i believe this stock is still very cheap and has strong products within their company when i valued this company using a dcf model i did find issues with their operating costs the analysts are currently estimating the next quarters to be around  and it will be difficult for psg to operate without lowering those costs to around  for the long run i am pricing this stock as an acquisition target because of the current minority holders of this stock

continued growth  performance sports group ltd nysepsg  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»performance sports groups headwinds and their continued growthnov  about performance sports psg michael ambrozewicz longshort equity growth research analyst longterm horizonsummaryincreasing intense competition from other competitors in the sporting goods industrythe lack of a youthful sales force as a foundation for future growthconcerns in administration and improving their balance sheetperformance sports group ltd psg formerly bauer performance sports is a publicly traded stock in the new york stock exchange it is a leading international hockey supplier and has recently incorporated lacrosse baseball and uniforms to expand its supply chain its a company that is deeply rooted in canadian psychic and eager to expand their investor base into the united states however its one of the few companies that i can say with certainty that will remain neutral in the  to  range theres a very disturbing trend that bauer hockey a branch under performance sports group incorporated with respect to how retailers market their products retailers in canada usa and europe are required to retail bauer products at the suggested retail price regardless of how dominant the retailer is in the market their conventional wisdom and by that i mean sales managers that were brought into the organization from the old cooper days have indicated that the purchasing consumer relies on a  mile radius to purchase hockey equipment competitors such as reebokccm warrior easton have suggested to retailers for their elite level products that a call for pricing is in effect in fact the reebokccm sales manager said that in times of slow business where you must move product the call for pricing allows retailers to move stock quicker and get a return on investment reebokccm had their biggest and most successful launch with reviving the tacks brand in fact retailers cant keep up with the demand performance sports group exacerbated their problem by not allowing retailers to move product in a timely fashion and to repeat with them with bauer products retailers will book and not repeat even if bauer has a new product launch retailers will have a reservation to book more than their required minimum in the long run they will maintain revenue but never exceed expectations how do i know this i worked parttime in a hockey store for five years supporting my education bauer hockey developed a certain moat by dominating the hockey market however this moat they developed is plagued with a tinge of arrogance which is counterproductive to revenue growth they have the best and the most innovative products in the world but this is not reflected by their sales force many times the bauer representative would come into the store tell a couple of jokes and leave without an order the reebokccm warrior and easton representatives represent a younger and more driven generation any time my former boss gave me an open to buy budget the younger reebokccm warrior and easton reps were much more eager to rake in revenue and promote their brand apples aapl success story is based on innovative products their sales force from top to bottom is based on youth which has become a key foundation in their growth story performance sports group lacks a young and energetic sales force that can religiously convey why retailers should deploy  of their shelf space to bauer products when i met the new reebokccm representative the first words that came out of his mouth were i want  of your shelf space what will it take increased revenue is based on the allocation of shelf space a companys moat relies on its ability to understand its competition the marketplace and the role the company plays to increase their revenue in the environment what they need to do is target other companies so that they do not gain a competitive advantage over them through acquisition performance sports group was able to generate revenue yearround a positive sign for investors but in order for performance sports group to think globally and execute their goals they need to emphasize the fact that by having innovative products they need the most innovative sales force this comes with youth instead of an old boys club living in the past investors invest in youth motivated management and innovation the reason why is because it provides them with confidence that a revenue stream is likely to continue hockey is one of the few sports that demand an enormous amount of commitment from parents costs involving hockey registration are up  since  gas prices also continue to rise making travel to and from hockey more expensive hockey equipment is not supplied by most organizations anymore escalating real estate prices have made building arenas infeasible and nonprofitable from an economic standpoint if arenas in canada and the usa are not being built then the revenue from hockey will slowly begin to deteriorate even the  growth that the us has experienced in hockey registration over the past year pales in comparison in the amount of kids who have not played hockey since the  recession it is one of the few sports heavily impacted by slowdowns in economic business cycles if there are expectations of interest rates rising in the us and canada then hockey parents will be the first to consider alternative sports to replace hockey house league registration is down across canada in both urban and rural areas the shift in demographics across north america has resulted in a smaller proportion of kids as the population continues to age mens recreational hockey leagues have also suffered as the awareness for injuries such as concussions have been shown to be more dangerous than previously thought the recreational leagues cater from men  years of age which have a high disposable income for the purchase of hockey equipment in general hockey suppliers are ignoring this huge market as the potential for growth continues to dwindle what performance sports group did successfully through acquisition was increasing their market share in hockey lacrosse and perhaps more importantly baseball the hockey equipment market is less fragmented than that of baseball you have two dominant suppliers and maybe one or two fringe suppliers that retailers rely upon in the business of hockey equipment in a stagnant hockey market that is good for bauer the only growth is by taking away market shares from competitors such as reebokccm the baseball market is crowded with large suppliers such as rawlings wilson mizuno etc who dominate in certain categories that help distinguish themselves from others however through the recent acquisition of easton bauer has taken over as the dominant supplier of baseball bats in lacrosse bauer dominates the business of head protection through their line of cascade helmets however warrior brine and stx still come out on top in terms of supplying teams with protective gear at over  million per year the team business stands out as a lucrative growth for businesses looking for additional revenue its interesting to note that performance sports group took a different approach with their business model they hired sales representatives to go directly to teams and allocate their business to a limited amount of retailers retailers who dont get the business push the competitors products instead by going directly to teams bauer is unable to charge more for teamwear and team uniforms the teamwear business is one of the few businesses that carry depreciating margins because teams expect low prices every year additionally if bauer is late to deliver their product they continually have to make amends in order to receive business for the following year thus reducing margins even further other competitors that traditionally use retailers as an intermediary have also gone directly to teams to compete with bauer since bauer went directly to teams for direct business whos responsible if the team decides to not pay the bill the retailer should not be liable for unpaid team business as a result of bauer choosing to handle all the work directly even though ccm has an nhl licensing agreement i can see them further strengthening their jersey line by purchasing companies like athletic knit that directly competes with inaria athletic knit is a global leader in the jersey business and produced in canada with athletic knit many hockey associations know that their deliveries are always on time and they can take that to the bank kohlberg management vi llc recently completed an additional selldown in its position in performance sports group of approximately  million common shares resulting in aggregate proceeds for kohlberg of cad  the selldown of the position leaves kohlberg with  of performance sports groups issued and outstanding common shares on a nondiluted basis which still maintains their position of being one of the largest shareholders of the company performance sports groups first quarter results turned out to be fairly successful the company reported a strong  in total revenue vs a year ago an  increase in hockey revenue and  increase in lacrosse revenue adjusted gross profit increased  to  million and adjusted ebitda grew  to  million an increase in assets coupled with a decrease in liabilities and an increase in equity signals a very positive outlook on the future of the company especially from a shareholders point of view however even though gross profits increased the large expenditure in selling general and administrative expenses resulted in a lower value of net and comprehensive income basic earnings per common share decreased from  to  and diluted earnings per common share from  to  even though more shares were issued the loss suffered in earnings per common share shouldnt have been as drastic as they turned out to be which can be partially blamed on the large increase in selling general and administrative expenses other nyselisted sporting good companies including under armour ua and nike inc nke generally follow a percentageofsales or net income approach when dealing with their expenses for example from  to  under armour experienced an approximate increase in gross profit of  and an approximate  increase in net income accordingly under armours sga expenses experienced reasonable growth of an approximate  on the other hand performance sports groups increase in sga expenses of approximately  is quite large in comparison to its  increase in gross profit and  decrease in net income when examining similar companies in the same industry as performance sports group such a large increase in sga can signal a problem for the common investor who may question how efficiently management is spending the companys money and whether valuable cash flow is being wasted what is encouraging is that the companys longterm debt levels decreased while their shortterm debt levels increased what is discouraging is that none of the upper management owns any shares rbc has a price target of  wunderlichs price target is  and imperial capitals price target is  it has a day average of  i feel that this stock is fairly valued and the average price of approximately  should hold with future headwinds of the higher us dollar rising costs of raw materials and a declining hockey market may prove to be more challenging for performance sports group the acquisitions they made were good and investors can be assured of yearround revenue their sales force needs improvement and until then i have a longterm hold on it of  even though adidas ag otcqxadddf is divesting their interest in reebok adidas will make a bid for the national hockey leagues jerseys in  they have more capital and resources available giving them a substantial advantage over performance sports group in the execution of such a potential deal adidas has two choices with ccm either they sell it or come to terms with the fact that hockey has become a duopoly the advantage of a duopoly is less fragmentation due to only two competitors in the marketplace the question is whether or not adidas is serious in increasing capital expenditure towards ccm to gain on performance sports groups market share this will demonstrate that the adidas ceo is confident in translating the increase in hockey market share towards overall market share in the sporting goods industry a duopoly should not be undermined it should be viewed as an opportunity to increase revenue ccm and reebok dominate the goalie market in the national hockey league even though bauer has indicated that they are the leaders of this position we need to clarify that bauer has  of the head protection market for goaltenders however in terms of protective goal equipment reebok and ccm own about  of the overall market share bauer comes at a distant third in protective goal equipment  of boutique hockey store revenues are generated through the sale of composite sticks individually ranging from  to  many retailers wait for closeout lists to purchase these sticks manufacturers such as warrior easton ccm etc come out with closeout lists taking away available dollars to purchase bauer equipment ccm composite sticks in the high  range are less expensive for retailers than bauer sticks in the same price range closeouts play a significant role increasing margins of hockey retailers suppliers such as easton ccm and warrior offer closeout lists for every retailer in the market on the other hand performance sports group fails to recognize the importance of closeout lists as they only offer them to a select few again its based on patronage from an old boys club instead of valuing revenue as revenue competitors closeouts are not going to return to normal levels anytime soon in fact retailers have indicated that closeouts are coming out earlier than previous years furthermore it takes away opentobuy and creates an anticipatory reaction from retailers to purchase products at a lower price for bauer competitors closeouts provide very little visibility for product repeat demand and may not translate into realized sales or future growth whats alarming is that closeouts reinforce the core business of hockey a sport that is shrinking and deteriorating at a quicker pace than many have anticipated according to the sports and fitness industry global hockey participation and registration has grown at a measly  annually over the last eight years what performance sports group does effectively is spreadsheet coaching the focus is on sales staff hitting numbers the innovation that is taking place in hockey equipment should translate in exceeding expectations rather than meeting a quota what performance sports group lacks is a followthrough in sales which ultimately leads to fizzling sales momentum as an investor i want performance sports group to exceed their expectations brandname exposure in the national hockey league and social media are good tools for creating demand knowledge and perhaps the experience for the product however a strong and innovative sales force is able to articulate to retailers that their money is well spent in the long run this translates into rewards for investors disclosure the author has no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to
