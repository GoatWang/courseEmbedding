from  to july  and led the transition of this excellent medical center into an internationally recognized leader of academic medicine during his tenure the medical school and hospital achieved ranking amongst the nation’s best he oversaw the development of the duke university health system one of the most successful integrated academic health systems in the country and served as its first president and chief executive officer dr snyderman has played a leading role in the conception and development of personalized health care an evolving model of national health care delivery he was among the first to envision and articulate the need to move the current focus of health care from the treatment of diseaseevents to personalized predictive preventative and participatory care that is focused on the patient in  dr snyderman received the david e rogers award from the association of american medical colleges who referred to him as the “father of personalized medicine”dr snyderman has been widely recognized for his contributions to the development of personalized health care a more rational effective and compassionate model of health care  he was awarded the first bravewell leadership award for outstanding achievements in the field of integrative medicine in    in  he received the leadership in personalized medicine award from the personalized medicine coalition for his efforts in advancing predictive and targeted therapies on a national scale  in  dr snyderman received frost  sullivan’s north american healthcare lifetime achievement award for his pioneering spirit and contributions to medicine  in  he received the triangle business journal’s healthcare lifetime achievement award  in  procter  gamble named snyderman an honorary member of the victor mills society for his leadership and impact on innovation and he was recognized as a bioscience leader emeriti by the nc association for biomedical research honoring north carolina research leaders for their outstanding leadership in the transformation of the state through scientific discovery and innovation  in  dr snyderman received the david e rogers award from the association of american medical colleges for his leadership in academic medicine and for the conception of personalized medicine  dr snyderman was awarded the north carolina life sciences leadership award in february dr snyderman has played a prominent role in the leadership of such important national organizations as the association of american physicians the institute of medicine and the association of american medical colleges he is a member of the institute of medicine and the american academy of arts  sciences he served as chair of the aamc in  and president of aap in  he chaired the institute of medicine’s national summit on integrative medicine and the health of the public held in february dr snyderman accepted his first faculty appointment at duke in  and by  he was the frederic m hanes professor of medicine and immunology his research contributed to the understanding of how white blood cells respond to chemical signals to mediate host defense or tissue damage and he is internationally recognized for his contributions in inflammation research in  snyderman left duke to join genentech inc the pioneering biomedical technology firm as senior vice president for medical research and development

james b duke professor of medicine phagocytic leukocytes including neutrophils and macrophages play a critical role in immunologically mediated host defense and tissue destruction these cells migrate to and become activated at sites of inflammation in response to chemoattractant factors including ca interleukin  il formylated peptides eg fmlp leukotriene bltb and platelet activating factor paf the responses of leukocytes to chemoattractants is mediated by g protein coupled receptors the focus of this laboratory has been to define the mechanisms which regulate chemoattractant receptors activation desensitization and priming to study the mechanisms of leukocyte activation we have developed genetic and biochemical techniques we constructed epitopetagged human formylpeptide ca paf ltb and il receptor cdnas and expressed receptors either singly or multiply in a cell line which mimics responses of human inflammatory cells these rblh cells are a basophilic cell line which endogenously contains thrombin receptors using this model system we are studying desensitization crossdesensitization and priming a phenomenon whereby one stimulus leads to greatly enhanced responsiveness to a second stimulus our data have demonstrated an unexpected and interesting complexity in chemoattractant receptor phosphorylation and desensitization we have defined kinases involved in receptor desensitization furthermore we have identified motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of il and paf receptors that appear to be critical for cell activation by their respective ligands we have also identified a new form of chemoattractant receptor desensitization termed class desensitization a major effort of this laboratory is directed at defining the precise molecular events controlling leukocyte activation clinical trials none areas of expertise and national recognition immunology inflammation rheumatology and medical center adminstration current appointments and affiliations james
