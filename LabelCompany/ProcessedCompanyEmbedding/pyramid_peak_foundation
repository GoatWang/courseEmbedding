instagram rss home features columns a guide to the biggest nonprofits in memphis the mule rides again qa with michaelyn bradford a guide to the biggest nonprofits in memphis philanthropy in memphis is booming by john branston july    am back to search results rss print × the old saying “you can’t judge a book by its cover” doesn’t mean as much in these digital times when covers are oftentimes invisible on kindles and other electronicreading devices but it certainly remains true in the world of charitable giving where it’s sometimes impossible to tell what’s nonprofitable about “nonprofits” organizations that qualify for nonprofit status with the irs range from truly grassroots organizations that depend entirely upon a handful of volunteers to pseudocorporations that generate tens of millions of dollars in revenue organizations whose intentions are oftentimes anything but charitable  take this particular nonprofit organization’s selfdescription on its  tax return “a trade association promoting the interests of its  member clubs” so are these a bunch of bluecollar guys in ball caps and leather jackets drinking beer and slapping backs in a fraternal hall or kids gathered in a clubhouse to learn life lessons from a kindly leader in a khaki uniform and smokey the bear hat  not exactly this particular trade association is the national football league and the  member clubs mentioned are the nfl’s  teams buying a “club” these days costs a half billion dollars or more and the organization’s leader commissioner roger goodell is paid  million a year for his trouble nothing better illustrates how meaningless the term “nonprofit” has become at a time when the irs approves hundreds more of them every week putting “nonprofit” and “charity” in the same sentence or headline as often happens makes things even more confusing that’s because “nonprofit” is a generic tax designation that applies to among others private foundations public charities hospitals and universities the nfl until it gave up its nonprofit status this past april habitat for humanity the memphis country club and volunteer organizations that meet for a cup of coffee every so often  this story is about nine of the biggest nonprofits in memphis that focus their attention on the midsouth it includes six private foundations that have one main funding source and do not solicit contributions from the public assisi hyde plough poplar pyramid peak and the urban child institute we’ve also included three major public foundations that act as bankers investors marketers and backoffice managers for all kinds of donors the community foundation of greater memphis the hope christian community foundation and the united way of the midsouth  we do not include alsac st jude because although its headquarters is in memphis its focus is global nor does this report include local hospitals universities or college football bowlgame organizations because the variety of circumstances needing to describe them would fill up the pages of this entire magazine sure each one must submit a detailed form  to the irs but their budgets range from the tens of millions annually to momandpops dependent almost entirely on volunteer labor just about every case is different influencing public policy is one of the primary goals of the six singlesource private nonprofits listed here which is why we consider them the cornerstones of our local philanthropic scene and at a time when city and county budgets are strained philanthropy here is booming thanks to a rising stock market tax incentives and a spirit of giving among wealthy memphians some of whom go to great lengths to do their good works as anonymously as possible  these days “datadriven giving” is the mantra some of our local foundations use the consulting services of another nonprofit the bostonbased the bridgespan group “achieve breakthrough results” for just this purpose bridgespan’s clients include the tennessee achievement school district the salvation army  black men arts memphis the pyramid peak foundation and youth villages  the biggest impact of datadriven giving here perhaps has been in education “school reform” is in the eyes of the beholder but the emergence of charter schools and teach for america as forces in urban education would not have been possible without the financial support of the hyde foundations faithbased outreach to impoverished areas is the forte of the hope foundation the pyramid peak and poplar foundations funded by southeastern asset management founders o mason hawkins and g staley cates respectively have given more than  million to causes ranging from youth athletics to soulsville to leafy bike paths that now extend across the county and the conservancies that manage shelby farms and overton park and the memphis riverfront development corporation are products of twentyfirstcentury philanthropy being used to leverage public dollars  nonprofits have changed our perceptions of “public” salaries because the bigger nonprofits now pay their executives so much more than similar positions in city or county government in  when the memphis flyer our sister publication did its first survey of  local nonprofits the top salaries in the nonprofit sector were around  for the leaders of methodist hospital and rhodes college these would be midlevel executive salaries at many top nonprofits today hospital system ceos now make  million or  million an experienced privateschool leader can make over  nearly twice as much as shelby county schools superintendent dorsey hopson and three times as much as the mayors of memphis and shelby county and the head of the urban child institute makes four times as much as the outgoing director of the shelby county health department a final factor worth mentioning is the increased scrutiny of nonprofits in the digital age form  tax returns in theory at least have always been open to public inspection but getting them in the preinternet era meant battling lawyers secretaries pr firms and nonprofit ceos themselves always with mixed results  today most of this information is readily available at free web sites such as guidestar propublica charity navigator givewell and the national center for charitable statistics there are many recent books about howtogive and howtoget as well as those dedicated to the specifics of smalldonor investing venture philanthropy social investing saving the children saving the elderly saving young black men christian philanthropy jewish philanthropy compassionate conservatives and equally compassionate liberals if there isn’t already a book about how to panhandle effectively at road intersections with a cardboard sign there probably soon will be  two good books for those starting to look into the subject are ken stern’s who really cares  — a readable take on the salvation army’s kroc centers chess in schools bowl games the gates foundation “charity” hospitals the human fund really and bartlettbased youth villages — and arthur c brooks’ with charity for all why charities are failing and a better way to give  more recently the new york times weighed in with an oped piece “who will watch the charities” by david callahan whose premise was that “philanthropies are dangerously opaque” his piece concluded with a call for a new federal bureau to police charities  but policing wouldn’t be all that necessary if local media outlets would spend a fraction as much energy reporting on nonprofits as they do on sports food and murder and mayhem and if the foundations and charities themselves would provide better information in useful and more timely fashion hopefully this column will stimulate more local reporting on the subject hence this modest report on some of memphis’ most important major philanthropic nonprofits the information here is from each individual foundation’s most recent irs form    the community foundations note community foundations there are  of them in the us are designated “public charities” rather than “private foundations” by the irs because they raise a significant portion of their resources from a broad crosssection of the public each year the community foundation of greater memphis cfgmorg ceo robert fockler  salary  assets  million income  million  grants  million source of

sqft   sqft budget m  m two memphis philanthropic foundations teamed up to share new office spaces within a recently renovated sears distribution facility previously vacant for  years each tenant space is primarily made up of private office and meeting roomsa central mass of shared common spaces divide the tenants for selective privacy while allowing for shared resources this primary organizing element is a “bowtie” shaped mass that was developed to obscure the dominant and rigid column grid within the existing space the bowtie is comprised of a common conference room hoteling office storage and wet bar the bowtie also delineates separate entry sequences and offers the capability for dual reception when neededas a method to establish a level of refinement for both tenants the bowtie component is clad with sequenced stained oak panels the mass is carved out by the existing column grid and capitals rendering the emphatic grid less obvious thin staggered planes further obscure the column grid and bound offices their thinness and lack of materiality contrast the mass and rich texture of the bowtie mechanical crossovers bridging the bowtie and offices conceal the
