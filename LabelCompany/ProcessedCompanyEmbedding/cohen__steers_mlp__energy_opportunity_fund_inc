estimates of the funds distribution sources at the time of payment and should not be relied upon or used for tax planning or tax reporting purposes a return of capital occurs when a portion of the money that you invested is paid back to you and should not be confused with “yield” or “income” the source of all distributions paid by the fund including net investment income is subject to change this is because the fund primarily invests in master limited partnerships mlps and similar companies distributions from mlps are attributed to various sources including net investment incomeandor return of capital the estimate shown above is based on the prior year breakdown of the distributions from the mlp securities held by the fund the fund generally will receive from these companies a final determination as to the source of distributions early next year income as determined under federal income tax regulations differs from gaap  the final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after yearend and reported to you on form div and these final amounts may vary significantly from the estimates provided above form div which is mailed after the close of the calendar year will specify how the distributions paid by the fund during the year should be characterized and reported on your tax return eg ordinary income return of capital and capital gain important information not fdic insured • may lose value • no bank guarantee leverage represented as a percentage of the fund’s managed assets as of the most recent month end leverage is created whenever a closedend fund has investment exposure in excess of its net assets the use of leverage is speculative and there are special risks and costs associated with leverage the use of leverage increases the volatility of the funds net asset value in both up and down markets the fund seeks to enhance its dividend yield through leverage but there is no guarantee that the funds leverage strategy will be successful   common share expense ratio excludes deferred tax benefit expense expense ratios as disclosed in the fund’s most recent annual report to stockholders dated november   expense ratios are net of waivers andor reimbursements portfolio holdings are subject to change without notice the mention of specific securities is not a recommendation or solicitation for any person to buy sell or hold any particular security  top ten holdings are determined on the basis of the value of individual securities held the fund may also hold positions in other types of

generally  pm eastern time on each day the nyse is open for trading distribution rate is calculated dividing the last distribution paid per share annualized by the market price note that the number of income distributions is based on the fund’s distribution payment frequency ie monthly or quarterly a fund may pay distributions in excess of its net investment company taxable income and to the extent this occurs the distribution yield quoted will include a return of capital the estimated return of capital for each distribution is also available on this web site by clicking on the distributions tab on each fund’s landing page sec yield is calculated by dividing annualized net investment income per share during a day period by the maximum offering price per share as of the close of that period sec yield reflects the rate at which the fund is earning income on its current portfolio of securities since certain distributions received by the funds from master limited partnerships mlps may consist of dividend income andor return of capital and the character of these distributions cannot be determined until after the end of the year the sec yield has been adjusted for the funds that invest significantly in mlps based on estimates of return of capital quarterly distribution per share is as of the most recent quarter  end the fund pays regular quarterly cash distributions to common shareholders at a level rate that may be adjusted from time to time based on the projected income of the fund the amount of quarterly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors including changes in portfolio and market conditions each fund’s distributions reflect net investment income and may also include net realized capital gains andor return of capital return of capital includes distributions paid by a fund in excess of its net investment income and such excess is distributed from the fund’s assets under federal tax regulations some or all of the return of capital distributed by a fund may be taxed as ordinary income the source of all distributions paid by the fund including net investment income is subject to change this is because the fund invests primarily in master limited partnerships mlps and similar companies distributions from master limited partnerships mlps are estimated as income and return of capital based on information reported by the mlps and management’s estimates of such amounts based on historical information these estimates are adjusted when the actual source of distributions is disclosed by the mlps and actual amounts may differ from the estimated amounts please note that distributions are subject to recharacterization for tax purposes and the final tax treatment of these distributions will be reported to shareholders after the close of each fiscal year on form div on december   the fund completed the previously disclosed change in the fund’s tax status from a regulated investment company to a taxable ccorporation under the internal revenue code the change in tax status enables the fund to invest up to  of its assets in mlps and to continue to pursue its investment objective of attractive total return comprised of high current income and price appreciation the change was in response to the adoption of previously proposed regulations issued by the internal revenue service as a registered investment company taxed as a ccorporation the fund’s income and gains will be taxed under federal and state income tax laws in addition distributions to shareholders from the fund may also be taxed as ordinary income eligible for qualified dividend income treatment for us individual taxpayers in connection with the change in tax status all of the assets and liabilities of the fund’s subsidiary were transferred to the fund in a taxfree transaction additionally the fund’s subsidiary will be dissolved on a future date  risks of investing in mlp securities an investment in mlps involves risks that differ from a similar investment in equity securities such as common stock of a corporation holders of equity securities issued by mlps have the rights typically afforded to limited partners in a limited partnership as compared to common shareholders of a corporation holders of such equity securities have more limited control and limited rights to vote on matters affecting the partnership there are certain tax risks associated with an investment in equity mlp units additionally conflicts of interest may exist among common unit holders subordinated unit holders and the general partner or managing member of an mlp for example a conflict may arise as a result of incentive distribution payments the fund will be subject to more risks related to the energy sector than if the fund were more broadly diversified over numerous sectors of the economy a downturn in the energy sector of the economy could have a larger impact on the fund than on an investment company that does not concentrate in the sector in addition there are several specific risks associated with investments in the energy sector including the following commodity price risk depletion risk supply and demand risk regulatory risk acquisition risk weather risks exploration risk catastrophic event risk interest rate transaction risk affiliated party risk and limited partner risk and risks of subordinated mlp units mlps which invest in the energy industry are highly volatile due to significant fluctuation in the prices of energy commodities as well as political and regulatory developments mlps are subject to significant regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in the regulatory environment including the risk that an mlp could lose its tax status as a partnership mlps may trade less frequently than larger companies due to their small capitalizations which may result in erratic price movement or difficulty in buying or selling a significant portion of the funds distributions will consist of return of capital for us federal tax purposes which reduce a shareholders adjusted cost basis in the funds shares and impacts the amount of any capital gains or loss realized by the shareholder upon selling the funds shares once a shareholders adjusted cost basis has been reduced to zero due to return of capital any further return of capital will be treated as a capital gain mlps may have additional expenses as some mlps pay incentive distribution fees to their general partners the value of mlps depends largely on the mlps being treated as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes if mlps were subject to us federal income taxation distributions generally would be taxed as dividend income as a result aftertax returns could be reduced which could cause a decline in the value of mlps if mlps are unable to maintain partnership status because of tax law changes the mlps would be taxed as corporation and there could be a decrease in the value of the mlp securities  risks of investing in closedend funds risks associated with investing in closedend end funds generally include market risk leverage risk risk of antitakeover provisions and nondiversification in addition shares of many closedend funds frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value the fund is classified as a nondiversified fund under the federal securities laws because it can invest in fewer individual companies than a diversified fund however the fund must meet certain diversification requirements under the us tax laws printemailfor questions call   literaturefact sheetdownloadorder print materialscomplete

to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high above average this funds expenses are rated as above average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other characteristics before making your investment decisionlearn more morningstar® snapshot as

rated its risk between the th and th percentiles when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated risk is calculated using the sharpe ratio which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other characteristics before making your investment
