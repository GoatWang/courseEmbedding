and price flexibility in product markets nber working paper no w  pages posted  jun    r glenn hubbard columbia business school  finance and economics national bureau of economic research nberrobert j weiner george washington university  department of international business date written october  abstract the search for microeconomic foundations of nonwalrasian outcomes in labor and product markets has spawned many studies of contracting this paper emphasizes the role of contracts for market equilibrium  for many raw materials and basic industrial commodities  in which longterm contractual arrangements and spot markets coexist our principal goals are two  i to explain the existence of contracts and the equilibrium fraction of trades carried out under contract and ii to consider the impact of demand and supply shocks on spot prices when market trades also take place through longterm contracts we find that the relative importance of contracting depends on inter alia the variance of the spot price and the sources of underlying fluctuations consistent with the findings of previous macroeconomic studies we find that contracting and price rigidity are more likely the more important demand shocks are relative to supply shocks we adapt our static model of contract price and quantity determination to discuss the adjustment of contract prices finally we discuss three important applications of our multipleprice modeling structure  to i analyses of the effects of changes in vertical market structure on market equilibrium in commodity markets with specific reference to petroleum and copper ii models of the optimal degree of contract indexationand iii aggregate studies of sticky prices in macroeconomics suggested citation suggested citation hubbard r glenn and

volatility caused by shortterm capital inflows under this framework the cbt implements its monetary policy in two ways firstly it can alter the interest rates of weekly repo as well as on lending rate secondly it can configure the funding structure it provides to the financial intermediaries in such a framework the interest rate transmission mechanism has been operated by two benchmark interest

resolved for the period – the period when detailed banklevel data are available by disaggregating taking account of regulatory limits and considering differences in banks’ opportunity costs crosssectionally and over time banks with poor lending opportunities issued more within regulatory limits banks tended to issue more when bond yields the backing for notes were high relative to lending opportunities the profitability of note issuance was insufficient to attract entrants primarily or mainly for the purpose of note issuance the observed lack of a general relationship between note issuance and reserve demand is inconsistent with the view that redemption costs from note issuance explain low note issuance in general however some variation in the propensities of urban banks to issue notes is associated with variation in reserve demand costs associated with the note issues of those banks generally however note issuance enjoyed economies of scope with deposit banking
