representing diluted earnings per share of  adjusted ebitda a nongaap financial measure increased to  million from  million in the fiscal second quarter  representing  growth and the opening of two franchise restaurants and one companyoperated restaurant john d cappasola jr president and chief executive officer of del taco commented “strong product promotions during the fiscal second quarter including our jumbo shrimp limited time offer the refresh of our breakfast menu in march and dedicated marketing windows for the del taco and platos resulted in outstanding growth in comparable restaurant sales our enviable track record at companyoperated restaurants now consists of  consecutive quarters of positive comparable restaurant sales with positive transactions in  of the past  quarters” cappasola continued “we are pleased to raise key elements of our  annual guidance on the strength of our fresh combined solutions strategy with the onset of our fiscal third quarter we began lapping our most successful product launch in brand history the del taco and yet our comparable restaurant sales remain strong trending up double digits on a twoyear basis through the first  weeks of the fiscal third quarter our playbook for this rollover is driven by our holistic combined solutions approach using a strategic combination of restaurant improvements to drive guest experiences and new product news with compelling value to drive guest trial and frequency this includes our new carnitas limited time offer which is driving strong sales mix and guest satisfaction” cappasola concluded “we believe our lineup of new products and marketing along with our continued focus on improving operations will further embed our qsr positioning to drive brand momentum as we close in on our  million average unit volume goal and accelerate system unit growth” review of fiscal second quarter  financial results total revenue was  million an increase of  compared to  million in the fiscal second quarter  the growth in revenue was driven by an  increase in company restaurant sales and a  increase in franchise revenue comparable restaurant sales increased  systemwide for the fiscal second quarter  resulting in a  increase on a twoyear basis the del taco system has now generated comparable restaurant sales growth for  consecutive quarters companyoperated comparable restaurant sales increased  marking the th consecutive quarter of comparable restaurant sales growth franchise comparable restaurant sales increased  net income was  million representing  per diluted share compared to  million in the fiscal second quarter  representing  per diluted share restaurant contribution a nongaap financial measure increased  yearoveryear to  million as a percentage of company restaurant sales restaurant contribution margin fell approximately  basis points yearoveryear to  the decrease in restaurant contribution margin was driven by a  basis point increase in labor and related expenses and a  basis point increase in food and paper costs partially offset by improvements in other operating expenses a reconciliation between restaurant contribution and the nearest gaap financial measure is included in the accompanying financial data adjusted ebitda a nongaap financial measure increased to  million compared to  million in the previous year’s fiscal second quarter representing  growth a reconciliation between adjusted ebitda and the nearest gaap financial measure is included in the accompanying financial data restaurant portfolio during the fiscal second quarter  we and our franchise partners opened one and two restaurants respectively there were also two company restaurant closures thus far in the fiscal third quarter  our franchise partners have opened two restaurants and there are currently  restaurants one franchised and nine company under construction all of which are expected to open this fiscal year repurchase program for common stock and warrants during the fiscal second quarter  we purchased  warrants from pw acquisitions lp a related party for  per warrant at the end of the fiscal second quarter approximately  million remained under our  million repurchase authorization fiscal year  guidance we are raising key elements of our guidance for fiscal year  which is a week period ending january   and reaffirming other elements systemwide comparable restaurant sales growth of approximately  to  previously  to  total revenue between  million and  million previously  million and  million total companyoperated restaurant sales between  million and  million previously  million and  million restaurant contribution margin between  and  reaffirming general and administrative expenses of between approximately  and  of total revenue previously  and  effective tax rate of approximately  reaffirming diluted earnings per share of approximately  to  reaffirming adjusted ebitda between  million and  million previously  million and  million  to  new systemwide restaurant openings reaffirming and net capital expenditures totaling approximately  million to  million reaffirming we have not reconciled guidance for adjusted ebitda to the corresponding gaap financial measure because we do not provide guidance for the various reconciling items we are unable to provide guidance for these reconciling items because we cannot determine their probable significance as certain items are outside of our control and cannot be reasonably predicted due to the fact that these items could vary significantly from period to period accordingly a reconciliation to the corresponding gaap financial measure is not available without unreasonable effort conference call a conference call and webcast to discuss del taco’s financial results is scheduled for  pm et today hosting the conference call and webcast will be john d cappasola jr president and chief executive officer and steven l brake executive vice president and chief financial officer interested parties may listen to the conference call via telephone by dialing  a telephone replay will be available shortly after the call has concluded and can be accessed by dialing  the passcode is  the webcast will be available at wwwdeltacocom under the investors section and will be archived on the site shortly after the call has concluded key financial definitions comparable restaurant sales growth reflects the change in yearoveryear sales for the comparable company franchise and total system restaurant base restaurants are included in the comparable store base in the accounting period following its th full month of operations and excludes restaurant closures restaurant contribution is defined as company restaurant sales less restaurant operating expenses which are food and paper costs labor and related expenses and occupancy and other operating expenses restaurant contribution margin is defined as restaurant contribution as a percentage of company restaurant sales restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are neither required by nor presented in accordance with gaap restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are supplemental measures of operating performance of restaurants and the calculations thereof may not be comparable to those reported by other companies restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of results as reported under us gaap management believes that restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are important tools for investors because they are widelyused metrics within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurantlevel productivity efficiency and performance management uses restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin as key performance indicators to evaluate the profitability of incremental sales at del taco restaurants to evaluate restaurant performance across periods and to evaluate restaurant financial performance compared with competitors a reconciliation between restaurant contribution and the nearest gaap financial measure is included in the accompanying financial data adjusted ebitda is defined as net incomeloss prior to interest expense income taxes and depreciation and amortization as adjusted to add back certain charges such as stockbased compensation expense and transactionrelated costs as these expenses are not considered an indicator of ongoing company performance adjusted ebitda is a nongaap financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net incomeloss as a measure of operating performance or cash flows or as measures of liquidity nongaap financial measures are not necessarily calculated the same way by different companies and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results we believe adjusted ebitda facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies these potential differences may be caused by variations in capital structures affecting interest expense tax positions such as the impact on periods or changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment affecting relative depreciation expense we also present adjusted ebitda because i we believe this measure is frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry ii we believe investors will find this measure useful in assessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness and iii we use adjusted ebitda internally as a benchmark to compare performance to that of competitors a reconciliation between adjusted ebitda and the nearest gaap financial measure is included in the accompanying financial data about del taco restaurants inc del taco nasdaq taco offers a unique variety of both mexican and american favorites such as burritos and fries prepared fresh in every restaurant’s working kitchen with the value and convenience of a drive thru del taco’s menu items taste better
