outperformed the benchmark the bloomberg barclays us aggregate index for the quarter ended june   results from the portfolio management team’s bottomup security selection process were on full display

fund i class shares outperformed the benchmark the bloomberg barclays us aggregate index for the quarter ended june   results from the portfolio management team’s bottomup security selection process were on full display in the second quarter as they were able to add value in nearly every broad sector through security selection outperformance was especially high in abs and investmentgrade corporate bonds an underweight to us treasuries and an overweight to spread products including nonagency mortgages abs commercial mortgagebacked securities cmbs and corporate bonds helped as spreads narrowed the funds duration and yield curve positioning were both headwinds in the previous quarter the fund was underweight in interest rate duration as intermediate and long rates fell in addition the fund was underweight in the bestperforming year portion of the curve the portfolio management team overweighted mbs and abs which underperformed other broad investmentgrade sectors on an absolute basis this was partially offset by positive security selection in these sectors looking ahead the portfolio management team continues to focus on providing clients with a highquality “true core” fixed income portfolio our process seeks high correlation with our benchmark and has historically delivered negative correlations to risky assets we continue to position the portfolio for the possibility of higher interest rates our lower duration underweight to the most volatile year portion of the curve and higher spread and carry versus the fund’s benchmark are all characteristics that could help us

investing funds and etfs basics investing strategies corporate  high yield municipal income investing risks advanced strategies news view all by thomas kenny updated april   core bond funds offer investors a single diversified bond fund product with broad exposure to the investmentgrade area of the bond market they provide participation in several market segments most notably us treasuries mortgagebacked securities and investment grade corporate bonds they are also designed to provide a full range of maturities  short intermediate and long in each area core fund is a relatively new term –  many bond funds in this category have changed their names to include the word “core”two types of core funds active and passivecore bond funds can either be active which means that the managers frequently change the portfolio’s makeup to capture opportunities or avoid risk or passive which means they track an index an essential difference between the two is that active managers attempt to achieve better than average market results while passive funds simply try to match the return of the corresponding index  that is to do no worse or better  than the average the relative advantages and disadvantages of active vs passive funds are not widely agreed upon  each investment type has its advocates and detractorsbond index funds although not carrying the “core” label can in fact represent an appropriate single bond investment for many investors funds that track an investmentgrade bond index such as the barclays aggregate index have several advantages including broad diversification low management expenses and the certainty that the fund will not suffer extreme underperformance in a given year due to a manager’s bad decisions at the same time however some index funds may have a higher weighting in government bonds and consequently a relatively high sensitivity to interest rate movements and as noted by definition they are unlikely to do better than averagetwo important drawbacks of core bond fundsbe aware that not every issuer views the concept of “core” in the same way  the word has no fixed or generally agreed upon meaning a core fund issued by one company may look much different than a core fund issued by another in addition active managers can take a wide range of approaches  with varying degrees of success in addition certain funds will adopt more of a “goanywhere” approach that incorporates high yield bonds or other investments not held in the investment grade indices since there is so much variability within the category it pays to investigate each fund closely to see what it actually holds how it has performed over time and how it has held up during market downturns in short don’t assume on the basis of the name alone that a core bond fund meets your objectivesanother issue with core funds is that most don’t hold weightings in international emerging market or high yield bonds as a result core bond funds may not necessarily provide the level of diversification that investors expect also since investments in international and emerging market segments tend to have lower exposure to interest rate movements than a typical core fund with significant holdings in treasuries and corporate bonds a core fund may have greater exposure to interest rate risk than a fully diversified portfolio an investor who wants to achieve total diversification may consider supplementing their core funds with high yield andor international fundshow to invest in core bond fundsinvestors have the choice

farrellby luke farrellluke farrelljanuary  how should one think about positioning a core bond portfolio in today’s market capital group portfolio manager john smet shares the strategy he is pursuing john smetcapital group portfolio manager years of investment experienceluke farrellcapital group investment directorview transcriptluke farrell john let’s shift gears a bit and talk about the strategies that you might be employing in a core allocation as you look forwardjohn smet currently we’ve been looking at the fiveyear and the twoyear treasury and we’ve been seeing some value in that area i mean rates have backed up and we’ve begun to start to buy a little bit in that area i talked about liquidity and having a portfolio that really will benefit from volatility and benefit from opportunities i think that’s the position we’re in today we have a high conviction that treasury inflationprotected securities tips will do wellbut we really have not overcommitted to any sector we have not overcommitted to corporate bonds we have a very low position in highyield bonds we have a very low position in emerging market bonds and as we look at the valuations of emerging markets and highyield and corporate bonds we just don’t see a lot of value there so that’s what we’ve really focused on in an environment where we think volatility is going to be high valuations are not great we want to be in a liquid portfolio that can take advantage as opportunities present themselvesluke farrell now you talked about being low in credit and low in high yield what is your view on credit given the increased leverage on corporate balance sheetsjohn smet so if you look at the valuation today we’re about as tight on spreads — and by spreads i mean the yield advantage of owning a corporate over a treasury — as we’ve been in the last three years so when our analysts come back to us and tell us they say they don’t see a lot of value and great valuations in your average corporate bond i think if you look at how we’ve managed money we’ve got a low weighting in corporate bonds but really through our analytical talent we’ve been able to take advantage of opportunities in so we’ve done a great job taking advantage of energy for instance and pipelines which were very cheap at the beginning of the year and have really done quite well there has also been some large issuance in the pharmaceuticals sector and the consumer nondurables that we were able to take advantage of buying large issuances when they’re cheap so while we don’t have a lot of bonds we’ve really added value with our selection of bonds and i think as we move into  that’s what we’re looking forluke farrell now you talked about the value added from the bottom up from credit research but what would cause you to change your view on credit overall and have a more bullish viewjohn smet valuations i mean if we saw cheapening in valuations — whether it’s because of forced liquidations of competitors’ funds or if we saw a volatility increase lead to wider spreads — we would really take advantage of that and buy corporate bonds one of the things that has happened with this talk about fiscal expansion is it really — in our minds — has taken the recession off the table in  or  so while we don’t think growth is going to be real high we think it’ll continue to be that   so while companies have leverage the macro environment is still not bad for corporates so if we see a highquality corporation bond issued at a wider spread we would be in a great position to take advantage of thatclose xsign up now to
