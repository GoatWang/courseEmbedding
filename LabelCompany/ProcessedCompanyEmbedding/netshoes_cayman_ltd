from our sale of  common shares or us million if the underwriters exercise in full their overallotment option after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us we believe that the offering will provide additional capital to support the development and growth of our business the principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization provide us with greater financial flexibility create a public market for our common shares and facilitate our future access to the capital markets we currently intend to use our net proceeds from this offering to finance our working capital needs and capital expenditures which may include among others investments in the development of software acquisition of property and equipment for our distribution centers although we have no present commitments or agreements to enter into any investments any remaining net proceeds will be used for other general corporate purposes pending determination of the use of our net proceeds we may invest them in highly liquid time deposits and similar instruments our management will have broad discretion in allocating the net proceeds of this offering received by us to each use ecommerce in latin america includes a number of local players and a few global companies focused on a wide variety of categories based on management’s experience in and knowledge of the industry we do not believe we have a relevant direct competitor in the ecommerce sports category in the region where we are the leader in brazil and while we face competition in our fashion and beauty categories in just one year of operation we believe we have become a clear contender for the market leader in brazil our current or potential competitors include the following • brickandmortar stores we face competition from brickandmortar retailers specialized in sporting goods fashion and beauty and general brickandmortar retailers some of which currently also sell or in the future may sell their products online based on management’s experience in and knowledge of the industry we believe that most existing brick and mortar retail players in latin america have limited ecommerce presence and are often focused on specific categories which in general are not core to us such as electronics and household appliances we believe that most retailers’ constraint to physical locations results in limited product offerings and restricts their operations to narrower geographies in summary we believe based on management’s experience in and knowledge of the industry that the nature of the ecommerce platforms developed by most brickandmortar stores is more of a complementary service rather than a priority for their business our platform on the other hand provides a unique solution to customers and focuses on more attractive product categories with a team of professionals solely dedicated to delivering a bestinclass customer service and • pureplay ecommerce players we face competition from a other bc ecommerce retailers b retailers and other sellers that conduct commerce through online marketplaces and c a number of indirect competitors including internet portals and internet search engines that are involved in online commerce either directly or in collaboration with other retailers we believe that based on management’s experience in and knowledge of the industry pureplay sports ecommerce players are fragmented within the region with no company having achieved scale other than us moreover no consolidation strategy has been deployed by any local or global player we believe our  growth in consolidated net sales for the year ended december   was above the average of retail industries in brazil according to euromonitor international in  the total retail market in brazil grew by  the internet retail market in brazil grew by  and the market for pure play internet retailers in brazil grew by  company description our mission is to be the leading online consumer platform in latin america we are the leading sports and lifestyle online retailer in latin america and one of the largest online retailers in the region as measured by net sales we operate in brazil argentina and mexico and since our launch we have sold to more than  million customers across our sites representing a  yearoveryear growth from  solidifying our position as one of the few scaled online retailers in latin america and creating a foundation of audience brand and capabilities on top of which we are building a digital ecosystem capable of delivering increasing and significant value to customers and partners in the future through our desktop and mobile websites and applications which we refer to as our “sites” we deliver our customers a convenient and intuitive online shopping experience across our two core brands netshoes and zattini we believe that netshoes has become one of the most recognized brands by consumers in brazil and argentina among both online and offline sports retailers we believe that zattini a site we launched in december  is quickly becoming a leading online brand for fashion and beauty in brazil in terms of consumer recognition we were founded in january  by marcio kumruian and hagop chabab as a single physical shoe store in são paulo brazil in  we closed our brickandmortar stores and shifted to an online business to reach more customers across brazil since then we have built on our initial success expanding across geographies and brands we have also selectively introduced new product categories maintaining our core strategy of focusing on product verticals with higher margins that have short replacement cycles and are easy to ship core to our success has been a relentless focus on delivering a superior customer experience across each of the countries in which we operate including remote locations not typically served by traditional retailers as one of the first companies in latin america to provide online retail offerings we have emphasized the importance of customer service and we have also developed technology that personalizes the shopping experience for our customers this core customer focus has driven customer loyalty as demonstrated by our high repeat purchasing in the year ended december    of our total orders came from repeat customers our sites are also optimized for mobile shopping despite latin america’s relatively low smartphone penetration rate in the year ended december   approximately  of total visits to our sites and  of the total orders placed by our active customers came from mobile devices while in brazil mobile commerce accounted for  of ecommerce sales in  we are also a trusted partner and the goto channel for the most important brands in sports and lifestyle retail in brazil argentina and mexico we offer over  stock keeping units or skus from over  brands including nike adidas mizuno tommy hilfiger ralph lauren and lacoste and work closely with our suppliers to promote and protect their brands and help manage product selection we believe we are one of the largest distribution channels for these brands in brazil and latin america we have also begun to develop our private label brands to supplement our existing supplier relationships in key categories our success in the region has been dependent on our consistent ability to build a solid infrastructure network to support our operations as well as our scalable and customized logistics capabilities we have created a highly automated picking packing and inventory management system built to efficiently handle the products in which we specialize—easytoship items with high margins and short replacement cycles we are able to ship over one million orders a month and on average process the orders we receive within six hours after confirmation achieving an ontime delivery rate of approximately  of total processed orders at the scale at which we operate the combination of our customers the brands we offer and infrastructure we have developed has resulted in powerful network effects which we believe offer a significant competitive advantage our large and growing latin america customer base has allowed us to attract and retain high quality brands which in turn drives new and repeat customers this has driven our growth and has allowed us to continually reinvest in and improve our product selection technology and infrastructure while also driving significant cost efficiencies these network effects are evident in our financial performance and scale we also believe that these favorable network effects allow us to expand the reach of our sites to build the leading online consumer platform in brazil and latin america we have achieved the following significant milestones as of and for the year ended december   •  million active customers an increase of  from the  million active customers we had as of december   •  million total orders on our sites an
