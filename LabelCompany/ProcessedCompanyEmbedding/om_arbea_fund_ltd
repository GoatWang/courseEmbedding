wed    tags  investing in hedge funds old mutual global investors has launched an offshore cayman hedge fund based on its launched ucitscompliant global equity absolute return fund the fund is called the old mutual arbea fund and will be managed by the same team as the usdmillion gear fund ian heslop head portfolio manager amadeo alentorn and mike servent the fund uses a systematic global market neutral strategy and since  has generated annualised returns of  per cent with volatility of  per cent it is already up an impressive  per cent ytd and aims to deliver genuinely uncorrelated returns whereas the gear fund aims to return cash plus  to  per cent with a similar volatility target the offshore arbea fund – which uses the same investment process  sets its sights higher speaking at a press lunch in london on tuesday  july  donald pepper who joined old mutual as managing director of alternatives last december said “we will keep this sensibly calibrated ucits version for hnw investors private banks and family offices we have recalibrated the riskreturn profile of the offshore cayman fund to deliver higher expected returns that longerterm institutional investors are seeking the aim is to target a higher volatility of  to  per cent for expected returns of cash plus  to  per cent” as well as wanting to deliver a higher riskreturn profile for investors another reason for launching an offshore version of the gear fund is that the alternative ucits market only represents around  per cent of the alternatives marketplace as pepper added the arbea fund will now “help us to target the other  per cent of the marketplace” this is the third hedge fund in the old mutual global advisors’ stable the other two funds include the uk specialist equity fund managed by ashton bradbury since inception in march  and the global statistical arbitrage fund managed by paul simpson and john dow these hedge funds – and the gear fund  have delivered positive returns in  out of the  years or so they have been running on aggregate the three funds along with the new arbea fund run approximately usdmillion of assets since pepper joined omgi the focus has been on recalibrating the funds to better reflect investor needs as pepper explained “when i joined there were things that needed fixing but the actual investment process for all three funds was excellent “basically volatility was too low meaning the return target was too low as well also us investors in particular don’t like investing with managers who do not have enough ‘skin in the game’ so the decision was taken to use our own seed capital to demonstrate our commitment to the strategy” this has resulted in usdmillion of seed capital from old mutual being used to launch the arbea fund which pepper said demonstrates the firms commitment to its hedge fund business and more specifically “to the strategy of ians team” a further usdmillion of acceleration capital has been approved for the uk specialist equity fund in addition both hedge funds have been recalibrated the global statistical arbitrage fund has increased its leverage from  per cent to  per cent effective from  august  while gross exposure has been ramped up in the uk specialist equity fund “previously it was using too small a gross capital base so we’ve raised that to  per cent already in the first half of  the fund is up  per cent and we have increased our annualised target returns to  to  per cent which we expect to attract investor interest” confirmed pepper the arbea fund is fully systematic with heslop and his team employing a rigorous bottomup fundamental stock selection strategy said heslop “alongside that fundamental stock selection is a recognition that everything you invest in is cyclical and it’s that cyclicality that you need to manage for two reasons to mitigate downside risk and because the cyclicality of returns is driven by market timing which leads to correlation market neutrality alone is not sufficient to deliver uncorrelated returns any market neutral portfolio if it wants to be successful must deal with the correlation issue in the stock selection process especially with intrasector stock correlations and regional stock correlations remaining high since the gear fund launched in  the msci world index has been down  of  months the investment strategy however has been able to generate positive returns in  of those  downmarket months demonstrating its effectiveness the team does not try to forecast macro fundamentally it looks at what type of stocks will outperform in any given market environment “we want to buy stocks that are trading below their fundamental valuation and short stocks that are trading above their fundamental value” added heslop to deal with the correlation element and market cyclicality the portfolio is diversified as much as possible into multiple stock selection categories the investment process uses a number of inputs including dynamic valuation sustainable growth analyst sentiment company management to determine how and where to trade “we aggregate all of these things from the bottom up and also incorporate market dynamics price characteristics to isolate stocks that are trending and stocks that reversing we use volatility to try and predict when trends might break and shortterm momentum signals to try and isolate whether or not we are still in a trending environment” commented heslop currently the portfolio has around  stocks returns are derived from all five stock selection criteria as well as market sectors and geographies “we build our market neutral positions across four global regions we are not taking bets like long japan short europe it’s all about finding mispriced stock selections within regions correlation to the market is just  so we’re really pleased about that” with pepper at the helm omgi is looking forward to working with institutional investors and building its alternatives business “we aim to double our total hedge fund aum to usdbillion during this year and to reach usdbillion within the next few years” said pepper like this article  get the free daily newsletter print email
