other treatment response and adverse reactions description of the related art  reference to any prior art in this specification is not and should not be taken as an acknowledgment or any form of suggestion that this prior art forms a part of the common general knowledge in any country  psychological “disorders” are endemic in many societies reference to “disorders” in this context means that an individual exhibits behavioral patterns which are inconsistent with societal norms most psychological phenotypes have both environmental and genetic risk factors the basis of these disorders is in many cases significantly genetic for example early detection of disorders such as schizophrenia using genetic technology has considerable potential to identify those at risk prior to the development of this chronic condition commencement of a low dose antipsychotic regime and early cognitive behavioral therapy may prevent the emergence of the full disorder development of the full disorder is associated with significant impairment of social cognitive and occupational functioning in australia the morbidity and mortality data for those with schizophrenia are similar to the poor health outcomes faced by other disenfranchised groups such as indigenous australians  schizophrenia is a particularly complex psychological phenotype schizophrenia is a common chronic disabling illness with an incidence of  new cases per  population per year kelly et al ir j med sci   additionally “unaffected” first degree relatives show both child niendam et al am j psychiatry   and adult macdonald et al arch gen psychiatry   deficits in cognitive functioning siblings of those with schizophrenia also exhibit an abnormal mri response in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex implicating inefficient information processing callicott et al am j psychiatry   furthermore both those with schizophrenia and their unaffected siblings show both reductions in hippocampal volume and hippocampal shape deformity tepest et al biol psychiatry   decreased temporoparietal p amplitude and increased frontal p amplitude are found in both schizophrenic patients and their siblings winterer et al arch gen psychiatry   taken together these findings indicate that the underlying pathophysiological state of schizophrenia is considerably more widespread in the general population than prevalence figures for schizophrenia would suggest and that a considerable genetic vulnerability for this disorder exists  the apparent high genetic risk for schizophrenia has led to considerable research efforts aimed at the identification of susceptibility genes this has resulted in linkages or associations with regions p q and q with single studies reporting significance at p owen et al mol psychiatry   although a large multicentre linkage study of schizophrenia loci on chromosome q failed to find any evidence for linkage or association to schizophrenia mowry et al mol psychiatry  other regions that may be implicated include p q qq pp and q owen et al supra  despite this limited progress the conclusive identification of specific molecular genetic etiological factors in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia has not occurred miyamoto et al mol intervent   however it is clear from epidemiological studies gottesman i i et al proc natl acad sci usa   mcgue m et al arch gen psych  that the mode of transmission is complex and the predisposition of disease is most likely due to multiple genes exerting modest to small effect risch gen epidemiol    several lines of evidence have implicated the dopamine  receptor drd gene and genes related to neurotransmitters that influence dopamine function as candidates gene for schizophrenia genetic susceptibility for example all antipsychotic medications are either antagonists or partial agonists of drd drd receptor has been repeatedly demonstrated to be the primary site of action for these medications seeman and kapur proc natl acad sci usa   indicating that schizophrenic symptoms are ameliorated by a reduction in drd function additionally recent evidence strongly suggests that schizophrenic patients have increased brain drd density abidargham et al proc natl acad sci   recently several genotyping studies have identified an association of the ct polymorphism rs of the drd gene and schizophrenia in northern european spanish and finnish populations lawford et al schizo res   hoenicka et al acta psychiatr scand   hanninen et al neuros lett   in addition a gene located in close proximity to the drd locus the ankyrin repeat and protein kinase domaincontaining protein  ankk gene has been associated with schizophrenia dubretret et al schizophrenia res   dubretret et al schizophrenia res    dystrobrevin binding protein  or dysbindin dtnbp is the most convincing susceptibility gene for schizophrenia to date norton et al curr opin psychiatr   dtnbp maps to chromosome p which is a consistently replicated schizophrenia linkage region group am j med genet   lewis et al am j hum genet   screening of exons has failed to identify mutations that associate nonsynonymous alleles with disease suggesting that susceptibility variants may affect mrna expression or processing williams et al arch gen psychiatry   recent studies have shown that schizophrenia patients have lower mrna concentrations in the prefrontal cortex and midbrain when compared to controls talbot et al j clin invest   weickert et al arch gen psychiatry   the mechanisms of vulnerability to schizophrenia remain uncertain however and recent study has shown dtnbp to be located presynaptically in glutamatergic neurons talbot et al supra  this observation may confer the vulnerability of schizophrenia through aberrant regulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission  regulator of gprotein signalling  rsg is located within a putative linkage region at chromosome q a global study of expression has identified a decrease in rsg expression in prefrontal cortex of individuals with schizophrenia mimics et al mol psychiatry   chowdari et al hum mol genet   in addition variants in the ′ flanking region and the first intron are modestly associated with increased schizophrenia vulnerability owen et al psychiatric genetics and genomics   the mechanism of susceptibility to schizophrenia remains unclear however the rsg gene product downregulates effects at gproteincoupled receptor including the dopamine and serotonin receptors furthermore rsg expression is modulated by stress ni et al j neurosci   and is a known contributor factor to major metal illness including bipolar disorder berrettini am j med genet c  shifman et al am j hum genet   therefore it is possible that rsg plays a role through these pathways to confer susceptibility to schizophrenia  catecholomethyl transferase comt is localized to chromosomal region q and has been identified as the second greatest risk factor for mental illness bassett et al biol psychiatry   murphy k c lancet   comt catalyzes the omethylation of catecholamine neurotransmitters and catechol hormones leading to their inactivation in addition comt also shortens the biological halflives of certain neuroactive drugs like ldopa alphamethyl dopa and isoproterenol reports implicating the role of comt in schizophrenia have been inconsistent however the weight of evidence seems to favour the involvement of comt in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia shifman et al supra  a functional variant has been demonstrated to play a role in regulating aspects of cognitive functioning egan et al proc natl acad sci usa   and it has been proposed that decreased expression of comt is involved in schizophrenia bray et al am j hum genet j  in addition comt has been implicated in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder implying that these conditions share some genetic vulnerability factors berrettini supra  shifman et al supra  however the pathogenic mechanisms of comt are yet to be fully elucidated imbalances in glutamate have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia the metabotropic glutamate receptor  grm is a receptor for glutamate and has been mapped to chromosome q scherer et al genomics   and may contribute to a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia marti et al am j med genet   fujii y et al psychiatr genet    genetic analysis has implicated the disrupted in schizophrenia  disc gene with a spectrum of major mental illness including schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder bipolar affective disorder and major depression emerging evidence from these studies have identified a casual relationship between disc and directly measurable traits such as working memory cognitive aging decreased gray matter volume in the prefrontal cortex abnormalities in hippocampal structure and function and a reduction in the amplitude of the p eventrelated potential disc binds to a number of proteins involved in essential functions of neuronal function including neural migration neurite outgrowth cytoskeletal modulation and signal transduction yamada et al biol psychiatry   millar et al science    hydroxytryptamine serotonin receptor a htra has been implicated as a functional candidate in many neuropsychiatric phenotypes including schizophrenia attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd affective disorders

wileyintersciences new york  this analysis may also include a regression calculation of which polymorphic sites in the gene profile which gives the most significant contribution to the differences in phenotype one regression model useful in the invention starts with a model of the form  rr s×d  where r is the response r is a constant called the “intercept” s is the slope and d is the dose to determine the dose the mostcommon and least common nucleotides at the polymorphic site are first defined then for each individual in the trial population one calculates a “dose” as the number of leastcommon nucleotides the individual has at the polymorphic site of interest this value can be  homozygous for the leastcommon nucleotide  heterozygous or  homozygous for the most common nucleotide an individuals “response” is the value of the clinical measurement standard linear regression methods are then used to fit all the individuals doses and responses to a single model see eg fisher and vanbelle supra ch  the outputs of the regression calculation are the intercept r the slope s and the variance which measures how well the data fits this simple linear model the students ttest value

consistent with societal “norms”  reference herein to an “individual” includes a human which may also be considered a subject patient host recipient or target  the present invention enables therefore a stratification of individuals based on a genetic profile the stratification or profiling enables early diagnosis conformation of a clinical diagnosis treatment monitoring and treatment selection for a neurological psychiatric or psychological conditions phenotype or state  there are many methods which may be used to detect a dna sequence profile direct dna sequencing either manual sequencing or automated fluorescent sequencing can detect sequence variation including a polymorphism or mutation another approach is the singlestranded conformation polymorphism assay sscp orita et al proc natl acad sci usa   this method does not detect all sequence changes especially if the dna fragment size is greater than  bp but can be optimized to detect most dna sequence variation the reduced detection sensitivity is a disadvantage but the increased throughput possible with sscp makes it an attractive viable alternative to direct sequencing for mutation detection the fragments which have shifted mobility on sscp gels are then sequenced to determine the exact nature of the dna sequence variation other approaches based on the detection of mismatches between the two complementary dna strands include clamped denaturing gel electrophoresis cdge sheffield et al proc natl acad sci usa   heteroduplex analysis ha white et al genomics   and chemical mismatch cleavage cmc grompe et al proc natl acad sci usa   none of the methods described above detects large deletions duplications or insertions nor will they detect a mutation in a regulatory region or a gene other methods which would detect these classes of mutations include a protein truncation assay or the asymmetric assay a review of currently available methods of detecting dna sequence variation can be found in kwok curr issues mol biol   twyman and primrose pharmacogenomics   edwards and bartlett methods mol biol   and brennan am j pharmacogenomics   once a mutation is known an allelespecific detection approach such as allelespecific oligonucleotide aso hybridization can be utilized to rapidly screen large numbers of other samples for that same mutation such a technique can utilize probes which are labeled with gold nanoparticles or any other reporter molecule to yield a visual color result elghanian et al science    a rapid preliminary analysis to detect polymorphisms in dna sequences can be performed by looking at a series of southern blots of dna cut with one or more restriction enzymes preferably with a large number of restriction enzymes each blot contains a series of normal individuals and a series of individuals having neurologic or neuropsychiatric diseases or disorders or any other neurological psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or state southern blots displaying hybridizing fragments differing in length from control dna when probed with sequences near or to the genetic locus being tested indicate a possible mutation or polymorphism if restriction enzymes which produce very large restriction fragments are used then pulsed field gel electrophoresis pfge is employed alternatively the desired region of the genetic locus being tested can be amplified the resulting amplified products can be cut with a restriction enzyme and the size of fragments produced for the different polymorphisms can be determined  detection of point mutations may be accomplished by molecular cloning of the target genes and sequencing the alleles using techniques well known in the art also the gene or portions of the gene may be amplified eg by pcr or other amplification technique and the amplified gene or amplified portions of the gene may be sequenced  methods for a more complete yet still indirect test for confirming the presence of a susceptibility allele include  singlestranded conformation analysis sscp orita et al supra   denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis dgge wartell et al nucl acids res   sheffield et al supra   rnase protection assays finkelstein et al genomics   kinszler et al science    allelespecific oligonucleotides asos conner et al proc natl acad sci usa    the use of proteins which recognize nucleotide mismatches such as the e coli muts protein modrich ann rev genet    allelespecific pcr ruano and kidd nucl acids res   and  pcr amplification of the site of the polymorphism followed by digestion using a restriction endonuclease that cuts or fails to cut when the variant allele is present  additionally realtime pcr such as the allele specific kinetic realtime pcr assay can be used or allele specific realtime taqman probes  for allelespecific pcr primers are used which hybridize at their ′ ends to a particular target genetic locus or mutation if the particular polymorphism or mutation is not present an amplification product is not observed amplification refractory mutation system arms can also be used as disclosed in european patent application publication no  insertions and deletions of genes can also be detected by cloning sequencing and amplification in addition restriction fragment length polymorphism rflp probes for the gene or surrounding marker genes can be used to score alteration of an allele or an insertion in a polymorphic fragment such a method is particularly useful for screening relatives of an affected individual for the presence of the mutation found in that individual other techniques for detecting insertions and deletions as known in the art can be used  in sscp dgge and the rnase protection assay an electrophoretic band appears which is absent if the polymorphism or mutation is not present sscp detects a band which migrates differentially because the sequence change causes a difference in singlestrand intramolecular base pairing rnase protection involves cleavage of the mutant polynucleotide into two or more smaller fragments dgge detects differences in migration rates of mutant sequences compared to wildtype sequences using a denaturing gradient gel in an allelespecific oligonucleotide assay an oligonucleotide is designed which detects a specific sequence and the assay is performed by detecting the presence or absence of a hybridization signal in the muts assay the protein binds only to sequences that contain a nucleotide mismatch in a heteroduplex between mutant and wildtype sequences  mismatches according to the present invention are hybridized nucleic acid duplexes in which the two strands are not  complementary lack of total homology may be due to deletions insertions inversions or substitutions mismatch detection can be used to detect point mutations in the gene or in its mrna product while these techniques are less sensitive than sequencing they are simpler to perform on a large number of samples an example of a mismatch cleavage technique is the rnase protection method in the practice of the present invention the method involves the use of a labeled riboprobe which is complementary to the human wildtype genes ie such as those listed in table  the riboprobe and either mrna or dna isolated from the person are annealed hybridized together and subsequently digested with the enzyme rnase a which is able to detect some mismatches in a duplex rna structure if a mismatch is detected by rnase a it cleaves at the site of the mismatch thus when the annealed rna preparation is separated on an electrophoretic gel matrix if a mismatch has been detected and cleaved by rnase a an rna product will be seen which is smaller than the full length duplex rna for the riboprobe and the mrna or dna the riboprobe need not be the full length of the mrna or gene but can be a segment of either if the riboprobe comprises only a segment of the mrna or gene it will be desirable to use a number of these probes to screen the whole mrna sequence for mismatches  in similar fashion dna probes can be used to detect mismatches through enzymatic or chemical cleavage see for example cotton et al proc natl acad sci usa  shenk et al proc natl acad sci usa   novack et al proc natl acad sci usa   alternatively mismatches can be detected by shifts in the electrophoretic mobility of mismatched duplexes relative to matched duplexes see for example cariello am j human genetics   with either riboprobes or dna probes the cellular mrna or dna which might contain a mutation can be amplified using pcr see below before hybridization changes in dna of the associated genetic polymorphisms or genetic loci can also be detected using southern blot hybridization especially if the changes are gross rearrangements such as deletions and insertions  dna sequences of the drd dtnbp gabra dat comt rgs kpna akt htra prodh ankk disc and grm genes which have been amplified by use of pcr may also be screened using allelespecific probes these probes are nucleic acid oligomers each of which contains a region of the gene sequence harboring a known mutation for example one oligomer may be from about three to about  nucleotides in length such as                                                                                                   an oligomer of about  nucleotides in length is particularly convenient these oligomers correspond to a portion of the gene sequence by use of a battery of such allelespecific probes pcr amplification products can be screened to identify the presence of a previously identified mutation in the gene hybridization of allelespecific probes with amplified target gene sequences can be performed for example on a nylon filter hybridization to a particular probe under high stringency hybridization conditions indicates the presence of the same mutation in the tissue as in the allelespecific probe  once the site containing the polymorphisms has been amplified the snps can also be detected by primer extension here a primer is annealed immediately adjacent to the variant site and the ′ end is extended a single base pair by incubation with dideoxytrinucleotides whether the extended base was a a t g or c can then be determined by mass spectrometry malditof or fluorescent flow cytometric analysis taylor et al biotechniques   or other techniques  nucleic acid analysis via microchip technology is also applicable to the present invention in this technique thousands of distinct oligonucleotide probes are built up in an array on a silicon chip nucleic acids to be analyzed are fluorescently labeled and hybridized to the probes on the chip it is also possible to study nucleic acidprotein interactions using these nucleic acid microchips using this technique one can determine the presence of mutations or even sequence the nucleic acid being analyzed or one can measure expression levels of a gene of interest the method is one of parallel processing of many including thousands of probes at once and can tremendously increase the rate of analysis  the most definitive test for mutations in the target loci is to directly compare genomic sequences from patients with those from a control population alternatively one can sequence mrna after amplification eg by pcr thereby eliminating the necessity of determining the exon structure of the candidate gene  mutations falling outside the coding region of the target loci can be detected by examining the noncoding regions such as introns and regulatory sequences near or within the genes an early indication that mutations in noncoding regions are important may come from northern blot experiments that reveal messenger rna molecules of abnormal size or abundance in patients as compared to those of control individuals  alteration of mrna expression from the genetic loci can be detected by any techniques known in the art these include northern blot analysis pcr amplification and rnase protection diminished mrna expression indicates an alteration of the wildtype gene it is worth noting that the drd ct polymorphism has been shown to increase mrna stability in vitro duan et al hum mol genet   and that this could result in a detectable change in steadystate drd mrna levels in vivo alteration of wildtype genes can also be detected by screening for alteration of wildtype protein for example monoclonal antibodies immunoreactive with a target protein ie a protein encoded by a gene in table  or two or more proteins from the genes in table  or  can be used to screen a tissue lack of cognate antigen or a reduction in the levels of antigen would indicate a mutation antibodies specific for products of mutant alleles could also be used to detect mutant gene product such immunological assays can be done in any convenient formats known in the art these include western blots immunohistochemical assays and elisa assays any means for detecting an altered protein can be used to detect alteration of the wildtype protein functional assays such as protein binding determinations can be used in addition assays can be used which detect the protein biochemical function finding a mutant gene product indicates alteration of a wildtype gene product  hence the present invention further extends to a method for identifying a genetic basis behind diagnosing or treating a neurological psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or state in an individual said method comprising obtaining a biological sample from said individual and detecting a protein encoded by a nucleotide sequence having from about one to about  polymorphisms in one or more genes listed in table  including their ′ or ′ terminal region promoter intron or exons with a statistical significant association with a particular neurological psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or state resulting in from about one to about  amino acid insertions substitutions or deletions wherein the presence of an altered amino acid sequence is indicative of the presence of a polymorphism and the likelihood of a neurological psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or psychological condition phenotype or state  the altered amino acid sequence may be detected via specific antibodies which can discriminate between the presence or absence of an amino acid change by amino acid sequencing by a change in protein activity or cell phenotype andor via the presence of particular metabolites if the protein is associated with a biochemical pathway  a mutant gene or corresponding gene products can also be detected in other human body samples which contain dna such as serum stool urine and sputum the same techniques discussed above for detection of mutant genes or gene products in tissues can be applied to other body samples by screening such body samples an early diagnosis can be achieved for subjects at risk of developing a particular neurological psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or state or subthreshold forms thereof  primer pairs disclosed herein are useful for determination of the nucleotide sequence of a particular target gene using pcr the pairs of singlestranded dna primers can be annealed to sequences within or surrounding the gene in order to prime amplifying dna synthesis of the gene itself a complete set of these primers allows synthesis of all of the nucleotides of the gene coding sequences ie the exons the set of primers preferably allows synthesis of both intron and exon sequences allelespecific primers can also be used such primers anneal only to particular polymorphic or mutant alleles and thus will only amplify a product in the presence of the polymorphic or mutant allele as a template  in order to facilitate subsequent cloning of amplified sequences primers may have restriction enzyme site sequences appended to their ′ ends thus all nucleotides of the primers are derived from the gene sequence or sequences adjacent the gene except for the few nucleotides necessary to form a restriction enzyme site such enzymes and sites are well known in the art the primers themselves can be synthesized using techniques which are well known in the art generally the primers can be made using oligonucleotide synthesizing machines which are commercially available given the sequence of each gene and polymorphisms described herein design of particular primers is well within the skill of the art the present invention adds to this by presenting data on the intronexon boundaries thereby allowing one to design primers to amplify and sequence all of the exonic regions completely  the nucleic acid probes provided by the present invention are useful for a number of purposes they can be used in southern blot hybridization to genomic dna and in the rnase protection method for detecting point mutations already discussed above the probes can be used to detect pcr amplification products they may also be used to detect mismatches in the target genes or mrna using other techniques  the present invention identifies the presence of altered or mutant genetic loci associated with a neurological psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or state including schizophrenia or a subthreshold form thereof or an individual of risk of developing same in order to detect a target genes or mutation a biological sample is prepared and analyzed for a difference between the sequence of the allele being analyzed and the sequence of the “wildtype” allele in this context a “wildtype” allele includes the nucleotide at a given position most commonly represented in the population and for which there is not direct evidence for these individuals having the neurological psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or state under investigation polymorphic or mutant alleles can be initially identified by any of the techniques described above the polymorphic or mutant alleles may then be sequenced to identify the specific polymorphism or mutation of the particular allele alternatively polymorphic or mutant alleles can be initially identified by identifying polymorphic or mutant altered proteins using conventional techniques the polymorphisms or mutations especially those statistically associated with a neurological psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or state or a subthreshold form thereof are then used for the diagnostic and prognostic methods of the present invention  as used herein the phrase “amplifying” refers to increasing the content of a specific genetic region of interest within a sample the amplification of the genetic region of interest may be performed using any method of amplification known to those of skill in the relevant art in a preferred aspect the present method for detecting a polymorphism utilizes pcr as the amplification step  pcr amplification utilizes primers to amplify a genetic region of interest reference herein to a “primer” is not to be taken as any limitation to structure size or function reference to primers herein includes reference to a sequence of deoxyribonucleotides comprising at least three nucleotides generally the primers comprises from about three to about  nucleotides preferably from about five to about  nucleotides and even more preferably from about  to about  nucleotides such as                                                                                                  or  nucleotides the primers of the present invention may be synthetically produced by for example the stepwise addition of nucleotides or may be fragments parts or portions or extension products of other nucleic acid molecules the term “primer” is used in its most general sense to include any length of nucleotides which when used for amplification purposes can provide free ′ hydroxyl group for the initiation of dna synthesis by a dna polymerase dna synthesis results in the extension of the primer to produce a primer

about three to about  consecutive nucleotides from the gene or its corresponding cdna or mrna as listed in table  such as the groups of two or more genes in table  which encompass at least one

containing the gene of interest a suitable annealing temperature must be determined determination of an annealing temperature is based primarily on the genetic makeup of the primer ie the number of a t c and gs and the length of the primer annealing temperatures contemplated by the methods of the present invention are from about ° c to about ° c preferably from about ° c to about ° c and more preferably about ° c such as                                         or ° c  the pcr amplifications performed in the methods of the present invention include the use of mgcl in the optimization of the

nucleotide sequences are aligned with substantial complementarity but at least one base aligns to a base which would result in an “abnormal” binding pair an abnormal binding pair occurs when thymine t

detect the presence of alleles from the genes from table  or combination of two or more genes in table  predisposing an individual to an inability to overcome a neurological psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or state or subthreshold form thereof or a risk of developing same a biological sample such as blood is obtained and analyzed for the presence or absence of a panel of susceptibility alleles comprising from about one to  alleles of the genetic loci identified as being statistically significantly associated with the neurological psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or state of interest results of these tests and interpretive information are returned to the health care provider for communication to the tested individual such diagnoses may be performed by diagnostic laboratories or alternatively diagnostic kits are manufactured and sold to health care providers or to private individuals for selfdiagnosis suitable diagnostic techniques include those described herein as well as those described in us pat nos   and   according to the present invention a method is also provided for supplying wildtype genes as listed in tables  or  to a cell which carries a mutant or polymorphism supplying such a function should allow normal functioning of the recipient cells the wildtype gene or a part of the gene may be introduced into the cell in a vector such that the gene remains extrachromosomal in such a situation the gene will be expressed by the cell from the extrachromosomal location more preferred is the situation where the wildtype gene or a part thereof is introduced into the mutant cell in such a way that it recombines with the endogenous mutant gene present in the cell such recombination requires a double recombination event which results in the correction of the gene mutation vectors for introduction of genes both for recombination and for extrachromosomal maintenance are known in the art and any suitable vector may be used methods for introducing dna into cells such as electroporation calcium phosphate coprecipitation and viral transduction are known in the art and the choice of method is within the competence of the practitioner conventional methods are employed including those described in us pat nos   and   the identification of the association between a gene polymorphismmutation and a psychological phenotype or subthreshold psychological phenotype permits the early presymptomatic screening of individuals to identify those at risk for developing a neurological psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or state or subthreshold neurological psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or state such as schizophrenia or to identify the cause of such disorders or the risk that any individual will develop same to identify such individuals the alleles are screened as described herein or using conventional techniques including but not limited to one of the following methods fluorescent in situ hybridization fish direct dna sequencing pfge analysis southern blot analysis single stranded conformation analysis sscp linkage analysis rnase protection assay allelespecific oligonucleotide aso dot blot analysis and pcrsscp analysis also useful is the recently developed technique of dna microchip technology such techniques are described in us pat nos   and  each

overcome a neurological psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or state or a subthreshold form thereof after initial treatment for particular at risk couples embryos or fetuses may be tested after conception to determine the genetic likelihood of the offspring being predisposed to the neurological psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or state certain behavioral or therapeutic protocols may then be introduced from birth or early childhood to reduce the risk of the neurological psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or state developing presymptomatic diagnosis will enable better treatment of these disorders including the use of existing medical therapies genetic testing will also enable practitioners to identify individuals having diagnosed disorders or in an at risk group which have polymorphism identified in the genetic loci genotyping of such individuals will be useful for a identifying neurological psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or state or a subthreshold form thereof that will respond to drugs affecting gene product activity b identifying a neurological psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or state or subthreshold neurological psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or state that in an individual which respond well to specific medications or medication types with fewer adverse effects and c guide new drug discovery and testing  further the present invention provides a method for screening drug candidates to identify molecules useful for treating neurological psychiatric or psychological conditions phenotypes or states involving the gene or its expression product drug screening is performed by comparing the activity of native genes and those described herein in the presence and absence of potential drugs in particular these drugs may have the affect of masking a polymorphism or mutation or may bind to a particular polymorphism or mutation enabling it to be used as a diagnostic agent the terms “drug” “agent” “therapeutic molecule” “prophylactic molecule” “medicament” “candidate molecule” or “active ingredient” may be used interchangeable in describing this aspect of the present invention  the goal of rational drug design is to produce structural analogs of biologically active polypeptides of interest or of small molecules with which they interact eg agonists antagonists inhibitors in order to fashion drugs which are for example more active or stable forms of the polypeptide or which eg enhance or interfere with the function of a polypeptide in vivo or which are specific for a targetable eg a polymorphism and hence is a useful diagnostic several approaches for use in rational drug design include analysis of threedimensional structure alanine scans molecular modeling and use of antiid antibodies these techniques are well known to those skilled in the art including those described in us pat nos   and   a substance identified as a modulator of polypeptide function may be peptide or nonpeptide in nature nonpeptide “small molecules” are often preferred for many in vivo pharmaceutical uses accordingly a mimetic or mimic of the substance particularly if a peptide may be designed for pharmaceutical use  the designing of mimetics to a known pharmaceutically active compound is a known approach to the development of pharmaceuticals based on a “lead” compound this approach might be desirable where the active compound is difficult or expensive to synthesize or where it is unsuitable for a particular method of administration eg pure peptides are unsuitable active agents for oral compositions as they tend to be quickly degraded by proteases in the alimentary canal mimetic design synthesis and testing are generally used to avoid randomly screening large numbers of molecules for a target property  once the pharmacophore has been found its structure is modelled according to its physical properties eg stereochemistry bonding size andor charge using data from a range of sources eg spectroscopic techniques xray diffraction data and nmr computational analysis similarity mapping which models the charge andor volume of a pharmacophore rather than the bonding between atoms and other techniques can be used in this modeling process a template molecule is then selected onto which chemical groups that mimic the pharmacophore can be grafted the template molecule and the chemical groups grafted thereon can be conveniently selected so that the mimetic is easy to synthesize is likely to be pharmacologically acceptable and does not degrade in vivo while retaining the biological activity of the lead compound alternatively where the mimetic is peptidebased further stability can be achieved by cyclizing the peptide increasing its rigidity the mimetic or mimetics found by this approach can then be screened to see whether they have the target property or to what extent it is exhibited further optimization or modification can then be carried out to arrive at one or more final mimetics for in vivo or clinical testing  briefly a method of screening for a substance which modulates activity of a polypeptide may include contacting one or more test substances with the polypeptide in a suitable reaction medium testing the activity of the treated polypeptide and comparing that activity with the activity of the polypeptide in comparable reaction medium untreated with the test substance or substances a difference in activity between the treated and untreated polypeptides is indicative of a modulating effect of the relevant test substance or substances  following identification of a substance which modulates or affects gene or gene product activity the substance may be further investigated furthermore it may be manufactured andor used in preparation ie a manufacture or formulation or a composition such as a medicament pharmaceutical composition or drug these may be administered to individuals directly or via gene therapy  the expression products of the genes in table  or  antibodies peptides and nucleic acids of the present invention can be formulated in pharmaceutical compositions which are prepared according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques see for example remingtons pharmaceutical sciences th ed  mack publishing co easton pa the composition may contain the active agent or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the active agent these compositions may comprise in addition to one of the active substances a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient carrier buffer stabilizer or other materials well known in the art such materials should be nontoxic and should not interfere with the efficacy of the active ingredient the carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration eg intravenous oral intrathecal epineural or parenteral  the present invention provides information necessary for medical practitioners to select drugs for use in the treatment of a neurological psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or state or a subthreshold form thereof with the identification that polymorphisms within a panel of genes are associated with a neurological psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or state including a subthreshold form thereof such as schizophrenia antipsychotic medications can be selected for the treatment of such conditions  the present invention further contemplates a method of treating a neurological psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or state in an individual the method comprising identifying from about one to about  polymorphisms in a gene selected from table  or a panel of genes selected from two or more genes in table  with the neurological psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or state and subjecting the individual to gene therapy to alter the gene or genetic sequence having a different polymorphism or to treat the defect caused by the polymorphism or to subject the individual to behavioral modification protocols to help ameliorate the symptoms  another aspect of the present invention provides a method a method for determining the likelihood of a subject responding favorably to a particular drug in the treatment of a neurological psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or state said method comprising obtaining or extracting a dna sample from cells of said individual and screening for or otherwise detecting the presence of from about one to about  polymorphisms in one or more genes listed in table  including their ′ or ′ terminal region promoter intron or exons which with a statistical significant association with a particular neurological psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or state wherein the presence of the polymorphism profile is indicative of the likelihood of the drug being effective  using the compositions of the present invention gene therapy may be recommended when a particular polymorphism conferring for example a disease condition or a propensity for development of neurological psychiatric or psychological condition phenotype or state is identified in an embryo genetically modified stem cells may then be used to alter the genotype of the developing cells where an embryo has developed into a fetus or for postnatal subjects localized gene therapy may still be accomplished alternatively a compound may be identified which effectively masks a particular undesired polymorphic variant or which influences the expression of a more desired phenotype for example one polymorphic variant of a receptor may result in an instability of the mrna transition product  accordingly the present invention also provides genetic test kits which allow the rapid screening of a polymorphism or polymorphisms within a test sample or multiple test samples the kits of the present invention comprise one or more sets of primers as described herein which are specific for the amplification of a genetic region of interest in addition the genetic testing kits of the present invention provide a pcr mix comprising mgcl in a preferred aspect the mgcl is provided at a concentration of  mm additionally the genetic test kits of the present invention provide instructions for using the primers of the present invention to obtain the desired duplexes as well as instructions as to the analysis of the duplexes using dhplc the test kits may also contain instructions for use  in essence the identification of a panel of polymorphisms in one or more genes as listed in table  or  or a subset allows a clinician to confirm behavioral characteristics or provide a diagnosis of schizophrenia again reference to the panel in table  or  includes all genes listed in tables  andor  or combination of two or more genes  therapeutic kits are also contemplated by the present invention for example the kit may comprise a diagnostic or polymorphism detection component and a selection of therapeutics the choice of use of which is dependent on the outcome of the diagnostic assay  the present invention is further described with reference to the following nonlimiting examples example  selection of patients  the clinical data pertaining to schizophrenia patients are comprehensive and allow for the appraisal of specific phenotypic groups based on symptoms history or response to medication patients were being treated at the fortitude valley community mental health centre the royal brisbane mental health unit and the park psychiatric hospital each in brisbane australia inclusion criteria were being between  and  years of age and having a dsm iv diagnosis of schizophrenia in this particular study potential participants were excluded if they had schizoaffective

polymorphisms snps the speed and accuracy of matrixassisted laser desorptionionization timeofflight mass spectrometry malditof ms offers a solution for highthroughput genotyping the hme assay is based on the annealing of an oligonucleotide primer hme primer adjacent to the snp of interest the addition of a dna polymerase along with a mixture of terminator nucleotides allows extension of the hme primer through the polymorphic site and generates allelespecific extension products each having a unique molecular mass the resultant masses of the extension products are then analyzed by malditof ms and a genotype is assigned in real time performing multiple pcr and hme reactions in a single well multiplexing is a way to further increase the throughput and reduce cost per genotype sequenom has optimized individual reagent concentrations and thermal cycling conditions to multiplex pcr and hme reactions for best malditofmsbased genotyping results  a list of primers used is shown in table

a total of  snps were analyzed for association with schizophrenia this followed identification of genes and a total of  snps that had been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia from the literature these snps were then genotyped as described in example  some snps failed to amplify some were monomorphic in our populations while a small number upon scrutiny gave results that were inconsistent with expectation these snps were removed from further analysis  the remaining snps were analysed for association using chi square tests as described however it was expected that some snps found to be associated with schizophrenia would also be associated with each other that is once the genotype of one snp was known a knowledge of the genotype of a second snp would not significantly add to the ability to diagnose schizophrenia even though the second snp was also associated with schizophrenia  thus the intention was to identify the smallest set of snps that would give the greatest discriminating ability between control and schizophrenic individuals to achieve this two different methods were used binary logistic regression and discriminant function analysis both methods build a model in which snps are sequentially added based on the extent and significance of association with schizophrenia the most associated snp is added first than the most associated snp independent of the first added snp then the most associated snp independent of the first two added snps and so on no more snps are added to the list once the addition of new snps does not significantly improve the discriminating ability of the model  one problem with the use of these methods is that missing data render calculations impossible obviously when investigating  individuals for  snps there were many instances of missing data to overcome the problem of missing data the method of “imputation of missing values” was used donders et al j clin epidemiol   burd et al j trauma   van der heijden et al j clin epidemiol   specifically for each snp the distribution of genotype frequencies was calculated for controls and schizophrenics these frequencies were then used to generate a total of  “virtual” genotypes with identical genotypefrequency distributions to the original control and schizophrenic populations then for each missing genotype a virtual genotype was imputed to the data set that was randomly selected from the  virtual genotypes of the relevant snp and schizophreniacontrol designation  once the imputations had been done binary logistic regression and discriminant function analysis could be performed and a panel of snps generated that best predicted the schizophreniacontrol status of individuals to avoid any stochastic biases due to the imputation method the process was repeated  times and the final panel of snps was selected on the basis of consistency of inclusion in the  generated models for each of the binary logistic regression and discriminant function analysis methods  table  lists the genes of interest and or a combination of snps listed in table  lists the panel so far selected to best test for schizophrenia example  linkage disequilibrium analysis  linkage disequilibrium ld describes a situation in which some combinations of alleles or genetic markers occur more or less frequently in a population than would be expected from a random formation of haplotypes ld is an important factor to examining association for disease susceptibility loci this data describes the snps that are associated with schizophrenia that display ld the identification of snps displaying ld explains the inclusionexclusion of individual snps that are included in the discriminant analysis and logistic regression models  the jlin software package was used to generate ld values carter et al bmc bioinformatics    results of linkage disequilibrium analysis are shown in table   table  list   linkage disequilibrium analysis  d     dmin  −

use of inhibitors of the cytokinedependent activation of the jak kinase prior to cytokine stimnltion cellular jak kinase is present in an inactivated state inhibitors of jak kinase activation may be identified by their ability to inhibit the conversion of the jak kinase into its catalytically active state which can be ltctd by in vitro kinase assay as described below and in the examplesas discuvelcd by the present ilv  jak kinases are activated by their cytokineinlucel tyrosine phosphorylation accordingly inhibitors may also be identified according to the invention as those compounds or peptides which block or sinifirntly reduce the cytokineinrlnced tyrosine phosphorylation of the jak kinase into its catalytically active form the state of tyrosine phosphorylation of a jak kinase following cytokine stimnltinn may be assayed for example by the ability of the jak kinase to be rletctel with an antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodyactivation of a jak kinase by a particular cytokine may require the physical association of the jak kinase with the lclor for that cytokine see example  according to the invention peptide antagonists mimirling those portions of the jak kinase or cytokine receptor involved in this association are useful as inhibitors of jak kinase activation these peptides are col lated by the invention to act as inhibitors by associating with either the cytokine receptor for the jak kinase peptides or    pctuss the jak kinase for the cytokine eceol peptides thus blocking the ocition of the jak kinase with the cytokine lcclorin particular the invention teaches that jak activation by epoluilcs the physical association of jak with the epo cellr epor and that this socition requires a lenrdle proximal region of eporthat is es l for mitogenesis

with a baculovirus vector capable of etssig the jak kinase at high levels jak kinase produced in this way has been found to be catalytically active and useful in in vitro kinase wo    pctus assays it is expected that other jak kinases produced in large amonnt in insect cells in a similar lllael will also be catalytically activea catalytically active jak kinase may also be obtained from cells clyig

to incllfrient amounts of a jak kinase e present invention provides for enhancing this response by increasing the levels of the jak kinase in the cell see example  this situation could be due to mutations which reduce the amount of the jak kinase produced by the cell to subnormal levels this situation could also be due to mutations which reduce the rate or degree of cytokineinlucel jak activation such that the level of jak kinase produced by the cell does not provide sufficient levels of activated jak kinase following cytokine indlrtionthe levels of jak kinase may be increased in a

in vitro kinase activity although jakl apcal to weakly wo s  g  pctus associate with epor and is weakly tyrosine phosphorylated following epostim tionthe plhllaly substrate of tyrosine phosphorylation in the in vitro reactions was jak and specifically no phosphorylation of the s i globulin heavy chain was letect this shows that jak may have very specific substrate specificities regarding the mçh i of jak activation it is possible that ligand binding promotes jak csocition such that intermolecular phosphorylations occur and result in the activation of kinase activity activated jak then has the ability to continue such interrnolecular phosphorylations in vitro in immllnreeipils in a manner that is completely analogous to the receptor protein tyrosine kinases ohtsuka et al mol cell biol   yarden and sr s cl biochemistry  epo stimllltion results in the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the epor receptor with kintirs that are comparable to that of the tyrosine phosphorylation of jak this

phosphorylation does not occur in col ig a  amino acid deletion in the membrane proximal region or with the w to r mutation in this region since both of these mutations also affect jak phosphorylation and kinase activation and the amino acid delotion  s the ability of jak to ccocit with epor in vitro it is likely that jak is the kinase responsible for epor phosphorylation lively another kinase may ccocit with jak and thereby be brought into the region of the receptor if so this additional kinase may also be required for the phosphorylation of jakwith the exception of jak and epor relatively

the ability to physically eocite with jakit is likely that the point mutation is sffirient to disrupt a functional interrtion of epor and jak in vivo but does not s fflriently lower the affinity of

this possibility also exists for epor in particular since jak is ubiquitously expressed the binding fflnitios of thelor have not been neaud in the absence of jak moreover as j   pctlusslo demollsllald

witthuhn et al cell  based on the role of the box  and box  regions in association of other receptors with jaks we would hypothesie that jak associates with the il rector  chain experiments are

ilil inlucestat like poleins are members of the stat family and co ilule specific substrates of jak nevertheless it can be hypoth io that cytokine in cecl activation of jaks and stats may be a very

associated  kda proteintyrosine kinase activitv is also associated with lifr in the absence of cntf although the  kda protein is either not present or not inific ntly phosphorylated in the absence of the factor other experiments showing that this in vitro kinase activity has the same selilivily to urosolille as that observed upon addition of cntf to intact cells suggested that this associated lylosille kinase activity is relevant to that which is required in the cell to p t cntfin red responses fu llllore the  kda protein appears   g  pctus to be a good cntlidte for this kinase since lysis of the cells in np does not give coplrifiti n of either the  kda protein or tyrosine kinase activity not shown cntp and rpte pactors induce tyrosine phosphorylation of s jakl jak and tyk experiments using specific antisel raised against portions of jakl jak or tyk reveal that all  of these kinases can become tyrosine phosphorylated following stim tion by cntf lif osm and il figure  la shows that

phosphorylation of tyk and jakl without aalll change in the phosphorylation status of jak osm treated skmes cells reveal tyrosine phosphorylation of primarily jak with smaller changes in tyk and jaklin each of these cases tyrosine phosphorylation of the jaks or tyk is associated with an increase in their in vitro tyrosine kinase activity not shown these results stand in contrast to previous results showing that stimntion with gmcsf eeo gcsf ifny or il only result in iyiusine phosphorylation of jak argetsinger et al cell  silvennoinen et al proc natl acad sci usa in press  witthuhn et al cell   we conclude from these experiments that the cntf family of factors can activate jakl jak and tyk although there is some variability in which jaktyk family member is activated in a particular cell wos   usthe jaks associate with cntf b receptor components transient  çeelions in cos cells were used to determine whether the jaks could associate with the  célol co ulllll in the absence of factors these e lents used carboxyl l lly epitopetagged versions of lifr contining the  amino acid portion of cmyc that is recognized by the monoclonal antibody e davis et al science   coscells were colidlrecled with plopridte eression vectors encoding full length versions of lifr and jakl or jak and brij  lysates were immllnnprecipitated with e and then blotted with the antisera against either jakl or jak figure  these experiments show that either jak can associate with lifrb in the absence of any added ligand furthermore a iirtd version of lifr which retains only the first  amino acids of the cytoplasmic domain is fully capable of binding to jakl and jak as well this implicates the membrane proximal region of lifrb as the jak binding domin which is co enl with the homology beween is region of the receptor with those in gpl and epor that have been shown to be required  for signal trnc rtion upon factor binding mllrkmi et al science   witthuhn et al cell   cotransfection with reptor components and jaks results in ligand induced functional response further èe lents in cos cells were undertaken to establish whether cotransfection of the receptor components with the jaks could reconstruct a ligandin ced functional re e epitopetagged gplflag and il were chosen for these e ents since gpl homodimerizes and becomes iylu e phosphorylated in response to il  soluble ilrx obviating the need for collalrelion with lifrb murakami et al proc natl acad sciusa   davis et al science  following stim tion with il  silra neither mock transfected lane           pctus nor gplflag llalrcclcd cos cells lanes  revealed subsllial tyrosine phosphorylation of gpl following i  precipitation with antiflag and aptyr immnnoblotting figure  in contmst coi relion with either jakl lanes  jak lanes  or both jakl and jak lanes  gives rises to a substantial increase in the inlured tyrosine phosphorylation of gpl upon stimllltion with il  silra dilssin altogether these results inlicte that the jaks can associate with the cntf receptor b components and become tyrosine phosphorylated in response to cntf lif il or osm with concomitant activation of the tyrosine kinase this most likely occurs through transphosphorylation as ligandinlnced hetero or homodimerization of the b components brings their bound jaks into close apposition stahl and yancopoulos cell   the filnrtionl reconstruction in cos cells of ligandin ed tyrosine phosphorylation of gpl upon coliarlion with either jakl or jak is co with the notion that jakl jak or tyk can function as the first kinases activated inside the cell upon eceplor l subunit dimerization thus placing the jak family of kinases as the most proximal intracellular step in n g signal trnluction of the cntf family of factors all
