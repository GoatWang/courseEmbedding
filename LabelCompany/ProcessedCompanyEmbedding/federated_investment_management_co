investment management company recommends reorganization of closedend funds and tender offer news provided by federated investors inc jun    et share this article pittsburgh june   prnewswire  federated investment management company the investment advisor to federated premier intermediate municipal income fund nyse fpt and federated premier municipal income fund nyse fmn today announced that it recommended to the boards of trustees of fpt and fmn and the boards of trustees approved that fpt reorganize into fmn with fmn being the surviving fund  the reorganization which requires shareholder approval is expected to be a taxfree transaction completed during the fourth quarter of   federated investment management company also has recommended to the board of trustees of fpt and the board of trustees has approved fpt conducting a tender offer for up to  percent of its outstanding common shares at a price equal to  percent of net asset value at the close of trading on the date the tender offer expires  this tender offer would be completed prior to the reorganization of fpt into fmn  the specific dates for fpts tender offer will be announced separately but it is currently anticipated that the tender offer will commence in july  and end in august   additional terms and conditions of fpts tender offer will be set forth in its offering materials which will be distributed to its common shareholders  should the number of common shares tendered and not withdrawn exceed  percent of fpts outstanding common shares fpt will purchase common shares from tendering common shareholders on a pro rata basis  accordingly common shareholders cannot be assured that fpt will purchase all of their tendered common shares following the tender offer if shareholders approve the reorganization fpt would reorganize into fmn  it is currently anticipated that if the tender offer is completed by the end of august  that the reorganization may be completed by the end of november   the two funds have identical investment objectives and substantially similar investment strategies focused on taxexempt municipal bonds with fpts portfolio having an intermediate duration that is currently shorter than the duration of fmns portfolio  fmn invests in longterm taxexempt municipal bonds as it seeks to provide its shareholders current income through a variety of market cycles federated investment management company reached an agreement with fpts largest shareholder to support the reorganization of fpt pursuant to which that shareholder has withdrawn the shareholder proposal and nominations it had previously submitted to fpt fpts largest shareholder also has agreed to certain customary standstill provisions until the termination of the agreement federated investment management company believes the tender offer and subsequent reorganization are in the best interest of fpt and its shareholders as well as fmn and its shareholders  the tender offer would provide some liquidity to fpt common shareholders seeking it and the reorganization of fpt into fmn would provide fpt shareholders continuing to seek taxexempt income the option to pursue that investment strategy through a leveraged closedend fund  the reorganization would afford fmn shareholders the opportunity to continue their investment in a long duration taxexempt municipal closedend fund with larger assets and attractive portfolio characteristics such as broader yieldcurve diversity federated investors inc nyse fii is one of the largest investment managers in the united states

parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
