instrumental in the advancement of many important new technologies including innovative treatments for glaucoma the catalyst award glaucoma research foundations highest honor recognizes exemplary leadership in sustaining innovative glaucoma research and education the award was presented to dr link on february   at the glaucoma  annual gala in san francisco video transcript gene de juan jr md founder and vice chairman forsight labs somebody would think that you were exaggerating when you say bill has been very much a part of most of the important innovations that have happened over the past really fifteen twenty years in ophthalmology but he really has done tremendous been involved or initiated efforts that have really changed ophthalmology all of the very sophisticated laser treatments for refraction the second sight bionic eye all of that he really has had a huge impact emmett cunningham jr md phd mph partner clarus ventures and hes done so much of it over such a long period of time so  years directly involved in companies that have innovated at the highest levels  amo chiron vision then a series of private companies that he started and helped start helped build and take to the point where they had successful medical devices within ophthalmology gene an innovator is somebody who changes the world and he doesnt have to be an inventor maybe steve jobs with the iphone is an innovation because it changed the world it changed the way we act and i call those innovations and i think what bill does is he takes inventions and turns them into innovations that change the way people act i dont think the catalyst award could go to somebody who has been more impactful emmett in what way does bill exemplify the word catalyst i think that he and what he does which is venture investing really at its core is what promotes and fuels innovation promotes company growth company building so both the money he provides and the expertise he provides allows these companies permits them to grow to flourish so in that sense i think hes a real catalyst for innovation title catalyst for innovation william j link phd managing director versant ventures i transitioned into venture capital in the late s after we sold a business that i had helped build named chiron vision to bausch  lomb i had been a ceo and entrepreneur for over  years and i was ready to do something different and a colleague of mine a dear friend invited me to look at the venture capital field i didnt know what it was and i was intrigued and thought i would give it a try and since when i started in venture capital i knew a lot about ophthalmology i probably was able to see opportunity there because of my expertise title innovator in ophthalmology bill link well i got started in ophthalmology by accident my wife marsha and i left indiana university where we were both on the faculty and we moved to southern california and i got into the business side of the world first day on the job i was just sitting in a conference room trying to be quiet at the far end of the table and the boss at the end of the table said does anyone here know about these new lenses that are implanted inside the eye theyre called intraocular lenses it was dead quiet and after a couple moments i couldnt stand it and i said well mr perry i dont know about those lenses but i know an ophthalmologist and that started my career in ophthalmology title what makes bill tick bill link well how important is family is an easy thought for me family is everything there are a lot of ways to do well and feel good about yourself but my way is to know that the family is solid and that ive done my part i was raised in a caring family it made a difference in my life i believe that im involved now with a family that i know i care about and we care about each other and so if were healthy and interactive and go through our ups and downs as a family thats a strong base and can be a platform for us trying this professionally trying that professionally and we can always go back to the family who accepts us as we are well of course theres a lot more to come i couldnt be more fired up then i am today the privilege i have is my ability to have impact has never been better and so shame on me if we dont stay focused and look forward and try to continue to take on tough problems team up with good people and good clinicians and i bet were going to continue to make a difference title entrepreneur innovator catalyst william j link phd the  catalyst award end transcript last reviewed on september   was
