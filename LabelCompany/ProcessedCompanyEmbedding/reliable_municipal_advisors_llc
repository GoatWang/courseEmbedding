interest a good source for general business news  us based an interesting real estate investment resource qa on davis bacon published by aflciodavisbacon qapdf adobe acrobat document  mb did you know there is a taxpayer bill of rightstaxpayer bill of rightspdf adobe acrobat document  kb why you need a financial advisor if you are a borrower eligible to take advantage of lower costing taxexempt debt did you know there are now laws that may affect the depth of the advice your broker dealerinvestment banker may give to you   in the past many borrowers have depended on ideas suggestions and related advice services from public finance bankers outside of an underwriting engagement new rules effective july   limit the ability of investment bankers to provide such assistance outside an underwriting engagement  and it may even limit some of the advice they can give you even while engaged   you should further note that the law requires an engaged underwriter to disclose to a municipal borrower that they may have interests adverse to their own this conflict of interest was the basis for why in year  jon roberts formed roberts consulting llc it took a 8 world economic financial meltdown for the lawmakers to review and acknowledge this conflict and then it took nearly  years more to implement rules in an attempt to address it      please remember this roberts consulting llc is a registered municipal advisor   in july  the doddfrank act included a provision that the securities and exchange commission sec and municipal securities rulemaking board msrb regulate nondealer municipal advisors ma   if you have someone soliciting you and providing ideas as to how to structure a taxexempt bond issue for your particular needs and circumstances  then they are likely undertaking a municipal advisory activity if they are not registered with the sec and msrb as an ma they may be violating the law   if your broker dealer renders advice particular to your needs outside an underwriting engagement provided the transaction you execute utilizes that advice it would preclude that investment bank from acting as your underwriter however provided they are registered as an ma they can continue to work as your advisor   the secs general definition of advice under the ma rules is advice includes without limitation a recommendation that is particularized to the specific needs objectives or circumstances of a municipal entity or obligated person with respect to municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal securities including with respect to the structure timing terms and other similar matters concerning such financial products or issues based on all the facts and circumstances   for the typical roberts consulting llc client all of whom are not  “municipal entities” read the above sec definition of advice using the following understandings   obligated persons means a borrower  responsible for the repayment of municipal security indebtedness could be a 5c a forprofit developer entity an owner of a manufacturing facility etc and   municipal financial products means products or services such as the reinvestment of bond proceeds the use of interest rate derivatives swaps and caps plus other products that are often tied or linked to the needs of issuingusing municipal security indebtedness   the secs rules provide broker dealers with three narrowlydefined exemptions where advice may be given without being considered a municipal advisor if the broker dealer is contractually engaged to serve as the borrowers underwriter  if the borrower already has an independent registered municipal advisor and if the broker dealer is responding to a request for proposal rfp  the law does not provide a way for a borrower to agree with an underwriter to opt out from the applicability of these rules   how do you know if you want to hire a broker dealer without knowing if they intend to or even can offer the financing solution best suited to your needs the devil is in the details  and they are not without engagement allowed to provide those details   if you opt for the rfp exception how do you know all the right questions or providers to ask if you dont fully understand the array of products and services that might be available to you the markets are forever changing and the products and services keep developing to address those changes   the problem is that what you dont know  and what you may not ask  can result in a higher costing andor less than an optimally structured financing today you are subject to increasingly more complicated products and structural choices meanwhile new regulations are serving to stymie traditional resources to learning which product or service could or would be of particular interest to you the result is that the use of a financial advisor registered municipal advisor is even more essential than it has ever been   you should ask your advisor if they are a registered ma roberts consulting is not a registered ma by choice the law made us register we are   long before the laws existed  a financial advisor because we know borrowers of taxexempt finance need a fair impartial voice they can trust a voice that comes in the absence of material conflicts of interest a voice of experience and one possessing the expertise they will learn to know they can
