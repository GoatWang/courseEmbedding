facebook twitter google artist biography by richie unterberger as producer richard robinsons main credential is doing lou reeds first solo album and generally aiding reed in making the transition from exvelvet underground leader to solo star at the beginning of the s robinson was hardly the kind of industry vet one might have assumed would qualify for work with an artist of reeds stature he had done records for the flamin groovies and hackamore brick both cultish backtobasics bands that drew huzzahs from some rock critics and have in retrospect been lauded by some writers as vague antecedents of new wave as the groups ran counter to the more psychedelic and progressive trends of the day at the time however they were just littleknown bands and lps and reed actually was not too famous himself the velvet underground having sold few records and their international cult having yet to develop into the monster it eventually became robinson had also been involved in other media working as a rock writer for go magazine and doing a radio show on new yorks wnew with his wife and fellow rock writer lisa robinson and lenny kaye he started the music magazine rock scene one of the less seriousminded rock publications of the s richard meltzer once wrote that lisa robinson would throw parties for reed with the purpose of ingratiating the robinson couple with the singersongwriter and then getting him on the comeback trail as a solo artist with richard robinson as producer it was a groupielike situation but the benefits did run both ways reed was in a state of lethargy not doing much of anything for months after leaving the velvet underground in  and needed some motivation to rebuild his musical career as a soloist and richard robinson did get to coproduce with reed reeds first album lou reed in london for rca in  the record however was underproduced and did not get the most out of the material which included leftovers from the velvet underground era that had not made it onto the velvets four studio lps such as lisa says i cant stand it walk and talk it and ocean oddly supporting musicians on the album included rick wakeman and steve howe of yes as well as veteran british session drummer clem cattini for his next album reed let robinson loose and worked with david bowie resulting in the much more successful transformer the irascible reed was not done with robinson however and worked with him again on street hassle one of the performers better lates albums robinsons most notable other production jobs were of the flamin groovies teenage head and david johansens first solo album richard and lisa robinson were active throughout the s as rock writers and general scenemakers in the new york rock world as of  richard robinson was marketing magic

l e  robinson richard b phd associate dean for graduate affairs professor of pharmacology in the center for molecular therapeutics regulation of cardiac ion channels and autonomic signaling by development and disease gene and cell therapies for cardiac arrhythmias office prebyterian hospital  w  telephone  fax  emailrbrcolumbiaedu current research my laboratory is concerned with elucidating the processes that control developmental regulation of cardiac ion channel expression ie electrical behavior and cardiac autonomic responsiveness ie sensitivity to neurotransmitters and using that knowledge to design gene and cellbased therapies for cardiac disease we study heart cells grown alone in culture or cocultured with neurons or mesenchymal stem cells we employ a range of techniques including standard electrophysiology whole cell voltage clamp and fluorescence microscopy with ion sensitive dyes by studying both native cardiac channels and recombinant channels overexpressed in myocytes we explore the molecular mechanisms that control channel function within the heart cell and the impact of development and disease on these mechanisms we also take advantage of transgenic animals in which selected signaling elements have been disrupted or altered we have identified agedependent differences in the function and expression of several cardiac ionic channels including ina ical and if and also differences in autonomic signal transduction cascades including alpha and betaadrenergic and cholinergic that modulate these and other ionic channels in the heart we have further found that neurons exert a trophic influence to modify heart cell development that can account for some of the agedependent effects on ion channel function and the cardiac cells response to autonomic agonists both neurally released peptides eg npy and more familiar neurotransmitters eg norepinephrine can serve as developmental factors our increasing understanding of the factors that regulate channel function within the heart cell allows us to develop genetic therapies in which selected channels are overexpressed in the in situ heart either within the myocytes or in stem cells that then couple to the myocytes for the purpose of regulating cardiac rhythm recent efforts in this regard have resulted in proofofconcept studies creating a biological pacemaker to augment or replace current electronic pacemakers and enhancing conduction to disrupt reentrant arrhythmias associated with myocardial infarction httpwwwcumccolumbiaedudeptcmtparticipantsbiosrobinsonshtml selected publications
