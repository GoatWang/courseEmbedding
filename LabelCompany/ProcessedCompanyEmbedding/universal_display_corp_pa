any proceeds from the resale of the shares of common stock by motorola the industry in which we operate is highly competitive we compete against alternative flat panel display technologies in particular lcds as well as other oled technologies we also compete against other lighting technologies in particular inorganic leds flat panel display industry competitors numerous domestic and foreign companies have developed or are developing lcd plasma and other flat panel display technologies that compete with our oled display technologies we believe that oled display technologies ultimately can compete with lcds and other display technologies for many product applications on the basis of lower power consumption better contrast ratios faster video rates and lower manufacturing cost however other companies may succeed in continuing to improve these competing display technologies or in developing new display technologies that are superior to oled display technologies in various respects we cannot predict the timing or extent to which such improvements or developments may occur lighting industry competitors traditional incandescent bulbs and fluorescent lamps are wellentrenched products in the lighting industry in addition compact fluorescent lamps and solidstate leds have recently been introduced into the market and would compete with oled lighting products having attributes different than fluorescent lamps and leds oleds might not compete directly with these products for all lighting applications however manufacturers of leds and compact fluorescent lamps may succeed in more broadly adapting their products to various lighting applications or others may develop competing solidstate lighting technologies that are superior to oleds again we cannot predict whether or when this might occur oled technology and materials competitors eastman kodak company has licensed its competing fluorescent oled technology and other patents to a number of display manufacturers several of whom are presently manufacturing oled products another oled industry participant cambridge display technology ltd licenses its competing polymer oled technology and recently entered into a joint venture with sumitomo chemical company to develop polymer oled materials many display manufacturers themselves are engaged in research development and commercialization activities with respect to oled technologies and materials in addition other manufacturers of oled materials such as idemitsu kosan co ltd are selling products that compete with our proprietary pholed materials our existing business relationships with samsung sdi and other product manufacturers suggest that our oled technologies and materials particularly our pholed technologies and materials may achieve some level of market penetration in the flat panel display and lighting industries however our competitors may succeed in improving their competing oled technologies and materials so as to render them superior to ours we cannot be sure of the extent to which product manufacturers ultimately will adopt our oled technologies and materials for the production of commercial flat panel displays and lighting products company description we are a leader in the research development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode or oled technologies and materials oleds are thin lightweight and powerefficient solidstate devices highly suitable for use in fullcolor displays and as lighting products we believe oled displays will capture a share of the growing flat panel display market because they offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to brightness power efficiency viewing angle video response time and manufacturing cost we also believe that oled lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high efficiency excellent color rendering index low heat generation and novel form factors our technology leadership and intellectual property position should enable us to share in the revenues from oled displays and lighting products as they enter mainstream consumer markets our primary business strategy is to further develop and license our proprietary oled technologies to manufacturers of products for display applications such as cell phones mp players laptop computers and televisions and specialty and general lighting products in support of this objective we also develop new oled materials and sell those materials to product manufacturers through our internal research and development efforts and our relationships with worldclass partners such as princeton university the university of southern california the university of michigan motorola inc and ppg industries inc we have established a significant portfolio of proprietary oled technologies and materials we currently own exclusively license or have the sole right to sublicense more than  patents issued and pending worldwide in  three manufacturers purchased our proprietary oled materials for use in commercial oled display products samsung sdi co ltd of south korea au optronics corporation of taiwan and tohoku pioneer corporation of japan we also have entered into a patent license agreement with samsung sdi under which we expect to soon start receiving royalties based on samsung sdi’s commencement of sales of active matrix oled display products in addition we are working with many other companies who are evaluating our oled technologies and materials for possible use in commercial oled display and lighting products including seiko epson corporation konica minolta technology center inc and sony corporation our corporation was organized under the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania in april  our business was commenced in june  by a company then known as universal display corporation which had been incorporated under the laws of the state of new jersey on june   a whollyowned subsidiary of
