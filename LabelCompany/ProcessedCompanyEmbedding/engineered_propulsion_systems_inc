pagetemplatedefaultpagepageidpagechildparentpageidajaxfadepagenotloaded fuel economy the eps graflight v has demonstrated the highest fuel efficiency of any general aviation engine  this is illustrated in figure  which shows the hourly fuel cost as a function of horsepower for  different general aviation engines these engines fit into three distinct categories   avgas engines as shown by the solid and dashed black curves which require the abrupt increase in fuel consumption at  horsepower in order to prevent destructive detonation and preignition turboprop engines as shown by the single dotted black curve diesel engines as shown in the remaining  colored curves   the diesel engines show considerably better fuel efficiency than the other two categories the eps graflight v is the best of the best as shown in the solid blue curve which demonstrates  better fuel efficiency than the  other diesels this blue curve is the actual measured fuel efficiency of the graflight v which maintains its leadership over the competition throughout a remarkably wide operating range from 0 to 0 horsepower   as an example of what this data means to the end user it is worth comparing the continental tsio0e avgas engine to the eps graflight v diesel operating at  of the full 0 horsepower which is  horsepower at this power the continental hourly fuel cost is hr but the eps graflight v is only hr for a hr savings   figure  shows the hourly fuel costs chart for the higher fuel costs found in germany at  power of  horsepower the continental hourly fuel cost is hr but the eps graflight

pagetemplatedefaultpagepageidpageparentajaxfadepagenotloaded engine overview overviewthe eps advantage the graflight v engine employs an electronic control system designed and manufactured by industry leader bosch general aviation technology to dramatically reduce pilot workload and ensure efficiency and ease of operation the engine is controlled with a single power lever leaving traditional pilot chores like propeller pitch fuel mixture and controlling engine temperature to the computer reducing the risk of pilot error the engine is designed with extremely rugged technologies like steel pistons and cgi iron crankcases that provide superior strength and durability over aluminum without sacrificing weight this reduces maintenance costs significantly by increasing the targeted time between overhauls tbo to  hours a 0 to 0 percent increase over the industry’s current values of  to  hours   with its lowprofile compact design the graflight v is suited for single and twinengine aircraft its meticulous craftsmanship and specially patented features also make it capable of working with composite and aluminum propellers a unique feature that attests to the extraordinarily low vibration generated at even the highest power in addition the graflight v has the advantage of running on a variety of heavy fuels including jet a jp or straight diesel making it viable for use not only in ga aircraft and small helicopters but also in military drones small boats or troop carriers   this is the engine that will redefine flying making it faster cleaner and less costly the eps engine has the potential to open new markets around the world where avgas has never been available but jet fuel is in abundant supply places like china africa and south america airplanes equipped with the graflight v can choose to carry more payload or fly farther on the same amount of fuel either way the savings over the life of the engine will more than pay for itself this is eps a revolution in flight  hours tbo   i’ve been following the eps progress since its inception trusting the engineering and manufacturing prowess of the principles to achieve the desired result…after watching the development of the mechanical part of the engine coupled with world renowned bosch orchestrating the engine controller my confidence is high for success  as an airframe designer and industry insider i have nothing but praises for the effort to date thomas s hamilton president aerocet inc and designer of the kodiak aircraft     carry more fly longer fly faster fly cleaner…anywhere on the planet carry more the unprecedented performance of the eps engine means pilots have the luxury of adding more payload while still achieving extraordinary fuel savings   in the case of the cirrus sr for example that translates into the equivalent of two additional passengers flying the same distance as with a continental gasoline  horsepower engine while still realizing a 0 percent reduction in fuel cost fly longer the superior fuel economy of the eps engine naturally gives pilots tremendous range flexibility  you can carry more and still fly much farther than with a traditional gasoline engine which has the disadvantage of vastly higher fuel flow rates and also requires additional fuel be diverted to help cool the engine when operating above  percent maximum power   because diesels use a liquid cooling system they do not have this same requirement  and because the eps engine uses the most modern automotive diesel technology to date in a specially designed package for general aviation its fuel efficiency outperforms every engine currently on the market   a look at fuel flow rates that compare the eps engine with the lycoming 0 horsepower gasoline engine and the rolls royce turbine engine make the point  the eps engine shows considerably lower gallons per hour compared to the others  the two right columns show the fuel savings for the eps engine in pounds per hour pph  the need to have excess cooling fuel flow above  percent power is also evident in the lycoming gasoline engine fuel burn   fly faster the graflight v gives you the freedom to fly much faster because of its design and efficiency first because of its remarkably low fuel consumption you don’t need to carry as much fuel to cover the same distance and this opens up a whole new realm of piloting options the engine also is not limited by the avgas characteristics that allows leaning at or below  percent power but requires running full rich at extreme fuel flows for higher powers above  percent to prevent preignition and detonation the eps engine fuel flow is steady throughout its entire power range so powering the engine above  percent is no issue piloting the plane at higher power or lower power has little effect on fuel efficiency and being a watercooled engine the graflight v can easily handle the higher powers to make the airplane cruise faster if that is the pilot’s desire this option means freedom of choice fly faster or fly further it’s entirely up to you fly cleaner diesels emit less carbon monoxide hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide emissions that some scientists believe lead to global warming  it also takes less refining to produce the jet fuel that diesels use compared with the leaded gasoline that traditional aero engines use that’s one reason jeta fuel costs less than avgas   the switch to alternative fuels is also critical because the us environmental protection agency and various environmental groups are actively trying to eliminate avgas because it contains tetra ethyl lead a known carcinogen  cars were forced to remove this additive in the 90s and were quickly converted to run on “unleaded” fuel but the aviation industry has escaped that mandate – until now the epa has publicly stated that avgas will be outlawed before this decade is over and the faa is actively seeking replacement fuels an engine with the ability to run on a variety of heavy fuels clearly has an advantage in this uncertain future   read more   fly anywhere on the planet the eps engine runs on fuels that are readily available at airports around the world  this will open new markets for eps customers who will now be able to sell aircraft into asia africa and south america where there is little or no avgas but where ample supplies of diesel or jeta exist to serve commercial aviation   europe and china have seen growth in their market segments of 0 percent and  percent respectively  china’s demand for ga aircraft is expected to grow by  to  piston airplanes in the next decade as their airspace is opened for civilian use  to put this figure into perspective china’s deman for ga aircraft will grow at a rate that demands more new airplanes than are currently produced in our mature us market  their marketplace demands a jetfueled alternative since they do not intend to implement an avgas infrastructure   eps  our history   eps  our history 9 pagetemplatedefaultpagepageid9pagechildparentpageidajaxfadepagenotloaded our history imagine what the automotive industry would be like today if it relied on the same motors that came out of detroit in the 90s – engines without electronic fuel injection computerized control and monitoring systems or cgi cylinder blocks imagine the inefficiency the pollution and the maintenance hassles shockingly that is exactly what general aviation continues to rely on antiquated dirty gasguzzling power plants that have remained virtually unchanged for half a century   despite great advancements in airframe design propellers avionics and safety systems the very backbone of the industry is woefully outdated new engines are needed to carry this industry into the future – modern engines that are more efficient more costeffective more maintenance and pilot friendly and more environmentally responsible   fulfilling this dire need was the opportunity of a lifetime for engine designers michael fuchs and steven weinzierl having successfully launched numerous engine designs into fullscale production in the automotive and motorsport industries the two men knew firsthand what it would take for a similar launch in the aviation arena with more than 0 years design experience between them and a keen interest in flying from their childhood days they had a thorough understanding of the cutting edge technology needed to bring general aviation into the st century what’s more as they surveyed the industry early in 0 they found no competition for their expertise   while others clearly recognized the industry’s dilemma their answers to modernization amounted to mere modifications of existing car motors – tweaks to diesel engines that were then stuffed inside airplanes as if a motor that once drove four wheels could now drive a prop just as efficiently “it was ludicrous” recalls eps president michael fuchs who helped design the diesel powerhouse behind the ford super duty light pickup truck and couldn’t fathom why anyone would take an engine like that and use it to power a plane   fuchs and his fellow engine designer and eps vice president steven weinzierl believed strongly that airplane engines begged to be rethought from the ground up building on  stateoftheart clean diesel technology “no one was looking at this problem and asking what they could do if they started fresh” recalls weinzierl “and that was crazy considering the decades of advances we’ve had in engineering in electronics in manufacturing in computeraided modeling for engine designers like us this was a dream we just had to pursue”   the challenge was also a road to freedom in the automotive industry no matter how talented or creative you are designs are ultimately hampered by a noose of regulations and that noose is getting tighter all the time engine designs are highly constrained  and ironically the result is an inefficient automobile engine designed to meet government requirements in aviation the regulatory environment is nowhere near as strict so mr fuchs and mr weinzierl finally had the opportunity that is every engineer’s dream to build the most efficient engine imaginable and more efficiency means less waste such an engine could not only be more powerful and economical but also “greener” than anything aviation had ever seen this was an irresistible chance for two long time engine designers to test their mettle and see just what their knowledge imagination and talent could accomplish once freed from arbitrary constraints   confident they could radically redesign the airplane engine and revolutionize the ga market the two designers quit their jobs in  to form engineered propulsion systems eps intent on setting a new standard for propellerdriven airplanes working with a small handpicked team of topnotch engineers they spent the next four years rethinking every aspect of the typical engine and crafted an entirely new design patenting a number of unique advancements along the way unlike the competition this new motor was reconfigured specifically for airplane installation and was designed to optimize propeller rotation extracting every ounce of efficiency while greatly increasing ease of pilot operation innovation aviation and manufacturing are the key strengths in wisconsin and eps is working on all three governor scott walker – wisconsin   to ensure production quality and keep costs competitive they decided early on that they would manufacture the new engine inhouse in 0 with the proofofconcept design complete they began lining up manufacturing suppliers and production partners including bosch general aviation technology a subsidiary of robert bosch gmbh “it was paramount that we control the process from beginning to end” explained fuchs “everything has to be done precisely according to specifications you simply cannot rely on outsiders over whom you have no control to produce these parts successfully every engine company understands this”   because of their unique approach the eps engine is like nothing the aviation world has ever seen it boasts the best fuel economy of any general aviation engine on the market because it takes advantage of modern european diesel engine rd it not only burns the green environmentallysound fuel that consumers are demanding but it reduces fuel costs by more than 0 percent over some gasoline engines this translates into a more than 0 percent increase in mission range while costs per payload pound are cut by half or more   the graflight v engine boasts more than 0 horsepower yet it is lightweight rugged compact and quiet it takes full advantage of electronic engine management and monitoring systems that significantly reduce pilot workload and chance for pilot error these systems also stretch maintenance times to an unprecedented  hours tbo significantly cutting maintenance and repair costs over the life of the motor the precise savings the graflight v provides will ultimately depend on its usage but there is no arguing the fact that it offers extraordinary advantages over today’s standard engines it will save significantly on fuel and maintenance it is cleaner and greener for the environment and it will increase the intrinsic value of any airplane by enhancing payload capacity   for pilots that means a whole new flying experience with unprecedented ease of operations a new standard of reliability durability and safety and the freedom to fly further or faster in this remarkable new design for those who are concerned about the future of our planet it means a faster path to eliminating the leaded avgas fuel that virtually all general aviation aircraft are using in the united states and europe today and it means that airplanes will be flying more efficiently and thus more cleanly than ever before in history and for those looking to ensure that manufacturing stays strong in america it is worth noting that while a small fraction of parts will be manufactured overseas the majority of this engine will be built at the firm’s headquarters in new richmond wisconsin keeping jobs and growing business for workers right here in the usa
