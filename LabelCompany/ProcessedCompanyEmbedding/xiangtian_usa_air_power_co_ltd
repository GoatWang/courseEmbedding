shares of common stock reincorporation in nevada we reincorporated in nevada effective october   as a result of a merger of xiangtian usa air power co ltd a delaware corporation with its whollyowned subsidiary xiangtian usa air power co ltd a nevada corporation note   basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america this basis of accounting involves the application of accrual accounting and consequently revenues and gains are recognized when earned and expenses and losses are recognized when incurred the companys consolidated financial statements are expressed in us dollars use of estimates and assumptions the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period actual results could differ from those estimates interim financial statements the accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap applicable to interim financial information and the requirements of form q and rule  of regulation sx of the securities and exchange commission accordingly they do not include all of the information and disclosure required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america for complete financial statements interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year in the opinion of management all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods have been included these interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended july   as not all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles for annual financial statements are presented the interim financial statements follow the same accounting policies and methods of computations as the audited financial statements for the year ended july   these interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended july   as not all

period presentation these reclassifications had no effect on reported net income or losses principle of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company its subsidiaries and vie for which it is deemed the primary beneficiary all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation the company evaluates the need to consolidate its vie in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support the vie agreement was not consummated until july   however the purpose and design of the establishment of vie sanhe was to consolidate common control under the company asc f states that a reporting entitys involvement in the design of a vie may indicate that the reporting entity had the opportunity and the incentive to establish arrangements that result in the reporting entity being the variable interest holder with the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance as both the company and the acquired vie sanhe are under the common control of zhou dengrong and zhou jian immediately before and after the acquisition this transaction was accounted for as a merger under common control using merger accounting as if the merger had been consummated at the beginning of the earliest period presented and no gain or loss was recognized all the assets and liabilities of the vie sanhe are recorded at carrying value hence sanhe was consolidated under the company since its inception due to the purpose and design of its establishment the following financial statement amounts and balances of the vie which is established on august   were included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of january   and july   and for the three months ended january   and  respectively

measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements asc  also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability asc  establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value asc  establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows        level  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets        level  inputs to the valuation methodology includes quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instruments        level  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value there were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis subject to the disclosure requirements of asc  as of january   and july   cash and cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market cost is principally determined using the weighted average basis construction costs incurred on contracts are included in inventories which consist of raw materials accessory parts and contracts work in progress property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation

years   vehicle    years   property under capital lease    years   revenue recognition sales of power generation system in conjunction of system installation are recognized under accounting for constructiontype contracts based on the nature of the contract using the completedcontract method the reason for selecting completedcontract method is a the companys contract is duration is less than one year and financial position and results of operations would not vary materially from those resulting from use of the percentageof completion method b reasonably dependable estimate cannot be made due to nature of contracts accordingly revenue is recognized upon the completion of the construction provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists title and risk of loss has transferred the fee is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured we provide for any loss that we expect to incur on these contracts when that loss is probable percentageof completion method for contracts with long duration and it is practical to make reasonable estimate percentageof completion method is used revenue is recognized based on the percentage of total income the percentage is based on incurred costs to date bearing to estimate total cost after giving effect to estimates of cost to complete based on most recent information we provide for any loss that we expect to incur on these contracts when that loss is probable warranty and returns the company generally provides limited warranties for work performed under its contracts the warranty periods typically extend for a limited duration following substantial completion of the companys work on a project at the time a sale is recognized we record estimated future warranty costs such estimated costs for warranties are included in the individual project cost estimates for purposes of accounting for longterm contracts generally the estimated claim rates of warranty are based on actual warranty experience or companys best estimate no right of return exists on sales of equipment replacement part returns are estimable and accrued at the time a sale is recognized value added taxes the company is subject to vat at a rate of  on proceeds received from customers and are entitled to a refund for vat already paid or borne on the goods purchased by it that have generated the gross sales proceeds the vat balance is recorded in other payables on the balance sheets income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach which allows for the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years under the asset and liability approach deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before the company is able to realize their benefits or that future deductibility is uncertain  under asc  a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination with a tax examination being presumed to occur the evaluation of a tax position is a twostep process the first step is to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including the resolution of any related appeals or litigations based on the technical merits of that position the second step is to measure a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot threshold to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements a tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than  percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement tax positions that previously failed to meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent period in which the threshold is met previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the morelikelythannot criteria should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is no longer met penalties and interest incurred related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the year incurred no significant penalties or interest relating to income taxes have been incurred during the period from july   inception to december   us gaap

july  the fasb issued asu no  simplifying the measurement of inventory which modifies existing requirements regarding measuring inventory at the lower of cost or market under existing standards the market amount requires consideration of replacement cost net realizable value nrv and nrv less an approximately normal profit margin the new asu replaces market with nrv defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation this eliminates the need to determine and consider replacement cost or nrv less an approximately normal profit margin when measuring inventory the amendments are effective for the annual period ending after december   and for annual and interim periods thereafter early application is permitted the company is currently assessing this asus impacts on the companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition in august  the financial accounting standards board issued asu no  presentation of financial statements going concern subtopic  this standard is intended to define managements responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures the amendments contained in this asu apply to all companies and notforprofit organizations the amendments are effective for the annual period ending after december   and for annual and interim periods thereafter early application is permitted the company is currently assessing this asus impact on the companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition the company believes that there were no other accounting standards recently issued that had or are expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations note   going concern the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern the company has incurred losses since its inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of  as of january   and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern the ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the company generating profitable operations in the future andor obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due these consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern  the company expects to finance operations primarily through cash flow from revenue and capital contributions from principal shareholders in the event that we require additional funding to finance the growth of the companys current and expected future operations as well as to achieve our strategic objectives our principal shareholders have indicated the intent and ability to provide additional equity financing these conditions raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern the companys continuation as a going concern is dependent on our ability to meet obligations as they become due and to obtain additional equity or alternative financing required to fund operations until sufficient sources of recurring revenues can be generated there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in its plans described above or in attracting equity or alternative financing on acceptable terms or if at all the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty note   inventories inventories consist of the following     january      july                    unaudited

september  the processing project in shandong is expected to be completed in april  we are dependent on these projects for all our projected revenue until we obtain additional customers and any material delay or reduction in the projected cash receipts will adversely affect our operations while we expect to generate revenue on the completion of our projects to meet the liquidity and capital resources of our operations delayed receipts may cause going concern issues  we expect to finance operations from progress billings from ongoing projects and through noninterest bearing loans from the companys directors we estimate that our cash and cash equivalents and projected cash receipts from operations are sufficient to fund operations for the next six months however additional funds may be required given our continued losses from operations additional funding may come from equity financing from the sale of our common stock or from borrowings but there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms if we are successful in completing an equity financing existing shareholders will experience dilution of their interest in our company the company has incurred losses since its inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of  as of january   and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern the ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the company generating profitable operations in the future andor obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due our future financial results are also uncertain due to a number of factors some of which are outside our control these risk factors include but are not limited to    our ability to raise additional funding          the results of our proposed operations going concern

offbalance sheet arrangements we have no offbalance sheet arrangements including arrangements that would affect our liquidity capital resources market risk support and credit risk support or other benefits critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates and assumptions the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period actual results could differ from those estimates  fair value measurements the company applies the provisions of asc subtopic  fair value measurements for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements asc  also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability asc  establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value asc  establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows            level  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets            level  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instruments            level  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value there were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis subject to the disclosure requirements of asc  as of january   and july   billings in excess of costs billings in excess of costs is comprised of cash

fee is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured we provide for any loss that we expect to incur on these contracts when that loss is probable  warranty and returns the company generally provides limited warranties for work performed under its contracts the warranty periods typically extend for a limited duration following substantial completion of the companys work on a project at the time a sale is recognized we record estimated future warranty costs such estimated costs for warranties are included in the individual project cost estimates for purposes of accounting for longterm contracts the warranty cost is estimated based on our experience with the type of work and any known risks relative to the project and was not material during the periods ended january   and july   no right of return exists on sales of equipment replacement part returns are estimable and accrued at the time a sale is recognized recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu no  simplifying the measurement of inventory which modifies existing requirements regarding measuring inventory at the lower of cost or market under existing standards the market amount requires consideration of replacement cost net realizable value nrv and nrv less an approximately normal profit margin the new asu replaces market with nrv defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation this eliminates the need to determine and consider replacement cost or nrv less an approximately normal profit margin when measuring inventory the amendments are effective for the annual period ending after december   and for annual and interim periods thereafter early application is permitted the company is currently assessing this asus impacts on the companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition in february  the fasb issued asu no  consolidation topic  amendments to the consolidation analysis the new consolidation standard changes the way reporting enterprises evaluate whether a they should consolidate limited partnerships and similar entities b fees paid to a decision maker or service provider are variable interests in a vie and c variable interests in a vie held by related parties of the reporting enterprise require the reporting enterprise to consolidate the vie the guidance is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after december   early adoption is allowed including early adoption in an interim period a reporting entity may apply a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulativeeffect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption or may apply the amendments retrospectively the company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements in august  the fasb issued asu no  presentation of financial statements going concern subtopic  this standard is intended to define managements responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entitys ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures the amendments contained in this asu apply to all companies and notforprofit organizations the amendments are effective for the annual period ending after december   and for annual and interim periods thereafter early application is permitted the company is currently assessing this asus impact on the companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition in may  the fasb issued asu no  revenue from contracts with customers which provides a single comprehensive model to be used in the accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance including industryspecific guidance the standards stated core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services to achieve this core principle the asu includes provisions within a five step model that includes identifying the contract with a customer identifying the performance obligations in the contract determining the transaction price allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations and recognizing revenue when or as an entity satisfies a performance obligation the standard also specifies the accounting for some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and requires expanded disclosures about revenue recognition the standard provides for either full retrospective adoption or a modified retrospective adoption by which it is applied only to the most current period presented this asu is effective january   the company is currently assessing this asus impact on the companys consolidated results of operations and financial condition  the company believes that there were no other accounting standards recently issued that had or are expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations item   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk while our reporting currency is the us dollar almost all of our consolidated revenues and consolidated costs and expenses are denominated in rmb all of our assets are denominated in rmb except for some cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivables as a result we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between us dollar and rmb the rmb has recently depreciated against the us dollar and if the rmb depreciates further against the us dollar the value of our rmb revenues earnings and assets as expressed in our us dollar financial statements will decline we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange risk inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the costs of our products and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results inflation in china has recently increased substantially the inflation rate in china was reported at approximately  percent for  and  for see httpwwwstatistacomstatisticsinflationrateinchina these factors have led to the adoption by the chinese government of various corrective measures designed to restrict the availability of credit or regulate growth and contain inflation price inflation can affect our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling and distribution general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if we are unable to pass along raw material price increases to customers accordingly inflation in china may weaken our competitiveness domestically or in international markets item  controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures the term disclosure controls and procedures defined
