biographycassell bryanlow cassellbryanlow google cassellbryanlowwsjcom dec  9  pm et london hedgefund manager tony chedraoui has set chins wagging for the second time in the past two months chedraoui who previously ran deephaven capital management’s european event fund made noise when he raised more than  million for the launch of his own fund in mid october–making it one of the world’s largest hedgefund launches this year associated press less than two months later the yearold is again the hot topic of conversation in the hedgefund community after french conglomerate vivendi disclosed tuesday that it was buying a large stake in brazilian telecommunications operator gvt holding from chedraoui’s fund called tyrus capital llp vivendi said it was purchasing from tyrus shares corresponding to  of gvt valued at about  million or  brazilian reals a share that got fellow fund managers talking about how chedraoui had appeared to bet the house on one stock–a practically unheard of move in an industry that typically seeks to diversify risk tyrus owned a  stake in gvt according to a disclosure by the hedge fund on nov  the remainder was exposure to gvt stock via call options which gives the owner the right to purchase the underlying shares at a certain price but only require a fraction of the full share price as a result tyrus’s exposure to gvt was less than the entire value of its fund though still a significant position hedge funds have been closely following events at gvt which has been the subject of a monthslong bidding war after vivendi in september offered  reals a share for the brazilian company the following month spanish telecommunications operator telefonica topped that bid by offering  reals a share later raising its price to  reals in early november with the shares trading in the low  reals at the time some investors considered there to be limited downside to buying the stock and potential upside given the competitive nature of the bidding vivendi then trumped telefonica’s with an offer of  reals with more money having come over the transom since the launch the lebanonborn chedraoui has more than  billion in assets under

awards tyrus capital february   most consistent eventdriven hedge fund   company tyrus capitalname tony chedraoui 9 was only a year after the global financial crisis sent shockwaves throughout the corporate landscape however it was during this period that tyrus capital launched their flagship fund the tyrus capital event fund with bn making it the biggest hedge fund launch of the year we spoke to tony chedraoui cio and founder of tyrus capital about how the business thrived during these turbulent times and what his plans are for the future tyrus capital started ‘day one’ with  employees who had previously worked closely with chedraoui in his capacity as global head of eventdriven strategies at deephaven the tyrus capital event fund is a continuation of the deephaven european event fund and what helped make it so successful according to chedraoui “was that the deephaven european event fund generated returns of more than  for investors in  while importantly retaining the portfolio’s high liquidity structure” achieving such impressive results in the height of an economic downturn  unsurprisingly  led to strong interest from many investorsthe tyrus capital event fund looks to generate attractive riskadjusted returns through an equity based eventdriven strategy with an emphasis on announced deals in developed markets the fund seeks to implement an investment strategy that is not dependent on the general economic environment but to produce returns that are correlated to specific event trades rather than to broader markets and therefore the fund tends to be less impacted by major volatility moves the team’s focus is on portfolio construction in order to try to avoid the fund being affected by dislocation in tough markets and aims to build a portfolio that limits downside risk whilst creating upside optionality linked either to a specific event or to a more general theme chedraoui explains that as cio he has overall responsibility for portfolio construction “i typically structure the portfolio with a limited number of positions at any point in time to enable the team to monitor the portfolio closely and to limit correlation within it i use daily proprietary reports to monitor and analyse various risk factors and tools created by the firm to spot trends and stock movements the portfolio management system provides numerous risk monitoring tools including the ability to stress test the portfolio on a regular basis stop loss limits are used where deemed appropriate and liquidity of individual positions is monitored which helps to ensure that exposure levels can be increased or reduced rapidly typically we use minimal leverage”when discussing the tyrus capital event fund chedraoui firmly believes that structured trades are unique to the firm and set the team apart from many other eventdriven specialists by offering upside optionality while protecting the downside risks and remaining liquid “in particular we seek to capture upside optionality from mispriced companies that boast a global franchise but are tarred with a peripheral european valuation both the analysis and negotiation for these trades rely heavily on the firm’s internal legal specialists who have built up considerable experience over the years we have closed over  of these transactions since  and i believe that we have never lost money on any”each of the individuals involved in the investment process brings an important set of skills to the team and to the review of potential opportunities detailed knowledge gained from experience in corporate finance investment banking law regulation derivatives and equity and debt investing ensures that the team is able to assess and structure trades that are designed to meet the required criteria today tyrus capital has  employees across offices in monaco and london and is probably the largest equity eventdriven fund in europe with an aum of c bn the tyrus capital event fund has a proven independent track record of over  years and a team that has worked together for a number of years on both the investment and business side which chedraoui believes is “key to our success” “in addition at tyrus capital we offer coinvestment opportunities to existing investors in the tyrus capital funds allowing them to potentially enhance their returns from their relationship with the firm and we have a private equity secondaries fund targeting asymmetric riskreturn opportunities in pe with limited downside targeting attractive secondary pereturns but with a much shorter investment horizon” says chedraouichedraoui has always believed in investing in the firm’s operational infrastructure and as a result tyrus capital has built a toptier award winning institutional business platform which has impressed many operational due diligence experts mark madden coo and his team set out from launch to deliver an infrastructure which not only gives the investment team all the relevant capabilities that they need but that is also robust enough to survive almost any realistic business continuity event the team uses its intellectual capital to build proprietary systems around the traditional vendor portfolio management systems to provide automated reconciliation tools these create alerts enabling the operations team to focus on exceptions trade breaks and operational risks in real time while screenbased dashboards give the transparency needed to monitor every relevant aspect of the business including the it and operational infrastructure “this is something that is constantly evolving and improving at tyrus capital with a high level of investment in this infrastructure” says chedraouion his hiring plans chedraoui says “tyrus capital hires very selectively looking for individuals with commitment hunger for success motivation a positive attitude good ethics expertise in a specific area and a thrill for excellence who above all are good team players”“i am continuing to build out the investment team based on my conviction that investment banking skills offer a critical advantage when analysing announced deals therefore we generally hire people who have worked in investment banking and who are known to us for a long time  most of them will also have had experience of working in wellestablished funds in keeping with my focus on legal analysis and determination to build a robust compliance framework i have added further lawyers to both the business and investment teams and tyrus capital now counts no fewer than  lawyers among its  staff”when asked what his philosophy would be for choosing funds to invest in chedraoui says he would look for the following attributes·    a proven track record·    no significant negative performance years·    no large drawdowns·    capital commitments from key employees·    team continuity low staff turnover·    willingness to build a partnership with investors over the long term    looking forward into  and beyond chedraoui says “my focus this year will remain on the tyrus capital event fund and on continuing to produce attractive risk adjusted returns for our investors whilst building out the team further we will maintain the pace of development of our state of the art it technology – it is our ambition to set a new level of excellence in the industry in this area  on the client side we will further our strategy of seeking select investors to partner with over the long term investors who are looking for exposure to a differentiated product including structured trades which we believe that we provide”“tyrus capital will continue to place a strong emphasis on maintaining a high quality business with best in class operational infrastructure risk management systems client service and a commitment to ethical standards and to a culture of compliance to complement its differentiated investment activities” wells blogduis mollis est non commodo luctus nisi erat porttitor ligula eget lacinia odio sem nec elit maecenas
