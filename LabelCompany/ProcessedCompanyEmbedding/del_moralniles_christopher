please enter your email address subject comments like many a financial institution associated banccorp parent of associated bank committed mistakes during the mortgage boom — like parachuting loan officers into hot housing markets thousands of miles away to grow a construction loan book by the end of  of course the folly was evident the bank’s nonperforming loans hit  billion a year later associated had gross writeoffs of  million fortunately though in the upper midwest the core of associated’s market delinquency and foreclosure rates stayed below banking industry and national averages allowing the green bay wisconsinbased institution to maintain a sufficient capital cushion christopher del moralnilescfo associated banccorp now four years after his arrival as treasurer of associated banccorp christopher del moralniles paints a portrait of a bank that has recovered nicely total loans rose  and a total deposits  in the first nine months of  and net interest income increased  in addition the bank’s loantodeposit ratio is back near  after dropping into the low s in   still it has hardly been an easy journey for niles who was promoted to cfo in  internally even with  billion in assets and  employees associated lacked some discipline in basic finance functions like internal performance reporting in a december interview with cfo excerpted here niles describes how he brought rigor to the bank’s operations and product strategy and why he doesn’t view tighter industry regulation negatively what kind of problems did previous management get into leading up to the financial crisis back in the fourth quarter of  associated bank had  percent construction loans  percent home equity lines and second mortgages and  percent consumer installment loans clearly as the economy turned those were three areas where you saw a lot of pain the prior management assumed that since construction lending is short term two to three years that the pain wouldn’t be that severe the problem of course is when a construction loan performs it’s a two or threeyear loan when it doesn’t it’s forever associated had decided to follow its customers to florida to arizona to colorado because that’s where people from wisconsin go in the winter but most of the time that’s a bad idea because those housing markets are generally more volatile than wisconsin’s and when you’re making loans you need people that are deeply embedded in that market you need people who live breathe and eat real estate in that market and understand why a certain corner works or doesn’t work and who has tried to develop there before and didn’t and what permit issues developers have had and what the traffic patterns are and if you don’t have people who are deeply embedded in the market you’re going to end up doing bad deals what was the path back for the bank the challenge the bank faced when i arrived here in  as treasurer was how do we put deposits to work how do we change the mix of the assets where do we find the assets that are prudent and appropriate to the bank and will bring us an earnings stream ceo phil flynn and i had worked together at union bank of california and during that time we’d been very a very active part of the expansion of union bank’s mortgage activities particularly a type of mortgage called the  hybrid arm we knew that those assets were very suitable for a bank and we knew how to go find them we brought a lot of refinancing activity into associated historically associated had refinanced customers from a year mortgage into another  year and that would just be sold off to fannie mae or freddie mac the  arm is a fiveyear fixed term loan that then adjusts on an annual basis the bank is very well suited to deposit lives of between  and  years so a mix of those mortgages is perfect for the balance sheet — we don’t take a longterm interest rate risk that we can’t hedge against we also realized that all of the other banks were pulling back their energy industry lending european banks were selling loans because they were dealing with credit and capital issues so we went looking for other institutions’ power and utility loans the typical borrower is a power plant that’s selling power typically on a contract basis to a public utility the public utility is always going to be ‘lights on’ that is the public utility is always going to pay their bills the only question is does the power plant know what it’s doing does it operate efficiently so we aggressively moved in and became the fillin power utility lender when all the european banks were pulling back since becoming cfo in  what have you focused on the real challenge was becoming head of finance at an organization that had historically been extremely decentralized we had a series of regional banking community teams and even regional cfos at one point that culture of decentralization had allowed for a lot of ‘interesting’ customized reporting everyone had their own way of looking at performance so we’d get reports on average loans from some teams and endofperiod loans from others there wasn’t a defined consistent set of metrics that people were held accountable for and that were produced by a central repository there were multiple versions of the truth when i first joined as treasurer for example i wanted to show quarterly trends for multiple years ok what’s the best internal source there wasn’t one all the financial the systems are pretty good at looking at the last  months they’re not very good at producing a fiveyear report but i could log on to an snl financial database and pull up the last  years of history in seconds and so for the first year i was doing all this reporting that the company had never seen before using public records what did you do to improve reporting our business is real time and the first thing we needed was realtime daily balance sheet data by division by group so that’s something we immediately put in place we created standardized reports and as treasurer this was important to me because if a customer deposits a lot of money i have to then probably at the margin go buy some bonds or deposit more money at the fed in the process of doing that i created standardized balance sheet reporting for every division so i could tell the guys in commercial lending here’s how you did the guys from real estate here’s how you did the guys from mortgage here’s how you did we ended up on the ibm cognos platform and introduced a series of ibm cognos executive portals and dashboards a landing spot for all the financial data what else did you do in the wake of the financial crisis to turn the bank around when you are struggling as a financial institution you can only do so much on the revenue side if the demand isn’t there for your loan products it’s not no matter how much you want to give away money but interestingly while banks are really good at credit risk and interestrate risk in general they’re really poor at analyzing their own costs on a product basis so we went through a process really beginning in  but culminating in  of doing a robust costing analysis we conducted timeandmotion studies of the folks in operations we figured out the  things they do and then how long they actually spend — how many minutes each day each week or each month — doing different tasks it has been the basis for what we call an ‘innovative profitability management solution’ that we rolled out again using ibm cognos we took all the data on costing and crunched it using a series of sas formulas and then published the data as costing variables for all the different functions for the first time we creating standardized centralized product costing information and we actually have true profitability views of our customers it comes with a philosophy that we’ve adopted but only recently institutionalized risk adjusted return on capital raroc essentially means not all loans or relationships are created equal there is inherently more risk in a home equity loan than there is in a first mortgage and commercial loans depending on what kind can be riskier still there are different types of regulatory capital that are applied we charge the customer capital based on what those rules are first and foremost and then we charge additional capital based on the risk of the borrower within that and then we charge an appropriate cost based on what it costs us to process and maintain this loan or relationship for example one of the things we discovered was that a national retailer had  million to  million in account balances every night and then we peeled back the costing data and found we were getting  cash deposits and  cash withdrawals by them every day it turns out that they were telling their store managers ‘don’t keep cash in the store overnight’ so every night the managers would clear out the cash put it in a little bag bring it to a branch and deposit it then every morning the first thing they did was to withdraw the cash they needed for the registers they were hitting almost our entire network anywhere there was a branch that was close to one of their stores if you want cash delivery there’s way better ways to do this than having your people come back and forth to our branches does the product costing information go into what you’re going to charge a business borrower absolutely that’s part and parcel of the realization that you may have to ‘touch’ for example a business line of credit every month at least or every time the collateral swaps out — unlike a real estate loan where you basically don’t have to touch it often did the bank factor that into the costs did it build in a higher spread or a higher fee to effectively capture that there’s going to be a cost to touch this loan every month at the end of the day there’s a regulatory minimum on capital those regulatory minimums work out to basically  percent so for every hundred dollars of a loan you need  cents of capital against it you need to earn a minimum return on that capital by the way if it’s a higherthanaverage risk loan it’s going to be more capital and you need to show me loan officer that we’re going to earn enough on this loan to make it worthwhile or else the answer is just ‘no’ we need a doubledigit return on capital plus percent so loan officer show me how on this hundred dollar loan net net if i put  dollars of capital on the balance sheet you’re going to earn  cents prove to me that we’re going to earn  cents bottom line after tax and by the way it’s bottom line after tax because ultimately that’s all our shareholders care about so we’ve reached the point where we’re delivering a  percent return which is where we want to be that sounds pretty healthy but it’s become increasingly difficult to stay there because the competition for assets today is so fierce postfinancial crisis the borrower had to have personal guarantees covenants and all the other things that a banker loves now some banks are starting to forget that they need those things and they’re starting to say well we’ll do without a personal guarantee we’ll do without a pledge of collateral we’ll do without the covenants and for us that just makes no sense we recognize that these things come in cycles we may be unfortunately returning to the frothier point in the cycle particularly for leveraged loans if you have that point of view what do you think of doddfrank if you’re disciplined you know what you’re doing and you’re rigorous in your analysis you can win with any set of rules if you’re undisciplined — you don’t know your costs you don’t know how your business will react — any set of rules will be a challenge for you right so as a person who sees himself as disciplined and structured and rigorous curiously enough the more rules the better we’re going to win in that environment what kind of headaches are the capital surcharges creating for you right now when associated bank’s loan book shrunk it actually had more capital than it needed the bank took some losses but it raised capital along the way it borrowed some tarp money and raised  million in equity we’ve been growing the loan book back into our capital we went back to the markets and we bought back  million plus of stock and repaid tarp with a bunch of debt but we still ended up with incrementally more capital i also have a less risky book from my perspective because i don’t have as much in the construction bucket i don’t have as much in the home equity bucket and i don’t have as much in the consumer installment bucket and my categories are the more granular traditional categories like commercial real estate and traditional commercial and industrial loans so the bottom line is that i’ve never had a capital constraint other than how fast can i give it back and so we’ve been repurchasing stock conservatively we’ve also been increasing our dividend for the last four years running and we will probably continue those things until we find acquisitions why haven’t there been more bank acquisitions now that the economy is recovering it’s very clear to us that the regulators have changed their outlook on bank assets it used to be if a selling bank had a regulatory issue ‘the rest of you circle up and figure out who’s going to take care of the issue and we’ll approve the buyer that has the strongest solution for fixing the issue’ now if a bank has an issue it’s a hot potato whoever buys it now owns the issue even though you didn’t originate the issue if you buy that bank you’re going to own whatever penalty the consumer financial protection bureau or a state attorney general decides should have been paid by the seller’ we went into a bank late last year a small community bank we said ‘ok we want to buy this bank’ normally we talk about pricing concerns we talk about revenue trends a team looked at  loan files in  files they found  truth in lending or respa real estate settlement procedures act violations essentially disclosure act violations how do you protect against that if that’s systematic — and  seems pretty systematic — then how do you trust anything else that comes from that bank so from our perspective the risk of acquisitions has gone up dramatically which is why we have not been buying leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published
