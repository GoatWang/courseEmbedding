some people complain about the size of it i however think its the perfect size and its fantastic in every way possible ive been nothing but happy with it date published  rated  out of  by sord from works great on tmobile i have had this watch for a few months now and i love it it is pretty awesome when my phone runs out of battery that i can make calls use ok google to search for stuff get navigation etc i have found this watch to be a great remindernotification device to keep me on top of things while in work mode the design is simple and clean and everything on it works pretty well sometimes it takes a moment for it to connect to the network which can be annoying but that is because its paired with the phone when it isnt paired with the phone it usually works faster guessing because its not trying to decide which signal to use anyway its a great smart watch that imho has helped me be more productive and safer while driving or riding my motorcycle date published  rated  out of  by freway from what a waste of my money ive tried everything to get better battery life and the only way i cam make it through the day is to turn all of the radios off including lte which is the primary reason i bought the lg watch sport date published  rated  out of  by stealthemployed from excellent smartwatch i really enjoy this watch it is my first smartwatch i have been waiting for years now to get a watch with all these features combined with the new android  experience despite what others have said my battery lasts me all day i have cellular service but keep it turned off when i dont need it i keep wifi on bluetooth on nfc on location on gestures off and tilt to wake on i also never use the always on feature i usually dont drop under  batter after  hours use lg i really enjoy the watch faces you provided with this watch in fact i enjoy them more than almost all rd party watch faces available right now probably because most watch faces dont take advantage of the new android wear  api yet even still i wish you would keep adding more date published  rated  out of  by deloskyga from great watch except for battery let me start by saying i am still very happy with this purchase i was only looking for a fitness tracker that had built in gps an interval timer for running and storage for my music all so i could run and workout at the gym without my phone this was the closest i could get to that and am fairly happy with all the features google fit works really well and has so much potential and im confident theyll continue to enhance it all that said the battery life is awful i went to the gym yesterday at  with aod cellular wifi and nfc all off the only thing i was running was bt for my headset google play music from downloaded music and google fit to track my weight training workout the phone powered off at  battery within the hour unacceptable why offer these features if you cant even get a full workout in i love this watch and will continue to push it to its limits but lg  you have to do something to manage battery life better on this device date published  rated  out of  by jowk from nice phone i bought the watch  days ago and recieved it  days ago because the att store was out of them the watch looks good and works fine the features are good and there are a few apps that can be added i would think more apps would come out in the future the only draw back it the battery it last about  hours when apps are not used to much the more the apps are uses or calls or texts are made the quicker the battery dies lg needs to address this issue date published  rated  out of  by phenix from lg needs to work on it first you dont find  app compatible form lg lg needs to make more apps for this watch like new faces and apps for setting

yesmost people dont know that the atampt model wa is compatible with verizon and sprint cdma networks im currently using my wa model on verizon right now the hardest part is to get verizon to issue you a sim card for a nonverizon product verizon will be reluctant to do this because its not company policy i had to go through a long frustrating process but i was able to get it done answered by jogup date published  from other answers it appears this watch is not sim locked to atampt is that correct asked by lageek now in englishsimpler termsthe lg watch sport model wa is the atampt model amp is intended to used on the atampt gsm network but most people dont know that model wa can also be used on verizon amp sprint cdma networks im currently using my wa model on verizon right now the only problem was getting verizon to program a sim card to be used in a nonverizon product verizon typically doesnt like to do this cause its not company policy but i was persistent but not disrespectful so i eventually got it done but it was a long frustrating process answered by jogup date published  do you have to have a sim card for it to work or can i just buy it and not have the sims i just want to watch itself i dont want nothing else beside to watch asked by motokiller you dont have to use the sim card for cellular service if you dont want to its an additional monthly cost on your phone bill just pay for that watch in full but dont activate the sim card you can still use the watch as a regular smart watch without the cellular service answered by jogup date published  how waterproof are we talking here can i shower with it i love this little watch asked by tanas the correct answer to this question is nope its wet rating just means you cant sweat this watch to death you can kill it with a shower though at present only the pebble smart watch which ahs been discontinued and the apple watch ii are the only  for sure swim proof watches garmen makes a couple you could shower with too but theyre god awful ugly things answered by the tiki lab date published  can watch be used with tmobile asked by gvern yes it works on tmobile i have it working with a sim from tmobile its easy just go in there ask for a sim for a smartwatch should be an extra  a month with its own phone number just put it in and it works answered by sord date published  wa questions  page
