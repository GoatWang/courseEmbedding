audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the companys annual report on form k for the year ended december   filed with the securities and exchange commission the sec on march   and keeping in mind this cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information results of operations the companys revenues are derived from i royalties paid by licensees of the companys technologies ii fees for the provision of technical services to licensees and iii the direct sale of a products incorporating the companys technologies such as inks security paper and pressure sensitive labels and b equipment used to support the application of the companys technologies such as inkjet printing systems royalties consist of guaranteed minimum royalties payable by the companys licensees andor additional royalties which typically vary with the licensees sales or production of products incorporating the licensed technology technical services in the form of onsite or telephone consultations by members of the companys technical staff may be offered to licensees of the companys technologies the consulting fees are billed at agreed upon per diem or hourly rates at the time the services are rendered service fees and sales revenues vary directly with the number of units of service or product provided the company recognizes revenue on its lines of business as follows a license fees and royalties are recognized when the license term begins upon inception of the license term revenue is recognized in a manner consistent with the nature of the transaction and the earnings process which generally is ratably over the license term b product sales are recognized upon shipment of products when the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured and c fees for technical services are recognized when i the service has been rendered ii an arrangement exists iii the price is fixed or determinable based upon a per diem or hourly rate and iv collectability is reasonably assured    the company believes that as fixed cost reductions beyond those it has achieved in recent years may not be achievable its operating results are substantially dependent on revenue levels because revenues derived from licenses and royalties carry a much higher gross profit margin than other revenues operating results are also substantially affected by changes in revenue mix both the absolute amounts of the companys revenues and the mix among the various sources of revenue are subject to substantial fluctuation the company has a relatively small number of substantial customers rather than a large number of small customers accordingly changes in the revenue received from a significant customer can have a substantial effect on the companys total revenue revenue mix and overall financial performance such changes may result from a customers product development delays engineering changes changes in product marketing strategies production requirements and the like in addition certain customers have from time to time sought to renegotiate certain provisions of their license agreements and when the company agrees to revise terms revenues from the customer may be affected the addition of a substantial new customer or the loss of a substantial existing customer may also have a substantial effect on the companys total revenue revenue mix and operating results revenues for the first quarter of  were  compared to  in the first quarter of  an increase of  or approximately  licenses royalties and fees increased by  or approximately  in the first quarter of  to  from  in the first quarter of  the increase in licenses royalties and fees is due primarily to higher licensing revenue received from four licensees including one licensee added in the second half of  there can be no assurances that the marketing and product development activities of the companys licensees or other businesses in the entertainment and toy products market will produce a significant increase in revenues for the company nor can the timing of any potential revenue increases be predicted particularly given the uncertain economic conditions being experienced worldwide product and other sales increased by  or approximately  to  in the first quarter of  from  in the first quarter of  sales of ink increased in the first quarter of  compared to the first quarter of  due primarily to higher ink shipments to the third party authorized printers used by two of the companys major licensees in the entertainment and toy products market offset in part by lower ink shipments to the companys licensees in the retail receipt and document fraud market in the first quarter of  the company derived revenues of approximately  from its licensees and their authorized printers in the entertainment and toy products market compared to revenues of approximately  in the first quarter of  the companys gross profit increased to  or approximately  of gross revenues in the first quarter of  from  or approximately  of gross revenues in the first quarter of  licenses royalties and fees have historically carried a higher gross profit than product and other sales which generally consist of either supplies or other manufactured products which incorporate the companys technologies or equipment used to support the application of its technologies these items except for inks which are manufactured by the company are generally purchased from thirdparty vendors and resold to the enduser or licensee and carry a lower gross profit than licenses royalties and fees as the variable component of cost of revenues related to licenses royalties and fees is a low percentage of these revenues and the fixed component is not substantial period to period changes in revenues from licenses royalties and fees can significantly affect both the gross profit from these sources as well as the companys overall gross profit primarily due to the increase in revenues from licenses royalties and fees in the first quarter of  compared to the first quarter of  the gross profit from licenses royalties and fees increased to approximately  in the first quarter of  from approximately  in the first quarter of  the gross profit of product and other sales expressed as a percentage of revenues is dependent on both the overall sales volumes of product and other sales and on the mix of the specific goods produced andor sold primarily due to higher sales of inks and other products and a favorable product mix in the first quarter of  compared to the first quarter of  there was a higher gross profit from product and other sales of approximately  of revenues in the first quarter of  compared to a gross profit of approximately  of revenues in the first quarter of  research and development expenses of  in the first quarter of  were comparable to  in the first quarter of  sales and marketing expenses increased to  in the first quarter of

of convertible debentures the higher net income of  in the first quarter of  compared to  in the first quarter of  resulted primarily from a higher gross profit on a higher level of revenues offset in

during the first quarter of  the companys cash decreased to  at march   from  at december   during the first quarter of  the company used  to fund its operating activities and  for capital equipment

borrowings allowed the company to remain in operation through late  when the companys cash flow increased significantly there can be no assurances that the company will be able to secure sufficient additional funding if needed through investments or borrowings the company believes that without additional investment it may be forced to cease operations at an undetermined date in the future if it is unable to sustain revenues at levels equal to or greater than it achieved in  the companys plan of operation for the twelve months beginning with the date of this quarterly report consists of concentrating available human and financial resources to continue to capitalize on the specific business relationships the company has developed in the entertainment and toy products market including two licensees with a significant presence in the entertainment and toy products market that have been marketing products incorporating the companys technologies since  these two licensees in the entertainment and toy products market are well known and highly regarded participants in this market the company believes that these two licensees will expand their offerings incorporating the companys technologies currently being marketed and will introduce new products incorporating available technologies covered by the license agreements that are not currently being marketed by them the company plans to continue developing applications for these licensees while expanding its licensee base in the entertainment and toy market the company has additional licensees marketing or developing products incorporating the companys technologies in certain geographic and niche markets of the overall entertainment and toy products market in late  the company added a licensee who began marketing products incorporating the companys available technologies in certain international markets in  the company maintains its presence in the retail loss prevention market and believes that revenue growth in this market can be achieved through increased security ink sales to its licensees in this market the company will continue to adjust its production and technical staff as necessary the company will also subject to available financial resources invest in capital equipment needed to support potential growth in ink production requirements beyond its current capacity additionally the company will pursue opportunities to market its current technologies in specific security and nonsecurity markets there can be no assurances that these efforts will enable the company to generate additional revenues and positive cash flow    the company has received and may continue to seek additional capital in the form of debt equity or both to support its working capital requirements there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in raising additional capital or that such additional capital if obtained will enable the company to generate additional revenues and positive cash flow the company generates a significant portion of its total revenues from licensees in the entertainment and toy products market these licensees generally sell their products through retail outlets during the year such sales may be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending that may occur as a result of an uncertain economic environment as a result the companys revenues results of operations and liquidity may be negatively impacted as they were in previous years risk factors the companys operating results financial condition and stock price are subject to certain risks some of which are beyond the companys control these risks could cause actual operating and financial results to differ materially from those expressed in the companys forwardlooking statements including the risks described below and the risks identified in other documents which are filed and furnished with the sec including the companys annual report on form k for the year ended december   that was

filings for those periods have not been filed certain financial information disclosures and discussions normally contained in a form q were not included in the form k the omission of the information that would have been contained in these periodic filings leaves current and prospective investors customers employees and others without this source of information about the companys business achievements and prospects and may negatively impact the companys business opportunities and its ability to raise capital there can be no assurances that the company will be able to remain current with its required sec filing obligations in the future access to capital the company anticipates that it may need to raise capital in the future to fund its historical and new business operations negative or uncertain global economic conditions could make it more difficult for the company to raise capital if the company is unable to secure capital if needed in the future in the form debt equity or both it may be forced to cease operations there can be no assurances that if required the company will be successful in obtaining additional investment in sufficient amounts to fund its ongoing business operations dependency on major customers the company is dependent on its licensees to develop new products and markets that will generate increases in its licensing and product revenues the inability of the companys licensees to maintain at least current levels of sales of products utilizing the companys technologies could adversely affect the companys operating results and cash flow to the extent that the companys licensees are affected by negative economic conditions the companys revenues may also be negatively impacted the company derives a significant percentage of its revenues through licensing relationships with two major customers revenues obtained directly from these two licensees and indirectly through the licensees third party authorized printers equaled approximately  of the companys revenues in the first quarter of  and approximately  of the companys revenues in the year ended december   receivables from these two licensees and their third party authorized printers were approximately  and  of the companys net accounts receivable at march   and december   respectively the company has a license agreement containing guaranteed minimum royalties which will be met during  expiring in  with one of these two licensees and a license with the second that expires in  products incorporating the companys technologies that are sold by these two licensees have certain dissimilar characteristics and are marketed generally through distinctly different channels of distribution these two licensees are well known and highly regarded participants in the entertainment and toy products market the agreements with both licensees contain renewal options but there can be no assurances that the licenses will continue in force at the same or more favorable terms beyond their current termination dates nor can there be any assurances that the relationships with these two licensees will generate increased revenues for the company in the future    possible inability to develop new business  management of the company believes that any significant improvement in the companys cash flow must result from increases in revenues from traditional sources and from new revenue sources the company raised cash through additional capital investment and loans from investors in   and  the company also benefited from limiting increases in its operating expenses and reducing its operating expenses when possible the companys ability to develop new revenues may depend on the extent of its marketing activities and its research and development activities both of which are limited there are no assurances that the resources that the company can devote to marketing and to research and development will be sufficient to increase its revenues to levels that will enable it to maintain positive operating cash flow in the future inability to obtain raw materials and products for resale the companys adverse financial condition in years prior to  has required it from time to time to significantly defer payments due to i vendors who supply raw materials and other components of its security inks ii providers of professional and other services and iii certain employees to whom salary and sales commissions are owed as a result the company is required to pay cash in advance of shipment to certain of its suppliers the inability to obtain materials on a timely basis and the possibility that certain vendors may permanently discontinue supplying the company with needed products and services may result in delayed shipments to customers and further impact the companys ability to service its customers thereby adversely affecting the companys relationships with its customers and licensees there can be no assurances that the company will be able to maintain its vendor relationships in an acceptable manner uneven pattern of quarterly and annual operating results  the companys revenues which are derived primarily from licensing royalties and sales of products incorporating its technologies are difficult to forecast such forecasting difficulty is due to among other reasons  the long sales cycle of the companys technologies the potential for customer delay or deferral of implementation of the companys technologies the size and timing of inception of individual license agreements the success of the companys licensees and strategic partners in exploiting the market for the licensed products modifications of customer budgets and uneven patterns of royalty revenue and product orders as the companys revenue base is not substantial delays in finalizing license contracts implementing the technology to initiate the revenue stream and ordering decisions of customers can have a material adverse effect on the companys quarterly and annual revenue expectations as the companys operating expenses are substantially fixed income expectations will be subject to a similar adverse outcome as licensees for the entertainment and toy products markets are added the predictability of the companys revenue stream may be further impacted volatility of stock price  the market price for the companys common stock has historically experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to do so from inception with the exception of    and  the company has operated at a loss and has not produced revenue levels traditionally associated with publiclytraded companies the companys common stock is not listed on a national or regional securities exchange and consequently the company receives limited publicity regarding its business achievements and prospects additionally securities analysts and traders do not extensively follow the companys stock and its stock is thinly traded the companys market price may be affected by announcements of new relationships or modifications to existing relationships the stock prices of many developing public companies particularly those with small capitalizations have experienced wide fluctuations not necessarily related to operating performance such fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the companys common stock intellectual property the company relies on a combination of protections as may be available under applicable domestic foreign or international patent trademark and trade secret laws the company also relies on confidentiality nonanalysis and licensing agreements to establish and protect its rights in its proprietary technologies while the company attempts to protect these rights its technologies may be compromised through reverse engineering independent invention or other means in addition the companys ability to enforce its intellectual property rights through appropriate legal action has been and will continue to be limited by its adverse liquidity there can be no assurances that the company will be able to protect the basis of its technologies from discovery by third parties or to preclude third parties from conducting activities that infringe on the companys rights the companys adverse liquidity situation also impacts its ability to obtain patent protection on its intellectual property and to maintain protection on previously issued patents there can be no assurances that the company will be able to continue to prosecute new patents and maintain issued patents as a result the companys customer and licensee relationships could be adversely affected and the value of the companys technologies and intellectual property including their value upon liquidation could be substantially diminished    economic conditions  the companys revenue is susceptible to changes in general economic conditions the companys sales liquidity and overall results of operations may be negatively affected by decreasing consumer confidence slowdowns in consumer spending or other downturns in the us economy as a whole or in any geographic markets from which the company derives revenue in addition these factors may result in decreased customer and licensee demand for the companys products and may negatively impact the companys ability to develop new customers and licensees due to uncertainties surrounding the worldwide economy the company is unable to predict the effect of such conditions on its customers and licensees consequently the company cannot predict the scope or magnitude of the negative effect resulting from ongoing global financial uncertainties or economic slowdowns recently adopted accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued asu no  compensation  stock

factors and other cautionary statements set forth in this item  and elsewhere in this form q the companys forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date made the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise the following managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report as well as with the companys audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the companys annual report on form k for the year ended december   filed with the securities and exchange commission the sec on september   and keeping in mind this cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information results of operations the companys revenues are derived from i royalties paid by licensees of the companys technologies ii fees for the provision of technical services to licensees and iii the direct sale of a products incorporating the companys technologies such as inks security paper and pressure sensitive labels and b equipment used to support the application of the companys technologies such as inkjet printing systems royalties consist of guaranteed minimum royalties payable by the companys licensees andor additional royalties which typically vary with the licensees sales or production of products incorporating the licensed technology technical services in the form of onsite or telephone consultations by members of the companys technical staff may be offered to licensees of the companys technologies the consulting fees are billed at agreed upon per diem or hourly rates at the time the services are rendered service fees and sales revenues vary directly with the number of units of service or product provided the company recognizes revenue on its lines of business as follows a license fees and royalties are recognized when the license term begins upon inception of the license term revenue is recognized in a manner consistent with the nature of the transaction and the earnings process which generally is ratably over the license term b product sales are recognized i upon shipment of products ii when the price is fixed or determinable and iii when collectability is reasonably assured and c fees for technical services are recognized when i the service has been rendered ii an arrangement exists iii the price is fixed or determinable based upon a per diem or hourly rate and iv collectability is reasonably assured    the company believes that as fixed cost reductions beyond those it has achieved in recent years may not be achievable its operating results are substantially dependent on revenue levels because revenues derived from licenses and royalties carry a much higher gross profit margin than other revenues operating results are also substantially affected by changes in revenue mix both the absolute amounts of the companys revenues and the mix among the various sources of revenue are subject to substantial fluctuation the company has a relatively small number of substantial customers rather than a large number of small customers accordingly changes in the revenue received from a significant customer can have a substantial effect on the companys total revenue and on its revenue mix and overall financial performance such changes may result from a customers product development delays engineering changes changes in product marketing strategies and the like in addition certain customers have from time to time sought to renegotiate certain provisions of their license agreements and when the company agrees to revise terms revenues from the customer may be affected the addition of a substantial new customer or the loss of a substantial existing customer may also have a substantial effect on the companys total revenue revenue mix and operating results revenues for the third quarter of  were  compared to  in the third quarter of  an increase of  or approximately  licenses royalties and fees decreased by  or approximately  to  in the third quarter of  from  in the third quarter of  the decrease in licenses royalties and fees is due primarily to lower quarterly licensing revenues from an existing licensee in the entertainment and toy products market who signed a new fouryear license late in the second quarter of  offset in part by higher royalties from certain licensees including one new licensee while the financial terms of the new fouryear license with the existing licensee approximate the former license in the aggregate the timing and amount of payments of the license fees over the term of the new license are different from the earlier license there can be no assurances that the marketing and product development activities of the companys licensees or other businesses in the entertainment and toy products market will produce a significant increase in revenues for the company nor can the timing of any potential revenue increases be predicted particularly given the uncertain economic conditions being experienced worldwide product and other sales increased by  or approximately  to  in the third quarter of  from  in the third quarter of  sales of ink increased in the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  due primarily to higher ink shipments to a third party authorized printer used by two of the companys major licensees in the entertainment and toy products market in the third quarter of  the company derived revenues of approximately  from its licensees and their authorized printers in the entertainment and toy products market compared to revenues of approximately  in the third quarter of  for the first nine months of  revenues were  representing an increase of  or approximately  higher than revenues of  in the first nine months of  licenses royalties and fees of  in the first nine months of  were  or approximately  lower than licenses royalties and fees of  in the first nine months of  the decrease in licenses royalties and fees in the first nine months of  compared to the first nine months of  is due primarily to lower consulting revenue related to the expiration of a consulting arrangement with a customer in  offset in part by higher licensing revenues from existing licensees in the entertainment and toy products market product and other sales increased by  or approximately  to  in the first nine months of  from  in the first nine months of  sales of ink increased in the first nine months of  compared to the first nine months of  due primarily to higher ink shipments to a third party authorized printer used by two of the companys major licensees in the entertainment and toy products market offset in part by lower ink shipments to the companys licensees in the retail receipt and document fraud market the company derived revenues of approximately  from licensees and their authorized printers in the entertainment and toy products market in the first nine months of  compared to revenues of approximately  in the first nine months of     the companys gross profit increased to  in the third quarter of  or approximately  of revenues from  in the third quarter of  or approximately  of revenues licenses royalties and fees have historically carried a higher gross profit than product and other sales such other sales generally consist of supplies or other manufactured products which incorporate the companys technologies or equipment used to support the application of its technologies these items except for inks which are manufactured by the company are generally purchased from thirdparty vendors and resold to the enduser or licensee and carry a lower gross profit than licenses royalties and fees the higher gross profit in the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  results primarily from higher gross revenues from product and other sales in the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  along with gross profit improvements related to both the mix of products sold and favorable raw material prices in the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  offset in part by lower gross revenues from licenses royalties and fees and product and other sales in the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  for the first nine months of  gross profit was  or approximately  of revenues compared to  or approximately  of revenues in the first nine months of  the higher gross profit in the first nine months of  compared to the first nine months of  results from the same positive factors as the increase in the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  as the variable component of cost of revenues related to licenses royalties and fees is a low percentage of these revenues and the fixed component is not substantial period to period changes in revenues from licenses royalties and fees can significantly affect both the gross profit from licenses royalties and fees as well as overall gross profit primarily due to lower revenues from licenses royalties and fees in the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  the gross profit from licenses royalties and fees declined to approximately  of revenues in the third quarter of  from approximately  of revenues in the third quarter of  the gross profit from licenses royalties and fees was approximately  in the first nine months of  compared to approximately  in first nine months of  resulting from the same factors as the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  the gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues of product and other sales is dependent on both the overall sales volumes of product and other sales and on the mix of the specific goods produced andor sold the gross profit from product and other sales increased to approximately  of revenues in the third quarter of  compared to approximately  of revenues in the third quarter of  this increase was due to favorable margins on certain products due to a favorable mix of products sold and raw materials prices for the first nine months of  the gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues increased to approximately  of revenues from product and other sales compared to approximately  of revenues from product and other sales in the first nine months of  research and development expenses of  in the third quarter of  and  in the first nine months of  were comparable to  in the third quarter of  and  in first nine months of  sales and marketing expenses increased to  in the third quarter of  from  in the third quarter of  and to  in the first nine months of  from  in the first nine months of  this increase is due primarily to higher commission expense on the higher level of sales in the third quarter and first nine months of  compared to the third quarter and first nine months of  general and administrative expenses increased in the third quarter and first nine months of  to  and  respectively from  and  in the third quarter and first nine months of  respectively due primarily to higher expenses incurred in the third quarter and first nine months of  compared to the third quarter and first nine months of  related to the companys filing of the comprehensive annual report on form k and the first and second quarter  form qs that were filed during the third quarter of  these expenses included legal and audit fees incurred in the third quarter and first nine months of  as well as expenses related to the electronic filing of the documents other income expenses in the three months and nine months ended september   and september   includes interest on unsecured loans from five individuals on convertible debentures held by ten investors and in  on funds borrowed under the companys promissory note with a bank the net loss of  and  in the third quarter and first nine months of  respectively compared to the net loss of  and  in the third quarter and first nine months of  respectively resulted primarily from a higher gross profit on a higher level of revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of  compared to the third quarter and first nine months of  offset by higher overhead expenses along with accretion of interest in the third quarter and first nine months of  compared to the third quarter and first nine months of     plan of operation liquidity and capital resources during the first nine months of  the companys cash increased to  at september   from  at december   during the first nine months of  the company generated  from its operating activities used  for capital equipment repaid  to a convertible debenture holder and repaid  to two individual lenders during the first nine months of  the companys revenues increased primarily as a result of higher sales of ink to the authorized printer of four of the companys licensees in the entertainment and toy products market and higher license fees from a licensee in the entertainment and toy products market the companys total overhead expenses increased in the first nine months of  compared to the total overhead expenses in the first nine months of  as a result of these factors the companys net loss increased in the first nine months of  compared to the first nine months of  the company had positive operating cash flow of  during the first nine months of  at september   the company had negative working capital of  and a stockholders deficiency of  for the full year of  the company had net income of  and had positive operating cash flow of  at december   the company had negative working capital of  and a  stockholders deficiency during  the company accepted an offer by a bank to repay the then outstanding balance of  under its line of credit received in  with that bank in fortyeight equal monthly installments plus interest beginning in october  the remaining outstanding balance was repaid in july  through september   the company repaid  of  in unsecured loans borrowed from five individuals converted  of the principal of the unsecured loans and approximately  of accrued interest into  shares of its common stock and exchanged  of the principal of the unsecured loans and approximately  of accrued interest for convertible debentures totaling approximately  in  and  the company raised  through the sale of convertible debentures to eight investors and in  repaid  of the convertible debentures these borrowings and sales of common stock in recent years have allowed the company to remain in operation through the current date there can be no assurances that the company will be able to secure sufficient additional funding through investments or borrowings that will allow the company to fund losses that it presently believes may continue during  the company believes that without additional investment it may be forced to cease operations at an undetermined date in the future the companys plan of operation for the twelve months beginning with the date of this quarterly report consists of concentrating available human and financial resources to continue to capitalize on the specific business relationships the company has developed in the entertainment and toy products market including two licensees with a significant presence in the entertainment and toy products market that have been marketing products incorporating the companys technologies since  these two licensees in the entertainment and toy products market are well known and highly regarded participants in this market the company believes that these two licensees will expand their offerings incorporating the companys technologies currently being marketed and will introduce new products incorporating available technologies covered by the license agreements that are not currently being marketed by them the company plans to continue developing applications for these licensees while expanding its licensee base in the entertainment and toy market the company has additional licensees marketing or developing products incorporating the companys technologies in certain niche markets of the overall entertainment and toy products market the company maintains its presence in the retail loss prevention market and believes that revenue growth in this market can be achieved through increased security ink sales to its licensees in this market the company will continue to adjust its production and technical staff as necessary the company will also subject to available financial resources invest in capital equipment needed to support potential growth in ink production requirements beyond its current capacity additionally the company will pursue opportunities to market its current technologies in specific security and nonsecurity markets there can be no assurances that these efforts will enable the company to generate additional revenues and positive cash flow the company has received and continues to seek additional capital in the form of debt equity or both to support its working capital requirements there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in raising additional capital or that such additional capital if obtained will enable the company to generate additional revenues and positive cash flow the company generates a significant portion of its total revenues from licensees in the entertainment and toy products market these licensees generally sell their products through retail outlets during the year such sales may be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending that may occur as a result of an uncertain economic environment as a result the companys revenues results of operations and liquidity may be negatively impacted as they were in previous years    risk factors the companys operating results financial condition and stock price are subject to certain risks some of which are beyond the companys control these risks could cause actual operating and financial results to differ materially from those expressed in the companys forwardlooking statements including the risks described below and the risks identified in other documents which are filed and furnished with the sec including the companys annual report on form k for the year ended december   that was filed with the sec on september   limited interim historical information the company filed a comprehensive annual report on form k for the fiscal years ended december    and  on september   the form k contains summarized quarterly financial information for each of the quarters ended june  and september   and for each of the quarters ended march  june  and september   and  as the complete periodic filings for those periods have not been filed certain financial information disclosures and discussions normally contained in a form q were not included in the form k the omission of the information that would have been contained in these periodic filings leaves current and prospective investors customers employees and others without this source of information about the companys business achievements and prospects and may negatively impact the companys business opportunities and its ability to raise capital there can be no assurances that the company will be able to remain current with its required sec filing obligations in the future access to capital the company anticipates that it may need to raise capital in the future to fund its historical and new business operations negative or uncertain global economic conditions could make it more difficult for the company to raise capital if the company is unable to secure capital if needed in the future in the form debt equity or both it may be forced to cease operations there can be no assurances that if required the company will be successful in obtaining additional investment in sufficient amounts to fund its ongoing business operations dependency on major customers the company is dependent on its licensees to develop new products and markets that will generate increases in its licensing and product revenues the inability of the companys licensees to maintain at least current levels of sales of products utilizing the companys technologies could adversely affect the companys operating results and cash flow to the extent that the companys licensees are affected by negative economic conditions the companys revenues may also be negatively impacted the company derives a significant percentage of its revenues through licensing relationships with two major customers revenues obtained directly from these two licensees and indirectly through the licensees third party authorized printer equaled approximately  and  of the companys revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of  respectively and approximately  of the companys revenues in  the company also has from time to time substantial receivables from these businesses the company has a license agreement containing guaranteed minimum royalties expiring in  with one of these two licensees and a license with the second that expires in  products incorporating the companys technologies that are sold by these two licensees have certain dissimilar characteristics and are marketed generally through distinctly different channels of distribution these two licensees are well known and highly regarded participants in the entertainment and toy products market the agreements with both licensees contain renewal options but there can be no assurances that the licenses will continue in force at the same or more favorable terms beyond their current termination dates nor can there be any assurances that the relationships with these two licensees will generate increased revenues for the company in the future possible inability to develop new business  management of the company believes that any significant improvement in the companys cash flow must result from increases in revenues from traditional sources and from new revenue sources the company raised cash through additional capital investment and loans from investors in   and  the company also benefited from limiting increases in its operating expenses and reducing its operating expenses when possible the companys ability to develop new revenues may depend on the extent of its marketing activities and its research and development activities both of which are limited there are no assurances that the resources that the company can devote to marketing and to research and development will be sufficient to increase its revenues to levels that will enable it to maintain positive operating cash flow in the future    inability to obtain raw materials and products for resale the companys adverse financial condition in the past has required it to significantly defer payments due to i vendors who supply raw materials and other components of the lines of inks marketed by the company ii providers of professional and other services and iii certain employees to whom salary and sales commissions are owed as a result the company is required to pay cash in advance of shipment to certain of its suppliers the inability to obtain materials on a timely basis and the possibility that certain vendors may permanently discontinue supplying the company with needed products and services threaten to result in delayed shipments to customers and further impact the companys ability to service its customers thereby adversely affecting the companys relationships with its customers and licensees there can be no assurances that the company will be able to maintain its vendor relationships in an acceptable manner uneven pattern of quarterly and annual operating results  the companys revenues which are derived primarily from licensing royalties and sales of products incorporating its technologies are difficult to forecast such forecasting difficulty is due to among other reasons the long sales cycle of the companys technologies the potential for customer delay or deferral of implementation of the companys technologies the size and timing of inception of individual license agreements the success of the companys licensees and strategic partners in exploiting the market for the licensed products modifications of customer budgets and uneven patterns of royalty revenue and product orders as the companys revenue base is not substantial delays in finalizing license contracts implementing the technology to initiate the revenue stream and ordering decisions of customers can have a material adverse effect on the companys quarterly and annual revenue expectations as the companys operating expenses are substantially fixed income expectations will be subject to a similar adverse outcome as licensees for the entertainment and toy products markets are added the predictability of the companys revenue stream may be further impacted volatility of stock price  the market price for the companys common stock has historically experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to do so from inception with the exception of   and  the company has operated at a loss and has not produced revenue levels traditionally associated with publiclytraded companies the companys common stock is not listed on a national or regional securities exchange and consequently the company receives limited publicity regarding its business achievements and prospects additionally securities analysts and traders do not extensively follow the companys stock and its stock is thinly traded the companys market price may be affected by announcements of new relationships or modifications to existing relationships the stock prices of many developing public companies particularly those with small capitalizations have experienced wide fluctuations not necessarily related to operating performance such fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the companys common stock intellectual property the company relies on a combination of protections provided under applicable international patent trademark and trade secret laws the company also relies on confidentiality nonanalysis and licensing agreements to establish and protect its rights in its proprietary technologies while the company actively attempts to protect these rights its technologies may be compromised through reverse engineering or other means in addition the companys ability to enforce its intellectual property rights through appropriate legal action has been and will continue to be limited by its adverse liquidity there can be no assurances that the company will be able to protect the basis of its technologies from discovery by unauthorized third parties or to preclude unauthorized persons from conducting activities that infringe on the companys rights the companys adverse liquidity situation also impacts its ability to obtain patent protection on its intellectual property and to maintain protection on previously issued patents there can be no assurances that the company will be able to continue to prosecute new patents and maintain issued patents as a result the companys customer and licensee relationships could be adversely affected and the value of the companys technologies and intellectual property including their value upon liquidation could be substantially diminished economic conditions  the companys revenue is susceptible to changes in general economic conditions the companys sales liquidity and overall results of operations may be negatively affected by decreasing consumer confidence slowdowns in consumer spending or other downturns in the us economy as a whole or in any geographic markets from which the company derives revenue in addition these factors may result in decreased customer and licensee demand for the companys products and may negatively impact the companys ability to develop new customers and licensees due to uncertainties surrounding the worldwide economy the company is unable to predict the effect of such conditions on its customers and licensees consequently the company cannot predict the scope or magnitude of the negative effect resulting from ongoing global financial uncertainties or economic slowdowns recently adopted accounting pronouncements as of

thereto included in the companys annual report on form k for the year ended december   filed with the securities and exchange commission the sec on march   and keeping in mind this cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information results of operations the companys revenues are derived from i royalties paid by licensees of the companys technologies ii fees for the provision of technical services to licensees and iii the direct sale of a products incorporating the companys technologies such as inks security paper and pressure sensitive labels and the company recognizes revenue on its lines of business as follows a license fees and royalties are recognized when the license term begins upon inception of the license term revenue is recognized in a manner consistent with the nature of the transaction and the earnings process which generally is ratably over the license term b product sales are recognized i upon shipment of products ii when the price is fixed or determinable and iii when collectability is reasonably assured and c fees for technical services are recognized when i the service has been rendered ii an arrangement exists iii the price is fixed or determinable based upon a per diem or hourly rate and iv collectability is reasonably assured the company believes that as fixed cost reductions beyond those it has achieved in recent years may not be achievable its operating results are substantially dependent on revenue levels because revenues derived from licenses and royalties carry a much higher gross profit margin than other revenues operating results are also substantially affected by changes in revenue mix both the absolute amounts of the companys revenues and the mix among the various sources of revenue are subject to substantial fluctuation the company has a relatively small number of substantial customers rather than a large number of small customers accordingly changes in the revenue received from a significant customer can have a substantial effect on the companys total revenue and on its revenue mix and overall financial performance such changes may result from a customers product development delays engineering changes changes in product marketing strategies and the like in addition certain customers have from time to time sought to renegotiate certain provisions of their license agreements and when the company agrees to revise terms revenues from the customer may be affected the addition of a substantial new customer or the loss of a substantial existing customer may also have a substantial effect on the companys total revenue revenue mix and operating results revenues for the third quarter of  were  compared to  in the third quarter of  an increase of  or approximately  licenses royalties and fees increased by  or approximately  to  in the third quarter of  from  in the third quarter of  the increase in licenses royalties and fees is due primarily to higher quarterly licensing revenues from an existing licensee in the entertainment and toy products market who signed a new fouryear license late in the second quarter of  along with higher royalties from certain licensees including one new licensee there can be no assurances that the marketing and product development activities of the companys licensees or other businesses in the entertainment and toy products market will produce sustained increases in revenues for the company nor can the timing of any potential revenue increases be predicted particularly given the uncertain economic conditions being experienced worldwide product and other sales increased by  or approximately  to  in the third quarter of  from  in the third quarter of  sales of ink increased in the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  due primarily to a significant volume of ink shipped in the third quarter of  to a new third party authorized printer used by one of the companys major licensees in the entertainment and toy products market offset in part by lower ink shipments to the companys licensees in the retail receipt and document fraud market in the third quarter of  the company derived revenues of approximately  from its licensees and their authorized printers in the entertainment and toy products market compared to revenues of approximately  in the third quarter of  for the first nine months of  revenues were  representing an increase of  or approximately  higher than revenues of  in the first nine months of  licenses royalties and fees of  in the first nine months of  were  or approximately  higher than licenses royalties and fees of  in the first nine months of  the increase in licenses royalties and fees in the first nine months of  compared to the first nine months of  is due primarily to higher licensing revenues from existing licensees in the entertainment and toy products market product and other sales increased by  or approximately  to  in the first nine months of  from  in the first nine months of  sales of ink increased in the first nine months of  compared to the first nine months of  due primarily to a higher volume of ink shipped to the third party authorized printers used by two of the companys major licensees in the entertainment and toy products market offset in part by lower ink shipments to the companys licensees in the retail receipt and document fraud market the company derived revenues of approximately  from licensees and their authorized printers in the entertainment and toy products market in the first nine months of  compared to revenues of approximately  in the first nine months of  the companys gross profit increased to  in the third quarter of  or approximately  of revenues from  in the third quarter of  or approximately  of revenues licenses royalties and fees have historically carried a higher gross profit than product and other sales such other sales generally consist of supplies or other manufactured products which incorporate the companys technologies or equipment used to support the application of its technologies these items except for inks which are manufactured by the company are generally purchased from thirdparty vendors and resold to the enduser or licensee and carry a lower gross profit than licenses royalties and fees the higher gross profit in the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  results primarily from higher gross revenues from licenses royalties and fees and from product and other sales in the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  for the first nine months of  gross profit was  or approximately  of revenues compared to  or approximately  of revenues in the first nine months of  the higher gross profit in the first nine months of  compared to the first nine months of  results from the same positive factors as the increase in the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  as the variable component of cost of revenues related to licenses royalties and fees is a low percentage of these revenues and the fixed component is not substantial period to period changes in revenues from licenses royalties and fees can significantly affect both the gross profit from licenses royalties and fees as well as overall gross profit primarily due to higher revenues from licenses royalties and fees in the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  the gross profit from licenses royalties and fees increased to approximately  of revenues in the third quarter of  from approximately  of revenues in the third quarter of  the gross profit from licenses royalties and fees was approximately  in the first nine months of  compared to approximately  in first nine months of  resulting from the same factors as the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  the gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues of product and other sales is dependent on both the overall sales volumes of product and other sales and on the mix of the specific goods produced andor sold the gross profit from product and other sales decreased to approximately  of revenues in the third quarter of  compared to approximately  of revenues in the third quarter of  this decrease in the gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to a change in mix of products sold during the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  for the first nine months of  the gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased to approximately  of revenues from product and other sales compared to approximately  of revenues from product and other sales in the first nine months of  research and development expenses of  in the third quarter of  and  in the first nine months of  were comparable to  in the third quarter of  and  in the first nine months of  sales and marketing expenses increased to  in the third quarter of  from  in the third quarter of  and to  in the first nine months of  from  in the first nine months of  this increase is due primarily to higher commission expense on the higher level of sales in the third quarter and first nine months of  compared to the third quarter and first nine months of  general and administrative expenses decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of  to  and  respectively from  and  in the third quarter and first nine months of  respectively due primarily to lower legal and audit expenses incurred in the third quarter and first nine months of  compared to the third quarter and first nine months of  in the third quarter of  the company incurred significant expenses related to the filing of the comprehensive annual report on form k and the first and second quarter  form qs that were filed during the third quarter of  these expenses included legal and audit fees in the third quarter and first nine months of  as well as expenses related to the electronic filing of the documents other income expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of  and  included interest on unsecured loans from three individuals and on convertible debentures held by ten investors other income expenses decreased to  in the third quarter of  from  in the third quarter of  and to  in the first nine months of  from  in the first nine months of  this decrease is due primarily to lower interest expense on the lower level of unsecured loans and convertible debentures and lower accretion of interest in the third quarter and first nine months of  compared to the third quarter and first nine months of  the net income of  in the third quarter of  compared to the net loss of  in the third quarter of  resulted primarily from a higher gross profit on a higher level of revenues in the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  along with lower operating expenses interest expense and accretion of interest in the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  the net income of  in the first nine months of  compared to the net loss of  in the first nine months of  resulted primarily from a higher gross profit on a higher level of revenues lower interest expense and lower accretion of interest in the first nine months of  compared to the first nine months of  offset in part by higher operating expenses in the first nine months of  compared to the first nine months of  plan of operation liquidity and capital resources during the first nine months of  the companys cash increased to  at september   from  at december   during the first nine months of  the company generated  from its operating activities used  for capital equipment and repaid  to an individual lender during the first nine months of  the companys revenues increased primarily as a result of significant sales of ink to a new authorized printer of one of the companys licensees in the entertainment and toy products market and higher license fees from a licensee in the entertainment and toy products market offset in part by lower sales of ink to an existing authorized printer for certain licensees in the entertainment and toy products market the companys operating expenses increased nominally in the first nine months of  compared to operating expenses in the first nine months of  as a result of these factors the company recorded a net profit in the first nine months of  compared to a net loss in the first nine months of  the company had positive operating cash flow of  during the first nine months of  at september   the company had negative working capital of  and a stockholders deficiency of  for the full year of  the company had a net loss of  and had positive operating cash flow of  at december   the company had negative working capital of  and a  stockholders deficiency through september   the company repaid  of  of shortterm loans that had been outstanding at january   in  the company repaid  of convertible debentures and extended the maturity dates of  of convertible debentures from the third quarter of  to the third quarter of  borrowings and sales of common stock in years prior to january   have allowed the company to remain in operation through the current date there can be no assurances that the company will be able to secure sufficient additional funding through investments or borrowings that will allow the company to fund losses that it presently believes may be experienced in the future the company believes that without additional investment it may be forced to cease operations at an undetermined date in the future the companys plan of operation for the twelve months beginning with the date of this quarterly report consists of concentrating available human and financial resources to continue to capitalize on the specific business relationships the company has developed in the entertainment and toy products market including two licensees with a significant presence in the entertainment and toy products market that have been marketing products incorporating the companys technologies since  these two licensees in the entertainment and toy products market are wellknown and highly regarded participants in this market the company believes that these two licensees will continue to expand their offerings incorporating the companys technologies currently being marketed and will introduce new products incorporating available technologies covered by the license agreements that are not currently being marketed by them the company plans to continue developing applications for these licensees while expanding its licensee base in the entertainment and toy market the company has additional licensees marketing or developing products incorporating the companys technologies in certain niche markets of the overall entertainment and toy products market in late  the company added a licensee who the company believes will market products incorporating the companys available technologies in certain international markets in late  or early  the company maintains its presence in the retail loss prevention market and believes that revenue growth in this market could be achieved through increased security ink sales to its licensees in this market the company will continue to adjust its production and technical staff as necessary the company will also subject to available financial resources invest in capital equipment needed to support potential growth in ink production requirements beyond its current capacity additionally the company will pursue opportunities to market its current technologies in specific security and nonsecurity markets there can be no assurances that these efforts will enable the company to generate additional revenues and positive cash flow the company has received and continues to seek additional capital in the form of debt equity or both to support its working capital requirements there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in raising additional capital or that such additional capital if obtained will enable the company to generate additional revenues and positive cash flow the company generates a significant portion of its total revenues from licensees in the entertainment and toy products market these licensees generally sell their products through retail outlets during the year such sales may be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending that may occur as a result of an uncertain economic environment as a result the companys revenues results of operations and liquidity may be negatively impacted as they were in previous years risk factors the companys operating results financial condition and stock price are subject to certain risks some of which are beyond the companys control these risks could cause actual operating and financial results to differ materially from those expressed in the companys forwardlooking statements including the risks described below and the risks identified in other documents which are filed and furnished with the sec including the companys annual report on form k for the year ended december   that was filed with the sec on march   limited interim historical information in september  the company filed a comprehensive annual report on form k for the fiscal years ended december    and  the form k contains summarized quarterly financial information for each of the quarters ended june  and september   and for each of the quarters ended march  june  and september   and  as the complete periodic filings for those periods have not been filed certain financial information disclosures and discussions normally contained in a form q were not included in the form k the omission of the information that would have been contained in these periodic filings leaves current and prospective investors customers employees and others without this source of information about the companys business achievements and prospects and may negatively impact the companys business opportunities and its ability to raise capital there can be no assurances that the company will be able to remain current with its required sec filing obligations in the future access to capital the company anticipates that it may need to raise capital in the future to fund its historical and new business operations negative or uncertain global economic conditions would make it more difficult for the company to raise capital if the company is unable to secure capital if needed in the future in the form debt equity or both it may be forced to cease operations there can be no assurances that if required the company will be successful in obtaining additional investment in sufficient amounts to fund its ongoing business operations dependency on major customers the company is dependent on its licensees to develop new products and markets that will generate increases in its licensing and product revenues the inability of the companys licensees to maintain at least current levels of sales of products utilizing the companys technologies would adversely affect the companys operating results and cash flow to the extent that the companys licensees are affected by negative economic conditions the companys revenues would also be negatively impacted the company derives a significant percentage of its revenues through licensing relationships with two major customers revenues obtained directly from these two licensees and indirectly through the licensees third party authorized printers equaled approximately  and  of the companys revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of  respectively and approximately  of the companys revenues in  receivables from these two licensees and their third party authorized printers were approximately  and  of the companys net accounts receivable at september   and december   respectively the company has a license agreement containing guaranteed minimum royalties expiring in  with one of these two licensees and a license with the second that expires in  products incorporating the companys technologies that are sold by these two licensees have certain dissimilar characteristics and are marketed generally through distinctly different channels of distribution these two licensees are wellknown and highly regarded participants in the entertainment and toy products market the agreements with both licensees contain renewal options but there can be no assurances that the licenses will be renewed or that they will be renewed at the same or more favorable terms beyond their current termination dates nor can there be any assurances that the relationships with these two licensees will generate increased revenues for the company in the future possible inability to develop new business management of the company believes that any significant improvement in the companys cash flow must result from increases in revenues from traditional sources and from new revenue sources the company raised cash through additional capital investment and loans from investors in   and  the company also benefited from limiting increases in its operating expenses and reducing its operating expenses when possible the companys ability to develop new revenues may depend on the extent of its marketing activities and its research and development activities both of which are limited there are no assurances that the resources that the company can devote to marketing and to research and development will be sufficient to increase its revenues to levels that will enable it to maintain positive operating cash flow in the future inability to obtain raw materials and products for resale the companys adverse financial condition in the past has required it to significantly defer payments due to i vendors who supply raw materials and other components of the lines of inks marketed by the company ii providers of professional and other services and iii certain employees to whom salary and sales commissions are owed as a result the company is required to pay cash in advance of shipment to certain of its suppliers the inability to obtain materials on a timely basis and the possibility that certain vendors may permanently discontinue supplying the company with needed products and services threaten to result in delayed shipments to customers and further impact the companys ability to service its customers thereby adversely affecting the companys relationships with its customers and licensees there can be no assurances that the company will be able to maintain its vendor relationships in an acceptable manner uneven pattern of quarterly and annual operating results the companys revenues which are derived primarily from licensing royalties and sales of products incorporating its technologies are difficult to forecast such forecasting difficulty is due to among other reasons the long sales cycle of the companys technologies the potential for customer delay or deferral of implementation of the companys technologies the size and timing of inception of individual license agreements the success of the companys licensees and strategic partners in exploiting the market for the licensed products modifications of customer budgets and uneven patterns of royalty revenue and product orders as the companys revenue base is not substantial delays in finalizing license contracts implementing the technology to initiate the revenue stream and ordering decisions of customers can have a material adverse effect on the companys quarterly and annual revenue expectations as the    nov   c  cybernet

companys audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the companys annual report on form k for the year ended december   filed with the securities and exchange commission the sec on march   and keeping in mind this cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking information results of operations the companys revenues are derived from i royalties paid by licensees of the companys technologies ii fees for the provision of technical services to licensees and iii the direct sale of a products incorporating the companys technologies such as inks security paper and pressure sensitive labels and b equipment used to support the application of the companys technologies such as inkjet printing systems royalties consist of guaranteed minimum royalties payable by the companys licensees andor additional royalties which typically vary with the licensees sales or production of products incorporating the licensed technology technical services in the form of onsite or telephone consultations by members of the companys technical staff may be offered to licensees of the companys technologies the consulting fees are billed at agreed upon per diem or hourly rates at the time the services are rendered service fees and sales revenues vary directly with the number of units of service or product provided the company recognizes revenue on its lines of business as follows a license fees and royalties are recognized when the license term begins upon inception of the license term revenue is recognized in a manner consistent with the nature of the transaction and the earnings process which generally is ratably over the license term b product sales are recognized i upon shipment of products ii when the price is fixed or determinable and iii when collectability is reasonably assured and c fees for technical services are recognized when i the service has been rendered ii an arrangement exists iii the price is fixed or determinable based upon a per diem or hourly rate and iv collectability is reasonably assured    the company believes that as fixed cost reductions beyond those it has achieved in recent years may not be achievable its operating results are substantially dependent on revenue levels because revenues derived from licenses and royalties carry a much higher gross profit margin than other revenues operating results are also substantially affected by changes in revenue mix both the absolute amounts of the companys revenues and the mix among the various sources of revenue are subject to substantial fluctuation the company has a relatively small number of substantial customers rather than a large number of small customers accordingly changes in the revenue received from a significant customer can have a substantial effect on the companys total revenue and on its revenue mix and overall financial performance such changes may result from a customers product development delays engineering changes changes in product marketing strategies and the like in addition certain customers have from time to time sought to renegotiate certain provisions of their license agreements and when the company agrees to revise terms revenues from the customer may be affected the addition of a substantial new customer or the loss of a substantial existing customer may also have a substantial effect on the companys total revenue revenue mix and operating results revenues for the third quarter of  were  compared to  in the third quarter of  an increase of  or approximately  licenses royalties and fees increased by  or approximately  to  in the third quarter of  from  in the third quarter of  the increase in licenses royalties and fees is due primarily to higher quarterly licensing revenues from an existing licensee in the entertainment and toy products market who signed a new fouryear license late in the second quarter of  along with higher royalties from certain licensees including one new licensee there can be no assurances that the marketing and product development activities of the companys licensees or other businesses in the entertainment and toy products market will produce sustained increases in revenues for the company nor can the timing of any potential revenue increases be predicted particularly given the uncertain economic conditions being experienced worldwide product and other sales increased by  or approximately  to  in the third quarter of  from  in the third quarter of  sales of ink increased in the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  due primarily to a significant volume of ink shipped in the third quarter of  to a new third party authorized printer used by one of the companys major licensees in the entertainment and toy products market offset in part by lower ink shipments to the companys licensees in the retail receipt and document fraud market in the third quarter of  the company derived revenues of approximately  from its licensees and their authorized printers in the entertainment and toy products market compared to revenues of approximately  in the third quarter of  for the first nine months of  revenues were  representing an increase of  or approximately  higher than revenues of  in the first nine months of  licenses royalties and fees of  in the first nine months of  were  or approximately  higher than licenses royalties and fees of  in the first nine months of  the increase in licenses royalties and fees in the first nine months of  compared to the first nine months of  is due primarily to higher licensing revenues from existing licensees in the entertainment and toy products market product and other sales increased by  or approximately  to  in the first nine months of  from  in the first nine months of  sales of ink increased in the first nine months of  compared to the first nine months of  due primarily to a higher volume of ink shipped to the third party authorized printers used by two of the companys major licensees in the entertainment and toy products market offset in part by lower ink shipments to the companys licensees in the retail receipt and document fraud market the company derived revenues of approximately  from licensees and their authorized printers in the entertainment and toy products market in the first nine months of  compared to revenues of approximately  in the first nine months of  the companys gross profit increased to  in the third quarter of  or approximately  of revenues from  in the third quarter of  or approximately  of revenues licenses royalties and fees have historically carried a higher gross profit than product and other sales such other sales generally consist of supplies or other manufactured products which incorporate the companys technologies or equipment used to support the application of its technologies these items except for inks which are manufactured by the company are generally purchased from thirdparty vendors and resold to the enduser or licensee and carry a lower gross profit than licenses royalties and fees the higher gross profit in the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  results primarily from higher gross revenues from licenses royalties and fees and from product and other sales in the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of     for the first nine months of  gross profit was  or approximately  of revenues compared to  or approximately  of revenues in the first nine months of  the higher gross profit in the first nine months of  compared to the first nine months of  results from the same positive factors as the increase in the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  as the variable component of cost of revenues related to licenses royalties and fees is a low percentage of these revenues and the fixed component is not substantial period to period changes in revenues from licenses royalties and fees can significantly affect both the gross profit from licenses royalties and fees as well as overall gross profit primarily due to higher revenues from licenses royalties and fees in the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  the gross profit from licenses royalties and fees increased to approximately  of revenues in the third quarter of  from approximately  of revenues in the third quarter of  the gross profit from licenses royalties and fees was approximately  in the first nine months of  compared to approximately  in first nine months of  resulting from the same factors as the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  the gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues of product and other sales is dependent on both the overall sales volumes of product and other sales and on the mix of the specific goods produced andor sold the gross profit from product and other sales decreased to approximately  of revenues in the third quarter of  compared to approximately  of revenues in the third quarter of  this decrease in the gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to a change in mix of products sold during the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  for the first nine months of  the gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenues decreased to approximately  of revenues from product and other sales compared to approximately  of revenues from product and other sales in the first nine months of  research and development expenses of  in the third quarter of  and  in the first nine months of  were comparable to  in the third quarter of  and  in the first nine months of  sales and marketing expenses increased to  in the third quarter of  from  in the third quarter of  and to  in the first nine months of  from  in the first nine months of  this increase is due primarily to higher commission expense on the higher level of sales in the third quarter and first nine months of  compared to the third quarter and first nine months of  general and administrative expenses decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of  to  and  respectively from  and  in the third quarter and first nine months of  respectively due primarily to lower legal and audit expenses incurred in the third quarter and first nine months of  compared to the third quarter and first nine months of  in the third quarter of  the company incurred significant expenses related to the filing of the comprehensive annual report on form k and the first and second quarter  form qs that were filed during the third quarter of  these expenses included legal and audit fees in the third quarter and first nine months of  as well as expenses related to the electronic filing of the documents other income expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of  and  included interest on unsecured loans from three individuals and on convertible debentures held by ten investors other income expenses decreased to  in the third quarter of  from  in the third quarter of  and to  in the first nine months of  from  in the first nine months of  this decrease is due primarily to lower interest expense on the lower level of unsecured loans and convertible debentures and lower accretion of interest in the third quarter and first nine months of  compared to the third quarter and first nine months of  the net income of  in the third quarter of  compared to the net loss of  in the third quarter of  resulted primarily from a higher gross profit on a higher level of revenues in the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  along with lower operating expenses interest expense and accretion of interest in the third quarter of  compared to the third quarter of  the net income of  in the first nine months of  compared to the net loss of  in the first nine months of  resulted primarily from a higher gross profit on a higher level of revenues lower interest expense and lower accretion of interest in the first nine months of  compared to the first nine months of  offset in part by higher operating expenses in the first nine months of  compared to the first nine months of     plan of operation liquidity and capital resources during the first nine months of  the companys cash increased to  at september   from  at december   during the first nine months of  the company generated  from its operating activities used  for capital equipment and repaid  to an individual lender during the first nine months of  the companys revenues increased primarily as a result of significant sales of ink to a new authorized printer of one of the companys licensees in the entertainment and toy products market and higher license fees from a licensee in the entertainment and toy products market offset in part by lower sales of ink to an existing authorized printer for certain licensees in the entertainment and toy products market the companys operating expenses increased nominally in the first nine months of  compared to operating expenses in the first nine months of  as a result of these factors the company recorded a net profit in the first nine months of  compared to a net loss in the first nine months of  the company had positive operating cash flow of  during the first nine months of  at september   the company had negative working capital of  and a stockholders deficiency of  for the full year of  the company had a

shortterm loans that had been outstanding at january   in  the company repaid  of convertible debentures and extended the maturity dates of  of convertible debentures from the third quarter of  to the third quarter of  borrowings and sales of common stock in years prior to january   have allowed the company to remain in operation through the current date there can be no assurances that the company will be able to secure sufficient additional funding through investments or borrowings that will allow the company to fund losses that it presently believes may be experienced in the future the company believes that without additional investment it may be forced to cease operations at an undetermined date in the future the companys plan of operation for the twelve months beginning with the date of this quarterly report consists of concentrating available human and financial resources to continue to capitalize on the specific business relationships the company has developed in the entertainment and toy products market including two licensees with a significant presence in the entertainment and toy products market that have been marketing products incorporating the companys technologies since  these two licensees in the entertainment and toy products market are wellknown and highly regarded participants in this market the company believes that these two licensees will continue to expand their offerings incorporating the companys technologies currently being marketed and will introduce new products incorporating available technologies covered by the license agreements that are not currently being marketed by them the company plans to continue developing applications for these licensees while expanding its licensee base in the entertainment and toy market the company has additional licensees marketing or developing products incorporating the companys technologies in certain niche markets of the overall entertainment and toy products market in late  the company added a licensee who the company believes will market products incorporating the companys available technologies in certain international markets in late  or early  the company maintains its presence in the retail loss prevention market and believes that revenue growth in this market could be achieved through increased security ink sales to its licensees in this market the company will continue to adjust its production and technical staff as necessary the company will also subject to available financial resources invest in capital equipment needed to support potential growth in ink production requirements beyond its current capacity additionally the company will pursue opportunities to market its current technologies in specific security and nonsecurity markets there can be no assurances that these efforts will enable the company to generate additional revenues and positive cash flow the company has received and continues to seek additional capital in the form of debt equity or both to support its working capital requirements there can be no assurances that the company will be successful in raising additional capital or that such additional capital if obtained will enable the company to generate additional revenues and positive cash flow the company generates a significant portion of its total revenues from licensees in the entertainment and toy products market these licensees generally sell their products through retail outlets during the year such sales may be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending that may occur as a result of an uncertain economic environment as a result the companys revenues results of operations and liquidity may be negatively impacted as they were in previous years    risk factors the companys operating results financial condition and stock price are subject to certain risks some of which are beyond the companys control these risks could cause actual operating and financial results to differ materially from those expressed in the companys forwardlooking statements including the risks described below and the risks identified in other documents which are filed and furnished with the sec including the companys annual report on form k for the year ended december   that was filed with the sec on march   limited interim historical information in september  the company filed a comprehensive annual report on form k for the fiscal years ended december    and  the form k contains summarized quarterly financial information for each of the quarters ended june  and september   and for each of the quarters ended march  june  and september   and  as the complete periodic filings for those periods have not been filed certain financial information disclosures and discussions normally contained in a form q were not included in the form k the omission of the information that would have been contained in these periodic filings leaves current and prospective investors customers employees and others without this source of information about the companys business achievements and prospects and may negatively impact the companys business opportunities and its ability to raise capital there can be no assurances that the company will be able to remain current with its required sec filing obligations in the future access to capital the company anticipates that it may need to raise capital in the future to fund its historical and new business operations negative or uncertain global economic conditions would make it more difficult for the company to raise capital if the company is unable to secure capital if needed in the future in the form debt equity or both it may be forced to cease operations there can be no assurances that if required the company will be successful in obtaining additional investment in sufficient amounts to fund its ongoing business operations dependency on major customers the company is dependent on its licensees to develop new products and markets that will generate increases in its licensing and product revenues the inability of the companys licensees to maintain at least current levels of sales of products utilizing the companys technologies would adversely affect the companys operating results and cash flow to the extent that the companys licensees are affected by negative economic conditions the companys revenues would also be negatively impacted the company derives a significant percentage of its revenues through licensing relationships with two major customers revenues obtained directly from these two licensees and indirectly through the licensees third party authorized printers equaled approximately  and  of the companys revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of  respectively and approximately  of the companys revenues in  receivables from these two licensees and their third party authorized printers were approximately  and  of the companys net accounts receivable at september   and december   respectively the company has a license agreement containing guaranteed minimum royalties expiring in  with one of these two licensees and a license with the second that expires in  products incorporating the companys technologies that are sold by these two licensees have certain dissimilar characteristics and are marketed generally through distinctly different channels of distribution these two licensees are wellknown and highly regarded participants in the entertainment and toy products market the agreements with both licensees contain renewal options but there can be no assurances that the licenses will be renewed or that they will be renewed at the same or more favorable terms beyond their current termination dates nor can there be any assurances that the relationships with these two licensees will generate increased revenues for the company in the future possible inability to develop new business  management of the company believes that any significant improvement in the companys cash flow must result from increases in revenues from traditional sources and from new revenue sources the company raised cash through additional capital investment and loans from investors in   and  the company also benefited from limiting increases in its operating expenses and reducing its operating expenses when possible the companys ability to develop new revenues may depend on the extent of its marketing activities and its research and development activities both of which are limited there are no assurances that the resources that the company can devote to marketing and to research and development will be sufficient to increase its revenues to levels that will enable it to maintain positive operating cash flow in the future    inability to obtain raw materials and products for resale the companys adverse financial condition in the past has required it to significantly defer payments due to i vendors who supply raw materials and other components of the lines of inks marketed by the company ii providers of professional and other services and iii certain employees to whom salary and sales commissions are owed as a result the company is required to pay cash in advance of shipment to certain of its suppliers the inability to obtain materials on a timely basis and the possibility that certain vendors may permanently discontinue supplying the company with needed products and services threaten to result in delayed shipments to customers and further impact the companys ability to service its customers thereby adversely affecting the companys relationships with its customers and licensees there can be no assurances that the company will be able to maintain its vendor relationships in an acceptable manner uneven pattern of quarterly and annual operating results  the companys revenues which are derived primarily from licensing royalties and sales of products incorporating its technologies are difficult to forecast such forecasting difficulty is due to among other reasons  the long sales cycle of the companys technologies the potential for customer delay or deferral of implementation of the companys technologies the size and timing of inception of individual license agreements the success of the companys licensees and strategic partners in exploiting the market for the licensed products modifications of customer budgets and uneven patterns of royalty revenue and product orders as the companys revenue base is not substantial delays in finalizing license contracts implementing the technology to initiate the revenue stream and ordering decisions of customers can have a material adverse effect on the companys quarterly and annual revenue expectations as the companys operating expenses are substantially fixed income expectations will be subject to a similar adverse outcome as licensees for the entertainment and toy products markets are added the predictability of the companys revenue stream may be further impacted volatility of stock price  the market price for the companys common stock has historically experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to do so from inception with the exception of   and  the company has operated at a loss and has not produced revenue levels traditionally associated with publiclytraded companies the companys common stock is not listed on a national or regional securities exchange and consequently the company receives limited publicity regarding its business achievements and prospects additionally securities analysts and traders do not extensively follow the companys stock and its stock is thinly traded the companys market price may be affected by announcements of new relationships or modifications to existing relationships the stock prices of many developing public companies particularly those with small capitalizations have experienced wide fluctuations not necessarily related to operating performance such fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the companys common stock intellectual property the company relies on a combination of protections as may be available under applicable domestic foreign or international patent trademark and trade secret laws the company also relies on confidentiality nonanalysis and licensing agreements to establish and protect its rights in its proprietary technologies while the company attempts to protect these rights its technologies may be compromised through reverse engineering independent invention or other means in addition the companys ability to enforce its intellectual property rights through appropriate legal action has been and will continue to be limited by its adverse liquidity there can be no assurances that the company will be able to protect the basis of its technologies from discovery by third parties or to preclude third parties from conducting activities that infringe on the companys rights the companys adverse liquidity situation also impacts its ability to obtain patent protection on its intellectual property and to maintain protection on previously issued patents there can be no assurances that the company will be able to continue to prosecute new patents and maintain issued patents as a result the companys customer and licensee relationships could be adversely affected and the value of the companys technologies and intellectual property including their value upon liquidation could be substantially diminished economic conditions  the companys revenue is susceptible to changes in general economic conditions the companys sales liquidity and overall results of operations may be negatively affected by decreasing consumer confidence slowdowns in consumer spending or other downturns in the us economy as a whole or in any geographic markets from which the company derives revenue in addition these factors may result in decreased customer and licensee demand for the companys products and may negatively impact the companys ability to develop new customers and licensees due to uncertainties surrounding the worldwide economy the company is unable to predict the effect of such conditions on its customers and licensees consequently the company cannot predict the scope or magnitude of the negative effect
