prospectus is being registered for the account of the selling stockholders we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling stockholders telehealth has created its own ecosystem and the primary parts of the ecosystem are based on technology including peripheral device suppliers and gateway suppliers  health hubs and mobile gateways in addition to data transmission service providers  cellular and broadband there are several companies offering the exact same services as the company almost all of these companies have substantially greater capital and marketing resources and greater experience in commercializing products and services than we have as the industry defines itself suppliers in different segments of the ecosystem are collaborating however as the market changes competition between suppliers will increase the market primarily consists of three types of entities they are  data transmission suppliers which provide information exchange technology for telehealth systems mobile and internet  gateway suppliers which provide telehealth hubs and user platforms  peripheral device suppliers which provide remote monitoring devices  such as blood pressure monitors and glucose meters used in conjunction with telehealth services competition will increase as these entities expand the types of services they provide through improved choices new competition brings with it the real possibility of higher quality and lowered costs this increased competition also presents a challenge to providers health systems and regulators used to traditional delivery systems many feel threatened resistance to the growth of telemedicine can be attributed in part to the fear of competition nevertheless consumer choice and competition flourish when barriers to access and innovation are removed this creates an opportunity for profitable relationships between gateways and peripheral suppliers company description telemedicine and virtual medicine are interchangeable terms often described under the heading of “telehealth” referring to the use of electronic communication and information technologies to provide or support clinical care at a distance telehealth being the broadest of these terms is often used to refer to a diverse group of healthrelated activities wadena is developing a fixed digital gateway presence for telehealth services through a diverse marketing strategy that highlights evisits for doctor patient interaction on august   the company signed an agreement with new benefits inc to become one of its independent sales representatives wadena intends to offer membership to healthcare benefits packages as a reseller for new benefits inc under its own private label the service offered connects individuals with

internet as well as providing other types of administrative services and information all of the participating providers have independently contracted to be in a network operated by new benefits inc wadena does not provide any physicians’ or other providers’ services itself our services enable access to providers who have agreed to provide patient care to customers using our system wadena service consists of a telemedicine feature wadena arranges for the provision of care we do not provide medical care nor does new benefits new benefits is a leader in noninsured health personal security and

doctor  through their telephone computer smartphone or tablet to obtain a quick diagnosis andor treatment options from a us licensed physician new benefits contracts with us boardcertified doctors

merchant accounts and take credit cards over the phone and on the internet for the memberships it sells fulfillment is provided by our contracted direct medical provider organization “dmpo” new benefits inc the company’s business model enables it to leverage the expertise of its management who is a seasoned e commerce and direct marketer it is intended for phase  to provide wadena with the knowledge information and firmly position the company to generate revenue under the dmpo model which at this time is the most profitable channel for these services primarily offered through employee benefits programs as a new age healthcare company wadena will create value for patients physicians and payment systems through telemedicine services as a result of the increasing digital transformation in healthcare we will be able to address some of the challenges facing healthcare today recognizing a diversity of services provided in healthcare that present complications the healthcare industry represents approximately  of the us economy this is important given the extent of government involvement with healthcare for the elderly and the poor through medicare and medicaid cost access and convenience present difficulties for patients who need care the doctors who provide it and how it is paid for some of these problems can be alleviated through the use of telemedicine convenience is a driving force behind the growing popularity of telehealth services however the ability to deliver care at a lower cost is ultimately what will determine success lower overhead is the primary factor that allows for a lower cost this is attractive both to patients and physicians wadena will collect fees from every physicianpatient interaction wadena has chosen to enter this market at the perfect time as digital technology is able to rapidly increase its application in the healthcare industry in addition to the obvious increase in ease of use wadena will be able to provide comfort and desire for interaction with physicians in a more convenient cost effective way the terms “fixed digital gateway presence” and “fixed digital gateway for telehealth services and internet interface” are interchangeable used in context and do not relate directly to the product we intend to sell initially one is more descriptive than the other describing the fact there will be a website
