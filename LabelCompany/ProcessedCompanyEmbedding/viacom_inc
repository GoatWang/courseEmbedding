viacom filed a us billion legal claim viacom international inc v youtube inc against google and youtube alleging massive copyright infringement alleging that users frequently uploaded copyrighted material to youtube—enough to cause a hit in revenue for viacom and a gain in advertisement revenue for youtube the complaint contended that almost  unauthorized clips of viacoms programming were made available on youtube and that these clips had collectively been viewed more than  billion times in july  the case generated controversy when district judge louis stanton ruled that youtube was required to hand over data detailing the viewing habits of every user who had ever watched videos on the site judge stanton rejected viacoms request for youtube to hand over the source code of its search engine system saying that the code was a trade secret google and viacom later agreed to allow google to anonymize all the data before handing it over to viacom on june   judge stanton ruled in googles favor in a motion for summary judgment holding that google was protected by provisions of the digital millennium copyright act notwithstanding evidence of intentional copyright infringement viacom announced its intention to appeal the ruling on april   the ruling was overturned by the united states court of appeals for the second circuit writing for a twojudge panel because judge roger miner had died while the trial was pending of the second circuit judge josé a cabranes concluded that a reasonable jury could find that youtube had actual knowledge or awareness of specific infringing activity on its website eric goldman a professor at the santa clara university school of law expressed concern that the ruling would negatively affect startups by making them more hairtrigger on taking down news or content for fear that failure to do so will be held against them by content providers viacom internationaledit main article viacom international as with the old viacom the current

copyright infringement on march   viacom filed a us billion legal claim viacom international inc v youtube inc against google and youtube alleging massive copyright infringement alleging that users frequently uploaded copyrighted material to youtube—enough to cause a hit in revenue for viacom and a gain in advertisement revenue for youtube the complaint contended that almost  unauthorized clips of viacoms programming were made available on youtube and that these clips had collectively been viewed more than  billion times in july  the case generated controversy when district judge louis stanton ruled that youtube was required to hand over data detailing the viewing habits of every user who had ever watched videos on the site judge stanton rejected viacoms request for youtube to hand over the source code of its search engine system saying that the code was a trade secret google and viacom later agreed to allow google to anonymize all the data before handing it over to viacom on june   judge stanton ruled in googles favor in a motion for summary judgment holding that google was protected by provisions of the digital millennium copyright act notwithstanding evidence of intentional copyright infringement viacom announced its intention to appeal the ruling on april   the ruling was overturned by the united states court of appeals for the second circuit writing for a twojudge panel because judge roger miner had died while the trial was pending of the second circuit judge josé a cabranes concluded that a reasonable jury could find that youtube had actual knowledge or awareness of specific infringing activity on its website eric goldman a professor at the santa clara university school of law expressed concern that the ruling would negatively affect startups by

gain in advertisement revenue for youtube the complaint contended that almost  unauthorized clips of viacoms programming were made available on youtube and that these clips had collectively been viewed more than  billion times in july  the case generated controversy when district judge louis stanton ruled that youtube was required to hand over data detailing the viewing habits of every user who had ever watched videos on the site judge stanton rejected viacoms request for youtube to hand over the source code of its search engine system saying that the code was a trade secret google and viacom later agreed to allow google to anonymize all the data before handing it over to viacom on june   judge stanton ruled in googles favor in a motion for summary judgment holding that google was protected by provisions of the digital millennium copyright act notwithstanding evidence of intentional copyright infringement viacom announced its intention to appeal the ruling on april   the ruling was overturned by the united states court of appeals for the second circuit writing for a twojudge panel because judge roger miner had died while the trial was pending of the second circuit judge josé a cabranes concluded that a reasonable jury could find that youtube had actual knowledge or awareness of specific infringing activity on its website eric goldman a professor at the santa clara

objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump

unauthorized clips of viacoms programming were made available on youtube and that these clips had collectively been viewed more than  billion times in july  the case generated controversy when district judge louis stanton ruled that youtube was required to hand over data detailing the viewing habits of every user who had ever watched videos on the site judge stanton rejected viacoms request
