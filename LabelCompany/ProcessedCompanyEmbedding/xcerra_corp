company profile about xcerra corporation enabling our customers to win with affordable and reliable products handling contacting and measurement solutions innovative and cost effective products our mission is to create and deliver the most innovative and cost effective handling contacting and measurements solutions to the electronics industry enabling our customers to win with affordable and reliable products that continuously improve people‘s lives xcerra corporation is the parent company of four powerful brands that have been supplying innovative products and services to the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing industry for more than  years xcerra’s four brands are atgluther  maelzer everett charles technologies ltxcredence and multitest xcerra corporation was formed in  following the ltxcredence acquisition of everett charles technologies ect and multitest from dover corporation in december of  the strategic vision of the ltxcredence management team in making these acquisitions was to build a company with a greater share of the semiconductor test cell market acquiring these assets allowed the company to achieve this goalas well as expand into additional vertical markets related to printed circuit board test and test fixtures a key component of the long term growth strategy for xcerra is to offer differentiated semiconductor test products and services that include providing customers a fully integrated test cell solution directly to their production floor this strategy allows customers to procure key components of the test cell such as the tester handler contactors and interface boards from a single supplier and to take delivery of a turnkey solution directly into their high volume manufacturing environment this strategy reduces risk for the customer associated with doing the test cell integration themselves and has the added benefit of accelerating their ability to get new products to market faster  even as the company offers new products and services for an entire test cell solution each brand is still chartered with developing bestinclass products for the markets they serve customers have the flexibility to purchase one of xcerra’s products or an entire test cell solution  either way our customers receive the same level of attention and support from xcerra while the semiconductor capital equipment market is the largest driver of xcerra’s business the acquisition of everett charles technologies expanded the company into vertical markets associated with pcb testing within ect there is another business atg luther  maelzer atglm has been in business for more than  years providing test systems for bare board pcb test after a printed circuited board has been manufactured atglm testers are used to verify point to point continuity there are two different types of test technology applied to bare board pcb testing universal grid and flying probe atglm has a leadership position in the flying probe tester market ect also provides fixture design development and fabrication services for the incircuit and functional test of assembled pcbs ect provides these services on a global basis and is the market leader ect also markets a wide range of pins and compliant connectors used in many different types of test applications but also in market segments completely outside of test   measured by the customer’s success as a new company xcerra corporation offers a broad range of products and services to the semiconductor and printed circuit board test markets it has a global service and support network designed to be highly responsive to customer needs regardless of location or time our primary goal as a company is simply to help our customers succeed we accomplish that goal by developing innovative products and services and delivering them through our global sales and support network second to none   xcra stock price  xcerra corp stock quote us nasdaq  marketwatch sections watchlist

mission is to create and deliver the most innovative and cost effective handling contacting and measurements solutions to the electronics industry enabling our customers to win with affordable and reliable products that continuously improve people‘s lives xcerra corporation is the parent company of four powerful brands that have been supplying innovative products and services to the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing industry for more than  years xcerra’s four brands are atgluther  maelzer everett charles technologies ltxcredence and multitest xcerra corporation was formed in  following the ltxcredence acquisition of everett charles technologies ect and multitest from dover corporation in december of  the strategic vision of the ltxcredence management team in making these acquisitions was to build a company with a greater share of the semiconductor test cell market acquiring these assets allowed the company to achieve this goal as well as expand into additional vertical markets related to printed circuit board test and test fixtures a key component of the long term growth strategy for xcerra is to offer differentiated semiconductor test products and services that include providing customers a fully integrated test cell solution directly to their production floor this strategy allows customers to procure key components of the test cell such as the tester handler contactors and interface boards from a single supplier and to take delivery of a turnkey solution directly into their highvolume manufacturing environment this strategy reduces risk for the customer associated with doing the test cell integration themselves and has the added benefit of accelerating their ability to get new products to market faster four powerful brands joined solutions and dedicated products even as the company offers new products and services for an entire test cell solution each brand is still chartered with developing bestinclass products for the markets they serve customers have the flexibility to purchase one of xcerra’s products or an entire test cell solution  either way our customers receive the same level of attention and support from xcerra while the semiconductor capital equipment market is the largest driver of xcerra’s business the acquisition of everett charles technologies expanded the company into vertical markets associated with pcb testing within ect there is another business atg luther  maelzer atglm has been in business for more than  years providing test systems for bare board pcb test after a printed circuited board has been manufactured atglm testers are used to verify point to point continuity there are two different types of test technology applied to bare board pcb testing universal grid and flying probe atglm has a leadership position in the flying probe tester market ect also provides fixture design development and fabrication services for the incircuit and functional test of assembled pcbs ect provides these services on a global basis and is the market leader ect also markets a wide range of pins and compliant connectors used in many different types of test applications but also in market segments completely outside of test measured by our customer’s success xcerra corporation offers a broad range of products and services to the semiconductor and printed circuit board test markets it

multitest is currently the only company offering this kind of advanced technology for gravity handlers with this development multitest is responding to the market need for temperature testing of large devices where soak time closely correlates with throughput  and as a result impacts the cost of test highvolume production test of automotive devices is one market that benefits from this enhanced soak booster capability whereas the industry standard for gravity handling is thermal heat transfer by radiation from track to device soak booster uses convection as transfer principle the temperature
