intersections incs product identity guard is advertising at the huffington post whose religious propaganda is offensive to christians and jews home    about us    contact us    donate    email alerts    accomplishments intersections incs product identity guard is advertising at the huffington post whose religious propaganda is offensive to christians and jews   the email for this article was deactivated after intersections inc stopped advertising the huffington post published an article on apri   titled did jesus predict muhammad a biblical portal between christianity and islam  the article states in part the time has come for christians and muslims to make peace between our communities our planet simply cannot afford another century of misunderstanding and violence between these two communities in an earlier blog on the huffington post about the problem of christian islamophobia i argue that christians have the opportunity to transform the way we see islam and muslims by accepting muhammad as “spirit of truth” historically most christian theologians—including john of damascus thomas aquinas dante nicholas of cusa and martin luther—have seen muhammad not as a “spirit of truth” but as a “spirit of error” a false prophet or heretic there are many christians today who respect the islamic tradition and would never make such an offensive statement about muhammad however the majority of christians still maintain a fundamentally islamophobic position on muhammad so i believe that the time has come for peacemaking christians to contradict this position directly changing our view of muhammad—so that we recognize him as a true prophet rather than discredit him as a false prophet—would effectively inoculate christians against islamophobia and would help to establish a new paradigm of cooperative christianmuslim relations … there is no better candidate than muhammad no one in fact that comes even close in terms of fulfilling jesus’s promise of the spirit of truth who would bring forth a new revelation from god i do not have space in this article to explore the many qur’anic verses directly addressed to christians but if we were to receive them our religion would be transformed for the better and would come into balance with judaism and islam click here to read the full article the huffington post article •    erroneously blames alleged christian islamophobia for the worldwide conflict between muslims and infidels •    dangerously perverts the holy scriptures of the bible to falsely elevate muhammad to a judaic christian status •    tragically ignores the millions of muslims around the world who support the killing of hundreds of thousands of christians  the religionofpeacecom provides a detailed report of muslims killing christians  while muslims are killing hundreds of thousands of christians around the world the huffington post article has the audacity to write “our planet simply cannot afford another century of misunderstanding and violence between these two communities” what violence do christians appear to be committing against muslims suggested by the huffington post article  that would be islamophobia which is the term that is used to harshly label and intimidate people out of their rational fact based concern that islamists use violence and sharia law to advance their political agenda thereligionofpeacecom reported on may   islamic terrorists have carried out more than  deadly terror attacks since  jihad report last  days attacks              killed            injured            suicide blasts      countries             weekly report may   thru may   attacks               killed             injured             suicide blasts     countries               yet the huffington post article has the audacity to blame islamophobic christians for the worldwide conflict between muslims and infidels jihadwatchorg reports the following regarding this issue jesus is not the son of god belief in the trinity is “excess” “o people of the scripture do not commit excess in your religion or say about allah except the truth the messiah jesus the son of mary was but a messenger of allah and his word which he directed to mary and a soul from him so believe in allah and his messengers and do not say ‘three’ desist — it is better for you indeed allah is but one god exalted is he above having a son to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and sufficient is allah as disposer of affairs” — qur’an “it is not befitting to the majesty of allah that he should beget a son glory be to him when he determines a matter he only says to it ‘be’ and it is” — qur’an  jesus was not crucified “and because of their saying we slew the messiah jesus son of mary allah’s messenger — they slew him not nor crucified him but it appeared so unto them and lo those who disagree concerning it are in doubt thereof they have no knowledge thereof save pursuit of a conjecture they slew him not for certain” — qur’an  those who believe in the divinity of christ are “disbelievers” “they have certainly disbelieved who say that allah is christ the son of mary” — qur’an  christians “forgot a good part” of the divine revelations they received “from those too who call themselves christians we did take a covenant but they forgot a good part of the message that was sent them so we estranged them with enmity and hatred between the one and the other to the day of judgment and soon will allah show them what it is they have done” — qur’an  muslims should not take jews or christians as friends “o you who believe do not take the jews and the christians for friends they are friends of each other and whoever amongst you takes them for a friend then surely he is one of them surely allah does not guide the unjust people” — qur’an  those who believe that jesus is god’s son are accursed “the jews call ezra a son of allah and the christians call christ the son of allah that is a saying from their mouth they but imitate what the unbelievers of old used to say allah’s curse be on them how they are deluded away from the truth ” — qur’an  christians who do not become muslims “are the most vile of created beings” “nor did those who were given the scripture become divided until after there had come to them clear evidence and they were not commanded except to worship allah sincere to him in religion inclining to truth and to establish prayer and to give zakah and that is the correct religion indeed they who disbelieved among the people of the scripture and the polytheists will be in the fire of hell abiding eternally therein those are the most vile of created beings” — qur’an  jesus’ mission was to proclaim the coming of muhammad “and when jesus the son of mary said ‘o children of israel indeed i am the messenger of allah to you confirming what came before me of the torah and bringing good tidings of a messenger to come after me whose name is ahmad’ but when he came to them with clear evidences they said ‘this is obvious magic’” — qur’an  muslims must fight against and subjugate christians “fight those who believe not in allah nor the last day nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by allah and his messenger nor acknowledge the religion of truth even if they are of the people of the book until they pay the jizya with willing submission and feel themselves subdued” — qur’an  christianity is incompatible with islam  the huffington post article perverts bible scriptures and hides what the qur’an states about christians and

measures the table below includes financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “gaap” as well as other financial measures referred to as nongaap financial measures consolidated adjusted ebitda before share related compensation and noncash impairment charges “adjusted ebitda” is presented in a manner consistent with the way management evaluates operating results and which management believes is useful to investors and others share related compensation includes noncash share based compensation an explanation regarding the company’s use of nongaap financial measures and a reconciliation of nongaap financial measures used by the company to gaap measures is provided below these nongaap financial measures should be considered in addition to but not as a substitute for net income loss and the other information prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure consolidated adjusted ebitda represents consolidated loss before income taxes plus share related compensation noncash impairment of goodwill intangibles and other assets gain loss on disposal of fixed assets adjustment for surplus and obsolete inventories depreciation and amortization and interest income expense we believe that the consolidated adjusted ebitda calculation provides useful information to investors because they are indicators of our operating performance and we use these measures in communications with our board of directors creditors investors and others concerning our financial performance consolidated adjusted ebitda is commonly used as a basis for investors and analysts to evaluate and compare the periodic and future operating performance and value of companies within our industry our board of directors and management use consolidated adjusted ebitda to evaluate the operating performance of the company in addition consolidated adjusted ebitda as defined in our prior credit agreement with crystal financial llc and our new credit agreement with peak investments lp is used to measure covenant compliance we provide this information to show the impact of share related compensation on our operating results as it is excluded from our internal operating and budgeting plans and measurements of financial performance however we do consider the dilutive impact to our shareholders when awarding share related compensation and consider both the blackscholes value and gaap value to the extent applicable in connection therewith and value such awards accordingly intersections incother data continuedunaudited we do not consider share related compensation charges when we evaluate the performance of our individual business groups or formulate our short and longterm operating plans due to its nature individual managers generally are unable to project the impact of share related compensation and accordingly we do not hold them accountable for the impact of equity award grants when we consider making share related compensation grants we primarily take into account the need to attract and retain high quality employees overall shareholder dilution and the blackscholes values of the equity grant to the recipient rather than the potential accounting charges associated with such grants for comparability purposes we believe it is useful to provide a nongaap financial measure that excludes share related compensation in order to better understand the longterm performance of our core business and to compare our results to the results of our peer companies because of varying available valuation methodologies and the variety of award types that companies can use under gaap furthermore the value of share related compensation is determined using a complex formula that incorporates factors such as market volatility that are beyond our control accordingly we believe that the presentation of consolidated adjusted ebitda when read in conjunction with our reported gaap results can provide useful supplemental information to our management to investors and to our lenders regarding financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations consolidated adjusted ebitda has limitations due to the fact it does not include all compensation related expenses for example if we only paid cash based compensation as opposed to a portion in share related compensation the cash compensation expense included in our general and administrative expenses would be higher we compensate for this limitation by providing information required by gaap about outstanding share based awards in the footnotes to our financial statements in our sec filings we believe equity based compensation is an important element of our compensation program and all forms of share related awards are valued and included as appropriate in our operating results the following table reconciles core business voyce and consolidated income loss before income taxes to consolidated adjusted ebitda as defined for the previous five quarters through march   in managing our business we analyze our performance quarterly on a consolidated income loss before income tax basis in the second quarter of  we ceased adding other expense income to consolidated loss before income taxes as part of our calculation of adjusted ebitda to be
