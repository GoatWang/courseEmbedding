comparison of operating results for the three months ended march   and  general we recognized a net loss of  for the three months ended march   as compared to a net loss of  for the three months ended march   the decrease in net loss was primarily attributed to an increase in net interest income of  or  to  for the three months ended march   from  for the three months ended march   offset partially by an increase in noninterest expense of  or  to  for the three months ended march   compared to  for the three months ended march   interest income interest income increased  or  to  for the three months ended march   from  for the three months ended march   the increase in interest income reflects an increase in the average balances of interestearning assets which increased to  million for the three months ended march   from  million for the three months ended march   the increase in the average balances of interestearning assets reflects our emphasis on investing in interestearning assets the funds received from our conversion and public offering on june   and funds from increasing deposit levels since march   for the three months ended march   as compared to the three months ended march   the average balance of loans increased to  million from  million and the average balance of investments increased to  million from  million the average balance of interestbearing deposits decreased to  million for the three months ended march   as compared to  million for the three months ended march   as more of our excess funds were deployed into higheryielding loans and investment securities the increase in the average balance of our interestearning assets offset the decrease in the average yield on interestearning assets which decreased  basis points to  from  for the three months ended march   and  respectively the decrease in yield on loans reflects the sustained lower interest rate environment in our highly competitive market area particularly for commercial loans the decrease of  basis points in yield on our investment securities reflects the impact of higher prepayments on our mortgagebacked securities which had a negative impact on the investment portfolios overall yield interest expense interest expense decreased by  or  to  for the three months ended march   from  for the three months ended march   the decrease reflects a decrease in the average rate of our interestbearing liabilities of  basis points to  for the three months ended march   from  for the three months ended march   the decrease in our average cost of funds reflects the  basis point decrease in the cost of fhlb advances to  for the three months ended march   from  for the three months ended march   the decrease in the average rate on fhlb advances was related to the maturity of  million of our advances and refinancing these maturing advances with advances with lower rates during the first quarter of  interest expense on fhlb advances decreased  or  to  for the three months ended march   from  for the three months ended march   the decrease in the average cost of fhlb advances was offset partially by an increase in interest expense from our deposits which increased  or  to  for the three months ended march   from  for the three months ended march   the increase was primarily caused by an increase in the average balance of our deposits of  million or  to  million for the three months ended march   from  million for the three months ended march   due to the growth in our deposits money market accounts grew in average balance by  million or  to  million for the three months ended march   from  million for the three months ended march   certificates of deposit grew in average balance by  million or  to  million from  million for the same periods net interest income net interest income increased  or  to  for the three months ended march   from  for the three months ended march   which was largely a reflection of the increase in the ratio of average interestearning assets to average interestbearing liabilities to x for the three months ended march   from x for the three months ended march   provision for loan losses there was no provision for loan losses for the three months ended march   or  which is a reflection of our continued strong credit quality as evidenced by our continued low and decreasing levels of nonperforming loans our total allowance for loans losses was  of total gross loans at march   as compared to  at december   we do not have an allowance for specifically identified impaired loans as we generally charge off identified impairments on impaired loans to the allowance for loan losses to a net realizable value on those loans we do maintain an unallocated portion in our general allowance that we believe represents those probable incurred losses within our loan portfolio not specifically identified with any particular portfolio segment we believe that with our increased emphasis on commercial lending as opposed to mortgage lending there are inherent credit risks that we have not yet quantified through historical experience noninterest income noninterest income increased  or  to  for the three months ended march   from  for the three months ended march   the increase reflects both the recognition of  of income on bank owned life insurance related to the  million of bank owned life insurance purchased in march of  and the increase of  in other noninterest income which was due to higher loan related fees resulting from increased lending during the three months ended march   as compared to the three months ended march   table of contents noninterest expense noninterest expense increased  or  to  for the three months ended march   from  for the three months ended march   the increase largely attributed to increases in salaries and employee benefits occupancy and equipment expenses and professional and supervisory fees salary and employee benefits increased by  or  to  for the three months ended march   from  for the three months ended march   the increase reflects normal pay increases for employees additional expense associated with our esop and the addition of our new chief financial officer and compliance officer occupancy and equipment expenses increased by  or  to  for the three months ended march   from  for the three months ended march   the increase was primarily related to increased depreciation costs resulting from depreciation of renovation costs incurred for the renovation of our main office professional and supervisory fees increased by  or  to  for the three months ended march   from  for the three months ended march   the increase in professional and supervisory fees was related to the increased costs associated with our conversion to a public company subsequent to the period ended march   these increases were partially offset by decreases in fdic deposit insurance premiums and real estate owned expenses fdic deposit insurance premiums decreased by  or  to  for the three months ended march   from  for the three months ended march   and real estate owned expenses decreased by  or  to  for the three months ended march   from  for the three months ended march   fdic deposit insurance premiums decreased as a result of the reduction of insurance premiums by the fdic income tax expense there was no provision for income taxes for the three months ended march   or march   a valuation allowance has been recorded against all components of the net deferred tax asset except for the unrealized loss on available for sale securities based upon our cumulative operating losses in recent years the deferred tax asset will only be recognized in future periods upon the companys ability to realize and maintain profitable results of operations liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows loan repayments fhlb advances and repayments maturities and calls of investment securities while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates economic conditions and competition our assetliability committee is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies we believe that we have enough sources of liquidity to satisfy our short and longterm liquidity needs as of march   we regularly monitor and adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of i expected loan demand ii expected deposit flows iii yields available on interestearning deposits and securities and iv the objectives of our assetliability management program excess liquid assets are invested generally in interestearning and non interestearning deposits and short and mediumterm securities liquidity management is both a daily and longterm function of business management if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally we have borrowing agreements with the federal home loan bank of chicago fhlb that provide an additional source of funds our fhlb advances totaled  million at march   in addition the company has an irrevocable standby letter of credit with the fhlb of  million at march   to secure public deposits at march   we had the ability to borrow up to an additional  million from the fhlb subject to pledging additional collateral we also have an unused open line of credit at the independent bankersbank that would allow us to borrow up to  million at march   the company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements including a riskbased capital measure the riskbased capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating riskweighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and offbalance sheet items to broad risk categories at march   and december   the company exceeded all regulatory capital requirements the company is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines the net proceeds from the stock offering significantly increased our liquidity and capital resources over time the initial level of liquidity will be reduced as net proceeds from the stock offering are used for general corporate purposes including the funding of new loans our results of operations will be enhanced by the net proceeds from the stock offering resulting in increased net table of contents interest income however due to the increase in equity resulting from the net proceeds raised in the stock offering our return on equity will be adversely
