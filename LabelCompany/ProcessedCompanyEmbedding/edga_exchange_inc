electronic format start preamble august   pursuant to section b of the securities exchange act of  the “act” and rule b thereunder notice is hereby given that on august   edga exchange inc the “exchange” or “edga” filed with the securities and exchange commission “commission” the proposed rule change as described in items i and ii below which items have been prepared by the exchange the exchange has designated this proposal as a “noncontroversial” proposed rule change pursuant to section ba of the act  and rule bfiii start printed page thereunder which renders it effective upon filing with the commission the commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons i selfregulatory organizations statement of the terms of substance of the proposed rule change the exchange filed a proposal to amend rule  to describe a market data product known as edga book viewer the text of the proposed rule change is available at the exchanges web site at wwwbatstradingcom at the principal office of the exchange and at the commissions public reference room ii selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and statutory basis for the proposed rule change in its filing with the commission the exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change the text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in item iv below the exchange has prepared summaries set forth in sections a b and c below of the most significant parts of such statements a selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and statutory basis for the proposed rule change  purpose the exchange proposes to add language to rule  describing a market data product known as edga book viewer the proposal memorializes in the exchanges rules a data feed that is currently available through the exchanges public web site free of charge edga book viewer is a data feed that disseminates on a realtime basis the aggregated twoside quotations for up to five  price levels for all displayed orders for securities traded on the exchange and for which the exchanges reports quotes under the consolidated tape association “cta” plan or the nasdaqutp plan edga book viewer also contains the last ten  trades including time of trade price and share quantity edga book viewer is currently available via wwwbatstradingcom without charge the exchange will file a separate proposed rule change with the commission proposing fees to be charged for certain types of access to edga book viewer as of september    statutory basis the exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section b of the act in general and furthers the objectives of section b of the act in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices to promote just and equitable principles of trade to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and to protect investors and the public interest and that it is not designed to permit unfair discrimination among customers brokers or dealers this proposal is in keeping with those principles in that it promotes increased transparency through the dissemination of edga book viewer the exchange also believes this proposal is consistent with section b of the act because it protects investors and the public interest and promotes just and equitable principles of trade by providing investors with an alternative for receiving market data as requested by market data vendors and purchasers that expressed an interest in exchangeonly data for instances where consolidated data is no longer required to be purchased and displayed the proposed rule change would benefit investors by facilitating their prompt access to realtime depthofbook information contained in edga book viewer the proposed rule change also removes impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system by memorializing in the exchanges rules a data feed that is currently available through the exchanges public web site free of charge the exchange also believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section a of the act  in that it supports i fair competition among brokers and dealers among exchange markets and between exchange markets and markets other than exchange markets and ii the availability to brokers dealers and investors of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities furthermore the proposed rule change is consistent with rule  of regulation nms which provides that any national securities exchange that distributes information with respect to quotations for or transactions in an nms stock do so on terms that are not unreasonably discriminatory edga book viewer is accessed and subscribed to on a voluntary basis in that neither the exchange nor market data distributors are required by any rule or regulation to make this data available accordingly distributors and subscribers can discontinue use at any time and for any reason in adopting regulation nms the commission granted selfregulatory organizations and brokerdealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data to consumers of such data it was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to users and consumers of such data and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data the exchange believes that the data products proposed herein are precisely the sort of market data products that the commission envisioned when it adopted regulation nms the commission concluded that regulation nms—by lessening regulation of the market in proprietary data—would itself further the acts goals of facilitating efficiency and competition efficiency is promoted when brokerdealers who do not need the data beyond the prices sizes market center identifications of the nbbo and consolidated last sale information are not required to receive and pay for such data the commission also believes that efficiency is promoted when brokerdealers may choose to receive and pay for additional market data based on their own internal analysis of the need for such data by removing “unnecessary regulatory restrictions” on the ability of exchanges to sell their own data regulation nms advanced the goals of the act and the principles reflected in its legislative history in addition edga book viewer removes impediments to and perfects the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system because edga book viewer provides investors with alternative market data and competes with similar market data product currently offered by the new york stock exchange inc “nyse” and the nasdaq stock market llc start printed page “nasdaq” the provision of new options for investors to receive market data was a primary goal of the market data amendments adopted by regulation nms edga book viewer is precisely the sort of market data product that the commission envisioned when it adopted regulation nms b selfregulatory organizations statement on burden on competition the exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act the proposal is not intended to address any competitive issues but rather to memorialize in the exchanges rules a data feed that is currently available through the exchanges public web site free of charge nonetheless the exchange believes that the proposal will promote competition by the exchange offering a service similar to that offered by the nyse and nasdaq thus the exchange believes this proposed rule change is necessary to permit fair competition among national securities exchanges therefore the exchange does not believe the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act c selfregulatory organizations statement on comments on the proposed rule change received from members participants or others the exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change iii date of effectiveness of the proposed rule change and timing for commission action the exchange has designated this rule filing as noncontroversial under section ba of the act  and paragraph f of rule b thereunder the proposed rule change effects a change that a does not significantly affect the protection of investors or the public interest b does not impose any significant burden on competition and c by its terms does not become operative for  days after the date of the filing or such shorter time as the commission may designate if consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest provided that the selfregulatory organization has given the commission written notice of its intent to file the proposed rule change along with a brief description and text of the proposed rule change at least five business days prior to the date of filing of the proposed rule change or such shorter time as designated by the commission at any time

section b of the securities exchange act of  the “act” and rule b thereunder notice is hereby given that on august   edga exchange inc the “exchange” or “edga” filed with the securities and exchange commission “commission” the proposed rule change as described in items i ii and iii below which items have been prepared by the exchange the exchange has start printed page designated the proposed rule change as one establishing or changing a member due fee or other charge imposed by the exchange under section baii of the act  and rule bf thereunder which renders the proposed rule change effective upon filing with the commission the commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons i selfregulatory organizations statement of the terms of substance of the proposed rule change the exchange filed a proposal to amend the market data section of its fee schedule to adopt fees for a market data product called edga book viewer the text of the proposed rule change is available at the exchanges web site at wwwbatstradingcom at the principal office of the exchange and at the commissions public reference room ii selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and statutory basis for the proposed rule change in its filing with the commission the exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change the text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in item iv below the exchange has prepared summaries set forth in sections a b and c below of the most significant parts of such statements a selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and statutory basis for the proposed rule change  purpose the exchange proposes to amend the market data section of its fee schedule to adopt fees for market data product called edga book viewer edga book viewer is a data feed that disseminates on a realtime basis the aggregated twoside quotations for up to five  price levels for all displayed orders for securities traded on the exchange and for which the exchanges reports quotes under the consolidated tape association “cta” plan or the nasdaqutp plan edga book viewer also contains the last ten  trades including time of trade price and share quantity edga book viewer is currently available via wwwbatstradingcom without charge the exchange now proposes to amend its fee schedule to incorporate fees for distribution of edga book viewer to subscribers edga book viewer will remain available via wwwbatstradingcom for viewing without charge the proposed fees include the following each of which are described in detail below i distribution fees for both internal and external distributors  ii usage fees for both professional  and nonprofessional  users  iii an enterprise fee  and iv a digital media enterprise fee distribution fees as proposed each internal distributor that receives edga book viewer shall pay a fee of  per month the exchange does not propose to charge any user fees for edga book viewer where the data is received and subsequently internally distributed to professional or nonprofessional users in addition the exchange proposes to charge external distributors that receives edga book viewer a fee of  per month user fees the exchange proposes to charge those who receive edga book viewer from external distributors different fees for both their professional users and nonprofessional users the exchange will assess a monthly fee for professional users of  per user nonprofessional users will be assessed a monthly fee of  per user the exchange does not propose to charge per user fees to internal distributors external distributors that receives edga book viewer would be required to count every professional user and nonprofessional user to which they provide edga book viewer the requirements for which are identical to that currently in place for the bats one feed thus the external distributors count will include every person and device that accesses the data regardless of the purpose for which the individual or device uses the data external distributors must report all professional and nonprofessional users in accordance with the following in connection with an external distributors distribution of edga book viewer the distributor should count as one user each unique user that the distributor has entitled to have access to edga book viewer however where a device is dedicated specifically to a single individual the distributor should count only the individual and need not count the device the external distributor should identify and report each unique user if a user uses the same unique method to gain access to edga book viewer the distributor should count that as one user however if a unique user uses multiple methods to gain access to start printed page edga book viewer eg a single user has multiple passwords and user identifications the external distributor should report all of those methods as an individual user external distributors should report each unique individual person who receives access through multiple devices as one user so long as each device is dedicated specifically to that individual if an external distributor entitles one or more individuals to use the same device the external distributor should include only the individuals and not the device in the count each external distributor will receive a credit against its monthly distributor fee for edga book viewer equal to the amount of its monthly usage fees up to a maximum of the distributor fee for edga book viewer for example an external distributor will be subject to a  monthly distributor fee where they receive edga book viewer if that external distributor reports user quantities totaling  or more of monthly usage of edga book viewer it will pay no net distributor fee whereas if that same external distributor were to report user quantities totaling  of monthly usage it will pay a net of  for the distributor fee external distributors will remain subject to the per user fees discussed above enterprise fee the exchange also proposes to establish a  per month enterprise fee that will permit a recipient firm who receives edga book viewer from an external distributor to receive the data for an unlimited number of professional and nonprofessional users for example if a recipient firm had  professional users who each receive edga book viewer at  per month then that recipient firm will pay  per month in professional users fees under the proposed enterprise fee the recipient firm will pay a flat fee of  for an unlimited number of professional and nonprofessional users for edga book viewer a recipient firm must pay a separate enterprise fee for each external distributor that controls the display of edga book viewer if it wishes such user to be covered by an enterprise fee rather than by per user fees a recipient firm that pays the enterprise fee will not have to report its number of such users on a monthly basis however every six months a recipient firm must provide the exchange with a count of the total number of natural person users of each product including both professional and nonprofessional users lastly the proposed enterprise fee would be counted towards the distributor fee credit described above under which an external distributor receives a credit towards its distributor fee equal to the amount of its monthly edga book viewer user fees digital media enterprise fee the exchange proposes to adopt a digital media enterprise fee of  per month for edga book viewer as an alternative to proposed user fees discussed above a recipient firm may purchase a monthly digital media enterprise license to receive edga book viewer from an external distributor to distribute to an unlimited number of professional and nonprofessional users for viewing via television web sites and mobile devices for informational and nontrading purposes only without having to account for the extent of access to the data or the report the number of users to the exchange lastly the proposed digital media enterprise fee would be counted towards the distributor fee credit described above under which an external distributor receives a credit towards its distributor fee equal to the amount of its monthly edga book viewer user fees implementation date the exchange proposes to implement the proposed changes to its fee schedule on september    statutory basis the exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the objectives of section  of the act in general and furthers the objectives of section b in particular as it is designed to provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues fees and other charges among its members and other recipients of exchange data the exchange believes that the proposed rates are equitable and nondiscriminatory in that they apply uniformly to all recipients of exchange data the exchange believes the proposed fees are competitive with those charged by other venues and therefore reasonable and equitably allocated to recipients lastly the exchange also believes that the proposed fees are reasonable and nondiscriminatory because they will apply uniformly to all recipients of exchange data the exchange also believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section a of the act  in that it supports i fair competition among brokers and dealers among exchange markets and between exchange markets and markets other than exchange markets and ii the availability to brokers dealers and investors of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities furthermore the proposed rule change is consistent with rule  of regulation nms which provides that any national securities exchange that distributes information with respect to quotations for or transactions in an nms stock do so on terms that are not unreasonably discriminatory in adopting regulation nms the commission granted selfregulatory organizations and brokerdealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data to the public it was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to consumers and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data in addition the proposed fees would not permit unfair discrimination because all of the exchanges customers and market data vendors will be subject to the proposed fees on an equivalent basis edga book viewer is distributed and purchased on a voluntary basis in that neither the exchange nor market data distributors are required by any rule or regulation to make this data available accordingly distributors and users can discontinue use at any time and for any reason including due to an assessment of the reasonableness of fees charged firms have a wide variety of alternative market data products from which to choose such as similar proprietary data products offered by other exchanges and consolidated data moreover the exchange is not required to make any proprietary data products available or to offer any specific pricing alternatives to any customers in addition the fees that are the subject of this rule filing are constrained by competition as explained below in the exchanges statement on burden on competition the existence of alternatives to edga book viewer further ensures that the exchange cannot set unreasonable fees or fees that are unreasonably discriminatory when vendors and subscribers can elect such alternatives that is the exchange competes with other exchanges and their affiliates that provide similar market data products if another exchange or its affiliate were to charge less to distribute its similar product than the exchange charges to consolidate and distribute edga book viewer prospective users likely would start printed page not subscribe to or would cease subscribing to edga book viewer the exchange notes that the commission is not required to undertake a costofservice or ratemaking approach the exchange believes that even if it were possible as a matter of economic theory costbased pricing for noncore market data would be so complicated that it could not be done practically distributor fee the exchange believes that the proposed distributor fees are also reasonable equitably allocated and not unreasonably discriminatory the fees for members and nonmembers are uniform except with respect to reasonable distinctions with respect to internal and external distribution the exchange believes that the distributor fees for edga book viewer are reasonable and fair in light of alternatives offered by other market centers for example edga book viewer provides investors with alternative market data and competes with similar market data product currently offered by the new york stock exchange inc “nyse” and the nasdaq stock market llc “nasdaq” specifically the nyse charges an access fee of  per month for nyse openbook which is higher than the external distributor fee proposed herein for edga book viewer user fees the exchange believes that implementing the professional and nonprofessional user fees for edga book viewer are equitable and reasonable because they will result in greater availability to professional and nonprofessional users moreover introducing a modest nonprofessional user fee for edga book viewer is reasonable because it provides an additional method for retail investors to access edga book viewer data by providing the same data that is available to professional users the exchange believes that the proposed fees are equitable and not unfairly discriminatory because they will be charged uniformly to recipient firms and users the fee structure of differentiated professional and nonprofessional fees is utilized by the exchange for the bats one feed and has long been used by other exchanges for their proprietary data products and by the nasdaq utp and the cta and cq plans in order to reduce the price of data to retail investors and make it more broadly available offering edga book viewer to nonprofessional users with the same data available to professional users results in greater equity among data recipients in addition the proposed fees are reasonable when compared to similar fees for comparable products offered by the nyse and nasdaq specifically nyse offers nyse openbook for a monthly fee of  per professional subscriber and  per nonprofessional subscriber nasdaq offers nasdaq bookviewer for the same fees as nasdaq totalview which is a monthly fee of  per professional subscriber and  per nonprofessional subscriber the exchanges proposed per user fees for edga book viewer are less than the nyse and nasdaq fees enterprise fee the proposed enterprise fee for edga book viewer is equitable and reasonable as the fees proposed are less than the enterprise fees currently charged for nasdaq book viewer which is subject to the exact same fees as nasdaq totalview nasdaq charges an enterprise fee of  per month for nasdaq totalview which is far greater than the proposed enterprise fee of  per month for edga book viewer in addition the enterprise fee proposed by the exchange could result in a fee reduction for recipient firms with a large number of professional and nonprofessional users if a recipient firm has a smaller number of professional users of edga book viewer then it may continue using the per user structure and benefit from the per user fee reductions by reducing prices for recipient firms with a large number of professional and nonprofessional users the exchange believes that more firms may choose to receive and to distribute edga book viewer thereby expanding the distribution of this market data for the benefit of investors the exchange further believes that the proposed enterprise fee is reasonable because it will simplify reporting for certain recipients that have large numbers of professional and nonprofessional users firms that pay the proposed enterprise fee will not have to report the number of users on a monthly basis as they currently do but rather will only have to count natural person users every six months which is a significant reduction in administrative burden finally the exchange believes that it is equitable and not unfairly discriminatory to establish an enterprise fee because it reduces the exchanges costs and the distributors administrative burdens in tracking and auditing large numbers of usersstart printed page  digital media enterprise fee the exchange believes that the proposed digital media enterprise fee for edga book viewer provides for an equitable allocation of reasonable fees among recipients of the data and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination among customers brokers or dealers in establishing the digital media enterprise fee the exchange recognizes that there is demand for a more seamless and easiertoadminister data distribution model that takes into account the expanded variety of media and communication devices that investors utilize today the exchange believes the digital media enterprise fee will be easy to administer because data recipients that purchase it would not be required to differentiate between professional and nonprofessional users account for the extent of access to the data or report the number of users this is a significant reduction on a recipient firms administrative burdens and is a significant value to investors for example a television broadcaster could display edga book viewer data during marketrelated programming and on its web site or allow viewers to view the data via their mobile devices creating a more seamless distribution model that will allow investors more choice in how they receive and view market data all without having to account for andor measure who accesses the data and how often they do so the proposed digital media enterprise fee is equitable and reasonable because it will also enable recipient firms to more widely distribute data from edga book viewer to investors for informational purposes at a lower cost than is available today for example a recipient firm may purchase an enterprise license in the amount of  per month for to receive edga book viewer from an external distributor that receives the product for an unlimited number of professional and nonprofessional users which is greater than the proposed digital media enterprise fee the exchange also believes the amount of the digital media enterprise fee is reasonable as compared to the existing enterprise fees discussed above because the distribution of edga book viewer data is limited to television web sites and mobile devices for informational purposes only while distribution of edga book viewer data pursuant to an enterprise license contains no such limitation the exchange also believes that the proposed digital media enterprise fee is equitable and reasonable because it is less than similar fees charged by other exchanges b selfregulatory organizations statement on burden on competition the exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act as amended the exchanges ability to price edga book viewer is constrained by i competition among exchanges other trading platforms and trade reporting facilities “trf” that compete with each other in a variety of dimensions ii the existence of inexpensive realtime consolidated data and marketspecific data and free delayed data and iii the inherent contestability of the market for proprietary data the exchange and its market data products are subject to significant competitive forces and the proposed fees represent responses to that competition to start the exchange competes intensely for order flow it competes with the other national securities exchanges that currently trade equities with electronic communication networks with quotes posted in finras alternative display facility with alternative trading systems and with securities firms that primarily trade as principal with their customer order flow in addition edga book viewer competes with a number of alternative products for instance edga book viewer does provide a complete picture of all trading activity in a security rather the other national securities exchanges the several trfs of finra and electronic communication networks “ecn” that produce proprietary data all produce trades and trade reports each is currently permitted to produce last sale information products and many currently do including nasdaq and nyse in addition market participants can gain access to edga last sale and depthofbook quotations though integrated with the prices of other markets on feeds made available through the sips in sum the availability of a variety of alternative sources of information imposes significant competitive pressures on exchange data products and the exchanges compelling need to attract order flow imposes significant competitive pressure on the exchange to act equitably fairly and reasonably in setting the proposed data product fees the proposed data product fees are in part responses to that pressure the exchange believes that the proposed fees would reflect an equitable allocation of its overall costs to users of its facilities in addition when establishing the proposed fees the exchange considered the competitiveness of the market for proprietary data and all of the implications of that competition the exchange believes that it has considered all relevant factors and has not considered irrelevant factors in order to establish fair reasonable and not unreasonably discriminatory fees and an equitable allocation of fees among all users the existence of alternatives to edga book viewer including existing similar feeds by other exchanges consolidated data and proprietary data from other sources ensures that the exchange cannot set unreasonable fees or fees that are unreasonably discriminatory when vendors and subscribers can elect these alternatives or choose not to purchase a specific proprietary data product if its cost to purchase is not justified by the returns any particular vendor or subscriber would achieve through the purchase c selfregulatory organizations statement on comments on the proposed rule change received from members participants or others the exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change iii date of effectiveness of the proposed rule change and timing for commission action the foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to section ba of the act  and paragraph f of rule b thereunder at any time within  days of the filing of the proposed rule change the commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule change if it appears to the commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest for the protection of investors or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the act iv solicitation of comments interested persons are invited to submit written data views and arguments concerning the foregoing including whether the
