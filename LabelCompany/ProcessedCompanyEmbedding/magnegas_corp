corporation nasdaq mnga is a technology company that counts among its inventions a patented process that converts liquid waste into hydrogen based fuels the company currently sells magnegas® into the metal working market as a faster safer and hotter replacement to acetylene in addition the company is developing a variety of ancillary uses for magnegas® fuels by utilizing its high flame temperature for cocombustion of hydrocarbon fuels and other advanced applications it is also selling equipment for the sterilization of biocontaminated liquid waste such as pig manure or leachates for various industrial and agricultural markets we have been using magnegas ® at our offsite maintenance facility for  months i feel that it is a superior product to any other oxyfuel combination on the market it cuts even the thickest metals faster and cleaner than anything i have seen douglas foster maintenance supervisor of major utility in florida it’s rare to see a clean burning technology that is actually faster magnegas has accomplished this with magnegas ® brian linton ceo of the recycling center of florida we tried the new version of magnegas in may i noticed a much faster preheat and cutting speed i am looking forward to using this cutting fuel when it is released dick clark hoekstra truck equipment the new magnegas has increased our cutting speed by  provides a much cleaner cut far less smoke than propylene also it has reduced our oxygen by  kurt peterseon elenbaas steel supply worldwidedistributorsview locations  map tweets by magnegas technology  magnegas loading stock data  technology summary of the magnegas® plasma arc flow technology magnegas corporation® is a waste to energy company that converts liquid waste into a hydrogen based fuel the company owns the patents to this revolutionary technology which gasifies or sterilizes a number of liquid wastes and produces a gaseous fuel known as magnegas®  magnegas® is a cost competitive and clean burning fuel that is essentially interchangeable with natural gas propane and acetylene and it can be cocombusted with existing hydrocarbon fuels magnegas also has significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions when compared to fossil fuel the magnegas® system occupies a small footprint and runs in a sealed quiet and smoke free system   magnegas® fuel can be used for metal cutting transportation fuel cocombustion with fossil fuels heating    magnegas® recyclers can process sewage  sludge agricultural waste leachates oil based liquids industrial waste liquids certain oil and industrial waste liquids require further testing or mixing with water or other liquids to process   the patented technology is based on flowing the target liquid waste through our patented submerged electric arc system between two electrodes the arc decomposes the liquid molecules into atoms as it forms a plasma around the tips of the electrodes at about °f   c magnegas® is created as the decomposed atoms rise to the surface and naturally forms into a gas magnegas® is a cost competitive synthetic gas made from many liquid wastes such as sewage sludge animal manure glycerin used antifreeze some oil based liquids and waste water   sterilization recycler the post combustion exhaust from magnegas® has been certified by an automotive laboratory accredited with the epa to surpass all epa requirements without a catalytic converter and releases more oxygen when it burns than other fuels making it dramatically cleaner than gasoline diesel and natural gas the magnegas recyclers have two operating modes gasification mode is suitable to gasify target liquids for the maximum conversion of liquid to fuel and is most suitable for oily or hazardous wastes that require elimination the waste is converted into magnegas and carbon precipitates in this mode the liquid is gasified sterilization mode is intended to sterilize target liquid wastes such as sewage agricultural wastes leachates or any effluent where eliminating bacteriological activity is beneficial to convert the waste liquid into a fertilizer or class a waste this results in the production of magnegas and the same quantity of sterilized liquid in this mode the liquid is retained but completely sterilized certification of magnegas exhaust magnegas® fuel was shown by epa accredited laboratory analysis results to be suitable for use as automotive fuel without catalytic converters while surpassing all current epa requirements for combustion exhaust emissions as shown below the data was obtained using a honda civic adapted to run on natural gas and used with magnegas without any change in timing and stochiometric ratio the data on gasoline were obtained via the use of an identical honda civic running on gasoline all data were obtained using the complex epa routine simulating various city and mountain driving conditions the quality of magnegas® exhaust is dramatically better than that of natural gas and gasoline magnegas® exhaust is much lower than epa requirements has about  less green gases co than gasoline exhaust and contains  to  oxygen based on these measurements it is postulated that magnegas fuel can be used as an additive to fossil fuels to improve their exhaust characteristics download patents  kb  downloads  our productsmagnegas magnetote cocombustion sustainable solutions about the team

our newly acquired customer relationships to springboard organically into new markets across the southeast and sun belt states we are hopeful this will translate into accelerated revenue growth in the remainder of  and beyond magnegas is increasingly focused on driving immediate revenue growth by adding experienced sales executives with deep client relationships we executed this same model in
