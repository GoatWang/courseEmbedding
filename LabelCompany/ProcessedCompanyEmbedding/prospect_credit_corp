bonds longterm horizon growth valueprospect capital corporation nasdaqpsec has just issued new senior notes the new bonds are callable and are currently priced at  with a  coupon the notes are not listed as being convertible the prospectus for prospect capital corp  senior notes states we expect to use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes initially to maintain balance sheet liquidity involving repayment of debt under our credit facility investments in high quality shortterm debt instruments or a combination thereof and thereafter to make longterm investments in accordance with our investment objective unfortunately the new prospect capital bonds are not rated by moodys and they are callable moodys does rate prospect funding llc which is a senior secured revolving credit facility for prospect capital corporation the credit facility is rated far better than prospect capital corps own credit rating here is a comparison between prospect capitals new issue and berkshire

hype zero does not mince words  an investors  initial investment is worth   in dividend   in nav that is an anemic return of almost  over  years that return is definitely not worth the risk in  yielding prospect capital offers growth sa author todd johnson points out the company pays monthly dividends of prospect capitals peer group he writes i prefer to buy additional shares in american capital nasdaqacas american capital receives quarterly fees upon shareholder equity in american capital agency corp nasdaqagnc and american capital mortgage nasdaqmtge debt to equity psec debt to equity ratio data by ycharts though the new prospect capital corp bonds are callable some investors could consider the  yield to be a good deal even though the bonds could be called it is of the utmost importance that investors refer to the companys prospectus for details redemption information callable at  on  and every coupon date thereafterthe date from which interest shall accrue on the notes is thursday september   the interest payment dates for the notes shall be march  and september  of each year commencing march   the prospectus states that the redemption price is  the price of the bonds could go down if the companys credit is downgraded if interest rates go up or if the company defaults another recent prospectus for prospect capital  senior notes pry states convertible bonds buyback between january   and february   we repurchased  million of our august  convertible bonds at a price of  of par including commissions the transactions will result in our recognizing  of loss in the quarter ended march   layered strategy for the purposes of an example an investor could consider mixing the lower credit quality prospect capital corp bonds with call protected higher credit quality corp bonds or another favored call protected bond the reasoning is simple diversification the fact is i tend to avoid general electric corp bonds even though they are rated well and yield more than several contemporaries this is because general electric has a ton of debt when prospect capitals debt to equity ratio chart is juxtaposed with general electric the jagged graph appears to be small and smooth psec debt to equity ratio data by ycharts lets compare them to berkshire hathaway and walmart debt to equity ratio however this time lets look at the maximum available history psec debt to equity ratio data by ycharts a diversified approach the prospect capital senior notes should be considered with caution due to the credit quality and call feature larger market cap does not mean a companys bonds are safer however there is a huge difference between these companies notice prospect capital is a flat line at the bottom of the chart psec market cap data by ycharts market cap prospect capital b berkshire hathaway b general electric b walmart b individual and institutional investors should be mindful of appropriate allocations based on size and strength an allocation into prospect capital corp bonds would probably be smaller than an allocation into larger higher rated companies here is a diversified example for an individual and institutional portfolio bonds individual k portfolio institution m portfolio prospect capital     berkshire     ge     walmart     subtotal   stocks prospect capital price    berkshire nysebrkb price    general electric price    walmart price    subtotal   income fund american income fund mrf price    grand total     this is a bondheavy example keep in mind that when interest rates go up the prices of the bonds will fall investors might consider using the income from the bonds to go into more income funds over time overall prospect capitals yield is attractive and the companys stock currently has a  dividend however dividends can be cut credit ratings can be downgraded so it is important to consider the balance between quality and yield this is an example and is not a recommendation to buy or sell it is important
