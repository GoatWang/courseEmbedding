research process has remained constant since the inception of the fund the fund looks for opportunities in companies that have temporarily disappointed investors industries in turmoil or out of favor and countries in economic downturns or overlooked by the market the investment process involves the following steps  analyze understand business models thoroughly understand a company and the market in which it operates among other critical factors the teams documentdriven analysis examines a companys market share the nature of its products and its business contingencies  recast financial statements financial statements are recast because conservative accounting practices can mask the true earnings power of a company in our view accounting practices are sometimes too liberal our goal is to uncover a companys true economic earnings using only demonstrated results  calculate intrinsic value the team places great emphasis on balance sheet valuation such as enterprise value to asset replacement value cash flow valuation such as evebit investments are made based on significant discounts to what is believed to be a companys intrinsic value  typically invest for the long term the team typically seeks a discount to what they believe is a companys intrinsic value they seek further protection by determining a margin of safety in each holding this margin of safety is viewed as a form of protection against uncertainty in a fundamentally unknowable future the global fund may also invest in nonequity securities in an attempt to help preserve purchasing power these include gold

most first eagle managers have held gold and big stakes in cash that has hurt returns for the past year first eagle overseas sgovx and first eagle us value fevax have lagged more than  of their peers according to morningstar but longtime shareholders should not be surprised by the weak results for decades the funds have followed a conservative approach although it has often lagged in rallies first eagles cautious strategy has produced sterling results in downturns by limiting losses in hard times the company has generated winning longterm records during the past  years first eagle overseas returned  annually outdoing  of foreign large blend funds first eagle us value returned  annually topping  of large blend funds first eagle fund of america fefax and first eagle global sgenx both topped more than  of their peers over the past decade  to protect shareholders the funds focus on solid companies that sell at discounted prices when the managers cant find bargains they hold cash in recent years the funds have often owned a bit of gold as an insurance policy against unexpected shocks the most important goal is to avoid a permanent impairment of capital said robert hordon a portfolio manager of first eagle global income builder febax the first eagle managers are patient they often buy unloved stocks and wait years for rebounds because they take contrarian positions the funds are only suitable for shareholders who understand the strategy and can stomach waiting through periods of subpar performance since many of the first eagle funds have now trailed for awhile this could be an ideal time to invest the cautious approach should have special appeal to wary investors who worry that the current bull market is beginning to reach its peak over the years the first eagle managers have made a series of prescient calls in the late s the funds stayed away from japanese stocks as they were peaking and about to crash first eagle avoided highflying technology stocks in the late s and shaky banks before the financial crisis this year first eagle lowered its weighting in emerging markets a move that paid off when stocks in latin america and asia sank in each case the managers avoided hot stocks because they seemed expensive but many of the moves were early and took months or years to produce dividends in june  the company launched its newest fund first eagle global income builder a balanced portfolio that holds a mix of stocks and bonds while typical balanced funds focus on bluechip stocks and investmentgrade bonds first eagle takes a wideranging approach the portfolio managers are free to buy most kinds of stocks and bonds from around the world the fund currently has almost no investmentgrade bonds the portfolio managers worry that highquality bonds would sink sharply if interest rates rose instead the fund focuses on highyield bonds which are rated below investment grade going forward highyield bonds can act as a cushion against rising rates

used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high above average this fund scores above average because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high average this funds expenses are rated as average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other characteristics before making your investment
