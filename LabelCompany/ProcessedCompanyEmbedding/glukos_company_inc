the market whey protein isolate bars and powders utilize glucose for rapid delivery and quick recovery feb   am est phoenix feb   prnewswire  the glukos company inc an allnatural sports nutrition brand today announced the launch of its groundbreaking protein bars and powders which deliver protein into the bloodstream faster and more effectively than any product in the crowded protein market constructed with highquality whey protein isolate glukos protein bars and powders utilize glucose  the good sugar  and contain no sucrose high fructose corn syrup artificial sweetener color or flavoring glucose is known as the good sugar because it fuels all human plant and animal life on earth with instant natural energy this characteristic makes it the most efficient catalyst to drive glukos protein into the muscles for a quicker more effective recovery  knowing the protein market is saturated with ambiguous claims and unrecognizable ingredients we had to provide consumers with a clear differentiator and believe glucose provides us with the edge said mick mccormick president and ceo glukos company inc similar to our energy product the utilization of glucose in our new protein is an absolute game changer but just as important our bars and powders taste better than any protein on the market following any physical activity the body provides an optimal minute anabolic window where the muscles become spongelike and need nutrients specifically protein for recovery and growth knowing the body requires a protein to be combined with a carbohydrate for absorption founder mark jensen paired glucose the fastest carbohydrate with whey protein isolate to speed up the delivery process which in turn allows the muscles to recover quicker glukos protein is unlike plantbased proteins because it uses the whey protein isolate that incorporates more of the essential amino acids for optimal muscle recovery and growth unlike maltodextrin and sucralosebased products that create byproducts such as lactic acid and triglycerides glukos avoids those harmful side effects through its use of glucose in addition to the sciencebased efficacy of glukos new line of protein bars and powders taste plays a critical role in providing a point of differentiation for consumers with only a few ingredients in the bars and powders glukos tastes great yet still outperforms its leading competitors available in three flavors – chocolate peanut butter cookies n crème and rocky road – glukos protein bars are under  calories with  grams of protein per bar the protein powder is available in two flavors – chocolate and vanilla – providing  grams of protein and  calories in a serving in addition to glukos protein powders and bars glukos energy is available in six different delivery mechanisms including readyto drinks gels powders tablets gummies and bars for more information on glukos protein including where to purchase product please visit glukosenergycom or check out facebook and twitter glukos company incglukos is a natural energy foods brand that provides the ultimate source of natural energy and protein for athletes to perform at their optimal levels whether an athlete is training or participating in sport glukos is the ultimate pre during and postworkout energy source that absorbs into the bloodstream instantaneously providing twice the energy twice as fast as any other energy product on the market and protein source that drives protein into the muscles for the fastest recovery formula available developed by triathlete and former collegiate runner mark jensen

the measurement definition is milligrams per deciliter mgdl the american diabetes association recommends a fasting plasma glucose level of  mgdl and after meals less than  mgdl unlike other sports products glukos provides almost instant energy it passes through the cell wall of your mouth where it enters directly into the bloodstream nothing movesyou faster other sport fuels use inferior sugars like fructose and sucrose that have to be digested before they can provide any benefit this process wastes valuable time and even robs your body of energy glucose absorbed immediately starts in mouth results in instant energy sucrose  fructose digested in the intestines results in delayed absorption and byproducts triglycerides fat and lactic acid glukos gives your body a pure sustained source of
