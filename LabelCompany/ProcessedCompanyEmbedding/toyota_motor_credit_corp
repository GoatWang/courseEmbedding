with the primary objective being to obtain one’s personal information this information can then be utilized to steal a person’s identity for example a toyota lottery phishing scam is often sent from chinese cn german de or british couk addresses but can originate from anywhere and look very official even to the most savvy of internet users toyota will never ask you to send passwords login names

update your credit card information do not respond this is a phishing scam recipients of suspicious email like this should delete the message from their inbox and if possible update their email filter
