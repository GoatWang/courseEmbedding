and how do you measure it jan   leadershipcompanies  executives iw  the art of making the da vinci intuitive surgical approaches manufacturing with an innovationfirst mindset josh cable   nov   its fitting that intuitive surgical inc is headquartered in sunnyvale calif in the heart of silicon valley the maker of the da vinci robotassisted surgical system is approaching  billion in annual revenue with a total workforce of fewer than  people approximately  of them are involved in the companys manufacturing operations according to augusto gus castello intuitives senior vice president for product operations thats a remarkably low headcount for a product manufacturer asserts castello  especially one whose flagship product requires  discrete components and more than  million lines of software code most manufacturing companies that are considered to be very profitable or at least using their resources in an effective way probably generate about  to  of revenue per employee castello says and here were at almost  million of revenue per head its the sort of ratio that software companies have its the sort of ratio achieved by a company with a high level of selfawareness intuitive surgical knows what its core competence is  developing robotic technologies for minimally invasive surgical procedures  which is why on the manufacturing side of the business we are very focused on innovation and supporting innovation castello explains our goal in manufacturing is to enable the company to introduce very innovative products for minimally invasive robotic procedures in record time castello says thats the only way that we believe that were going to stay ahead of the competition intuitive surgicals da vinci robotassisted surgical system replicates the movements of the surgeons hands making it easier for surgeons to perform complex procedures to castellos point intuitive launched the secondgeneration da vinci system  the da vinci s  in about three years it took the company about the same amount of time to launch the thirdgeneration da vinci si in april  even though the feature content was much much richer castello says we dont want to be leapfrogged castello says we want it to always be ahead of what the competition might throw at us from both a productfeature standpoint as well from a costbenefit standpoint to the hospital with time to market so critical to the companys business model castello explains that manufacturing will bend over backwards to introduce a product on schedule even if the price or the cost contentthe materialcontent cost and laborcontent costand perhaps even some of the service aspects of it might not be ideal whats important is to introduce it and to get feedback from the doctor he says so first and foremost the product has to be efficacious it has to be reliable and then well work through the bugs in manufacturing castello makes no bones about the fact that intuitive is a productdriven engineeringdriven company and the company farms out a good portion of its production to several contract manufacturers in the bay area however intuitive performs certain key operations  such as manufacturing of the robotic arms for the da vinci system and final product integration and testing  at its plant in sunnyvale and makes its endowrist surgical instruments at its highvolume lowmix plant in mexicali mexico gus castello our goal in manufacturing is to enable the company to introduce very innovative products for minimally invasive robotic procedures in record time during the development of the da vinci si intuitive conducted more than  simulated surgical procedures at its sunnyvale facility although castello emphasizes that the procedures involved props  not animals or humans the simulations helped the company assess whether the new system met its quality standards we had a lot of folks working seven days a week and weekends and evenings here just to be able to compress that timeline and to make sure that we have the right information available to us so we can make the decision as to whether or not this new system was ready for primetime castello explains since hitting primetime adoption of the da vinci si has been brisk in fourthquarter  da vinci si sales represented  of intuitives system revenues sales of the da vinci si helped push the companys fullyear revenue to  billion in  up from  million in  in thirdquarter  intuitives overall revenue increased  yearoveryear to  million while net income increased  to  million through the first three quarters of  intuitive already had reached  billion in
