necessary in todays world where trade cheating has become the norm nowhere is it more rampant and destructive than in the case of china it is the  pound gorilla when it comes to cheating they have done this through their massive state owned enterprises and state owned economy they have done it by stealing ip and cheating in trade      the types of trade cheating to manipulate trade and make free trade an irrelevant concept include currencymanipulation massive subsidies to export related industries the use of atax system that works both as a tariff barrier for inbound goods and asubsidy mechanism for targeted export products the vat tax as it is known or value added tax is both predatory and protectionist to an extreme added together all these have resulted in the end of global free trade  hillary clinton has claimed trumps trade policies will start a trade war but what she fails to recognize is we are already in one trump clearly sees it and he will work to put an end to chinas mercantilist trade war a war it has been waging against us for nearly  decades a war in which we have yet to show up to fight trump gets it he knows that it is past time to put an end to this attack on our economy good paying job creation our manufacturing sector our national security and the future of our middle class he will do this by negotiating from a position of strength not condescending weakness china respects strength but takes full advantage of weakness in the end it will be in chinas best interest to stop cheating on trade     its not just the usa that has had it with chinas mercantilism predatory export pricing and massive protectionism at home in todays wsj article by andrew byrne chinas oneway deals grate on germany in which germanys chancellor merkel  loses patience with chinas shopping spree in europe as it closes its own markets   trump also knows that it is this very mercantilism that has not only undermined the concept of free trade but killed it clyde prestowitz in his excellent article in the washington monthly titled free trade is dead drives home this point and how the countless ftas the us has put in place have failed america its economy and its workers   during era of free trade since  our accumulated trade deficit in goods is approaching  trillion most every fta from nafta to the korean fta has not just failed to live up to it promises but failed miserably netnet trade and good paying job creation have been seriously negative the two worst agreements were giving china favored nations trading status and allowing them entry into the wto the latter before they became a market driven economy which they still are not today trump knows this but hillary clinton has first been against and then voted for most ftas that have been approved by congress trump gets what hillary doesnt you dont win a trade war with appeasement or more free trade agreements in particular you cant win one if you refuse to acknowledge it even

excellent articledanhttpwashingtonmonthlycommagazinejunejulyaugfreetradeisdeadthe next president needs to recognize that globalization is deeply geopolitical and should pursue a new set of agreements over the rules of globalization it needs to have as its central aim the replacement of the us’s unilateral role as buyer of last resort with new arrangements that accomplish the same goal of providing demand especially at moments when global recessions loom but in a more equitable and sustainable wayfor its own longterm economic health it would be nice if the united states could just decide to remove the dollar from being the key reserve currency but it cannot and even if it could should not do so hastily a better approach would be for countries such as japan china germany and south korea to keep promises they have repeatedly made to switch from investment and exportled growth to internal consumption–led growtha weakness of the post–world war ii trading system has always been that there was discipline on countries who ran chronic trade deficits but none on countries who ran chronic surpluses what is needed now is for countries running chronic large trade surpluses to be subject to the discipline of surcharges on their exports and limits on the accumulation of foreign assetsthere should also be surcharges for other beggarthyneighbor behavior that threatens the global economy one of those is “dumping”—flooding world markets with products at below home market andorcostof production prices often as a result of overcapacity driven by exportled growth policies at the moment for example china has more than enough steel production capacity to supply total global demand all by itself this is ruining the steel industries of europe japan and the united states which otherwise are perfectly competitive another behavior deserving sanctions is the practice of countries offering subsidies—tax holidays free land training of workers capital grants utilities at half price—to lure companies to their shores companies that are competitive where they are governmentsupported hacking operations that steal corporate intellectual property also need to be reined inwe need a new set of international agreements over the rules of globalization the us’s unilateral role as buyer of last resort must be replaced with new arrangements whereby all the leading economies share the burden

my views about clintons claim that the country does better with a democrat in the white house clintons claims are nonsenseobama and reagan came into office under similar circumstanceseach had an early recession with unemployment peaking at  percent and reagan at  percent who had the bigger holeobamas recovery has registered  percent gdp growth whereas reagans scored  percent and for obama employment is up  percent but for reagan  percentfamily incomes are down about  on obama’s watch whereas those rose by  during the reagan yearsand the social indicators are terriblethe middle class is shrinking suicides and drug abuse are up fertility has dropped precipitously millions of college graduates stuck in lowpaying jobs and defaulting on education loans and home ownership is at a  year

go from meps the widely acclaimed clinton economy of the s was the direct result of two things  reagan laid the foundation for economic growth that both bush i and clinton experienced with large tax decreases reduced regulation and real economic growth and  the republicans taking control of the house and the contract with america that forced president clinton to the centerhe clinton did his best to screw it up with huge tax increases and the passage of nafta chinas move to favored nations trading status etc the results of these moves are what clinton really gave us ie  the  recession and

in tradeclyde once again is spot onwake up americadanwhen it comes to trade trump’s spoton    by clyde prestowitztribune news servicefor all his bullying narcissism and selfcontradiction there is one point on which presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump cannot be criticized in attacking our nation’s longtime free trade policies and deals the real estate tycoon has brought necessary attention to a huge elephant in america’s policy room one that’s run wild and must be stopped by the nation’s next leaderwhile trump’s been especially vocal on the topic he’s far from alone in taking this standbernie sanders the selfdescribed democratic socialist seeking the democratic party’s presidential nomination has also decried the “disastrous trade policies” of the past  yearsin fact even hillary clinton who most experts expect to beat sanders and face trump in november’s general election now says she opposes the transpacific partnership a free trade agreement that she while secretary of state described as the “gold standard” of trade dealsthis is a big shift for the past  years all presidential hopefuls have held up free trade as key to bringing about prosperity and peace to america and the worldnow following trump’s lead all this year’s candidates are saying washington’s way of promoting trade has in actuality been quite perilous and has undermined american prosperity to the advantage of our trading partnerswhat did trump so presciently seefirst he saw the problematic approach to trade policy taken by establishmentarians like robert zoelleck a former world bank president and deputy secretary of state who in a wall street journal oped this month argued for the tpp which has yet to be ratified by congress by focusing on the impact america’s trade agreements have had on national securityto insiders like zoelleck the main purpose of trade and globalization policy is not to enhance the incomes and welfare of ordinary americans it’s to shore up allies against russia and stop the chinese from doing what is never precisely articulatedthis position is held by the very people who uttered nary a whisper when general electric rather than investing back home decided to move its hightech aviation electronics division to shanghai through a joint venture with a stateowned chinese company these are the people who promoted and profited from the offshoring of millions of american manufacturing jobs in the name of making china a responsible stakeholder in the global economic systemto trump sanders and those who share their view such an approach is the height of inconsistencyneoclassical economists and the foreign policy establishment however see the nonreciprocal opening of american markets as an allegedly costfree way of buying friends and persuading countries with tiny economies to host us troops and join us in supporting supposedly critical issues at the united nationsthis approach has long been thought of as costfree because leading angloamerican economists — not mind you japanese korean german or singaporean economists — argued that free trade is always and everywhere a winwin propositionso opening american markets to foreign competition even when it’s been clear the competitors are operating under mercantilist exportled growth policies has been said to be a big win for the vast majority of americans of course it’s been admitted there will always be a few workers or companies who suffer displacement but it’s also been promised they’ll be compensated by the vast majority of winners that’s how it’s been argued anywayall this has been based on the counterintuitive concept of comparative advantage first articulated in  by british economist david ricardo and elaborated upon in the s by swedish economists eli heckscher and bertil ohlin the theory essentially holds that countries should concentrate on producing what they do best and trade for the restwhat countries produce best according the theory is determined by their endowments of land labor and capital and therefore countries like america with skilled labor and lots of land and capital ought to produce agricultural and advanced manufactured products and trade those for toys clothing and other products from countries with lots of cheap labor america ought to sell computer chips and airplanes to china in return for tshirts underwear and lychees the theory would saythis all sounded good for a long time but as noted in the early s by economist paul krugman this theory rested on a host of farfetched assumptions fixed exchange rates no crossborder flows of investment or technology constant full employment no cost of entry into or out of business no government intervention such as social security or minimum wages no unions and very importantly no economies of scalein other words the world of free trade theory has always been makebelieve and increasing globalization made it more soindeed in the late s ralph gomory a former chief scientist at ibm and william baumol a former president of the american economic association demonstrated that in the real world where many countries and products were experiencing rapid technological change immense crossborder flows of investment and technology and frequent fluctuations in economic growth and employment trade is as likely to be a zerosum i win you lose proposition as a winwin situation the outcome of trade all depends on the situation they concludedtrump and sanders probably haven’t read all these analyses but they have seen that none of the forecasts by republican or democratic administrations for new job creation and reduced trade deficits with japan china korea or other global partners ever came true for instance america’s  billion trade surplus with mexico has turned into a  billion deficit since the north american free trade agreement went into effect instead of shrinking america’s trade deficit with china — which stood at  billion in  — has ballooned to nearly  billion america’s free trade agreement with south korea has seen us exports decline imports double and  jobs quickly lostit’s hard to deny that trump and bernie have been

category letters from dan  dan dimicco dan dimicco dan dimicco blog champion movement subscribe to the blog american made   dan dimicco the impact of chinas trade practices is real   comments   a colleague working on his mba emailed me with questions for his research project this is my responsethank you for your email  you are correct that china’s abuse of global trade laws has a serious impact on the steel industry  they do employ a wide range of illegal trade practices to support their export driven manufacturing sector  this comes directly at the expense of the us steel industry and the us manufacturing sector as a whole  china was allowed entry into the world trade organization in  after agreeing to abide by the rules of global trade  since that time they have completely disregarded their commitments under the wto and as a result the us has lost over  million manufacturing jobs and our trade deficit with china has gone from  billion in  to  billion the largest trade imbalance we’ve ever recorded with a single countryfor our industry the impact of china’s trade practices has been a surge in chinese steel imports dumped in our market below the cost of production  last year china’s economy grew at its slowest pace in  years  despite this china’s steel production increased by   china accounted for  of world crude steel production last year far more than the demand of its domestic market  steel imports into the united states increased by  last year  imports from china increased by   this import surge was not driven by strong us demand  our economic growth continues to be slow and us steel mills are only running at  of capacity  the imports are increasing because subsidized steel from other countries notably china is being dumped in our market  the impacts are real  rg steel is selling its assets in bankruptcy and other us mills are on the market besides illegal subsidies and export quotas you should also examine chinese currency manipulation and china’s stateowned enterprises  china pegs its currency to the us dollar as opposed to letting the free market determine its value  by pegging its currency to the dollar china keeps its currency undervalued by up to as much as   this undervaluation makes chinese products cheaper in the us and our products more expensive in china’s market  this is china’s most potent trade weapon and has been the primary driver of our enormous trade deficit with china china also has several stateowned enterprises in the steel industry  stateowned enterprises are not private companies but government entities that follow government directives  as a result american companies are not competing against other private companies but against foreign governments which creates major market distortions  soes have advantages that most shareholderowned companies do not  they get access to massive and often illegal subsidies like cheap capital from stateowned banks  they get free land  their governments subsidize energy costs and exports  all these protectionist trade practices come together to feed their growthto combat these illegal trade practices the us and other countries must do more to enforce the rules of free trade  china has to face consequences for breaking the rules  nucor has brought several trade cases against china over a variety of steel products and we will bring more  their abuse of our open markets must stop  we will not reinvigorate our manufacturing sector and create the highpaying jobs that support the middle class unless we take strong trade enforcement action  also congress must pass legislation that labels china a currency manipulator and imposes penalties  there are solutions to these trade issues but it requires political will to implement these solutions i hope this helps you from a macrolevel  as i’ve often said publicly you can rest assured that we will continue to remain diligent and bring legal challenges against those countries responsible for the flood of imports that is not market driven its a very serious issue affects all of our products  it has traditionally been more so in the long products rebar and sheet but also now affects plate  until our government steps up and shows leadership on the solutions i mentioned above we’ll continue to fight and we’ll continue to winphoto source chinadailycomcm  comments subscribe name  first last

comments china attacks usa  wakeup america a continuation    comments   we have discussed the fact that we are in a war a trade war with china and have been for the last  years and we are losing big the trade data and trade deficit both annual and cumulative is staggering the job losses in manufacturing number over  the negative impact on our economy has been the main culprit in an abysmal  growth rate since  the message here today is tied to doing what is necessary and right to stimulate a stronger economy and greater job creation here at home and also around the globe not just in one country the world is in the same war and are just as ignorant of the factstoday i would like to introduce you to the game plan behind their attack on our economic future it is all spelled out in the book unrestricted warfare chinas master plan to destroy america or at the very least  do what we have to for china and to hell with everyone elsea good friend and champion recently wrote me and reminded me of our past efforts to get the powers that be in washington to understand what was going on and why and how our leaders basically turned a blind eye on the trade war facing us remember when i commented that the folks at ustr us trade representative we dealt with in the steel industry had never heard of it one took the challenge to read it and she couldn’t get the appointed leaders to do likewise  we deal in a vacuum of understanding when dealing with our adversaries  kum ba ya just doesn’t cut it in today’s world now if only everyone would read the most important document explaining the chinese strategy we could mount an effective counter balance and actively engage in this economic trade waras an example one of the biggest weapons in their arsenal and gameplan is to manipulate their currency it results in a huge illegal subsidy of  here is the quote in unrestricted warfare relating to currencyfor example in this era of economic integration if some economically powerful company wants to attack another countrys economy while simultaneously attacking its defenses it cannot rely completely on the use of readymade means such as economic blockades and trade sanctions or military threats and arms embargoes instead it must adjust its own financial strategy use currency revaluation or devaluation as primary and combine means  to make financial turbulence and economic crisis appear in the targeted country or area weakening its overall power including its military strengththis must become a concern that we all share not just a few we need to wake up america to this economic war being waged against us orsome people will say this is just china bashing a term they love to use instead of taking the time to educate themselves or just because it is in their financial geopolitical or ideological interests to use this term as a putdown that is and will be their shame and we will not be deterred in our efforts to educate trading partnersi think not no i know notamerica wake up  comments my thoughts on china   comments   this article was printed in american metals market last year  my thoughts regarding china havent changednew york — as much as  percent of today’s global steel industry is owned by government entities distorting the basic fundamentals of a marketdriven economy and leading to massive structural oversupply on a worldwide scale according to nucor corp executive chairman daniel r dimiccoone of the greatest banes of our industry for a long long time—decades—has been stateowned steel industries they’re not market driven they’re politically driven  and politically driven translates to massive overcapacity dimicco said in a keynote address at the steel success strategies xxviii conference in new york sponsored by amm and world steel dynamics inc englewood cliffs njbetween  and  percent of the global steel sector is controlled by state or national governments he said noting that such stateowned steelmaking companies are neither lowcost nor market driven resulting in a glut of subsidized capacity with no home but the world export market unfortunately we in the united states are the world’s dumping ground including for rebar and for other products dimicco saidaccording to organization for economic cooperation and development oecd estimates there is global demand for about  billion tonnes of steel per year but that’s far below the  billion to  billion tonnes of capacity fighting to supply that demand he saidmuch of that overcapacity is coming from china but turkey and other major steelmaking nations relying on a major export strategy are also to blame dimicco saidno nation should build  million tonnes of excess capacity they don’t need no matter what your growth trajectory is particularly when you can build steel mills as fast as the chinese can this shouldn’t be the case anywhere in the world a developing nation yes build a steel industry but don’t build one that depends on exports to survive he saidbuild it to create jobs in your country and drive economic growth internally but don’t be building it so you export  million of  million tonnes of your production that’s ridiculous dimicco said citing estimated export figures from turkey that is basically flaunting and making a laughing stock out of the concept of marketdriven economies and free tradethe solution he said is going to require pressure from the global steel sector and key governments around the worldto get ourselves out of this mess  it’s going to take enlightened leadership it’s going to take a global community that says enough is enough the distortions are too great it’s time to correct it he saiddimicco’s message to the global steel sector is clear stop exporting your overcapacity there’s too much in the world take your medicine at home and get rid of your antiquated excess capacity of which there are hundreds of millions of tonnesthe challenge in particular for china is you’ve done great things you’ve done things that no other country in the world has done a lot of good things miraculous things in what you’ve built but you’ve overdone it he added please get your act together and become part of the

economic growth where is the leadership   comments   for the last  years we have been pointing out to everyone in washington the need for job creation one of the right in your face solutions that matched a huge need to modernize our massive transportation infrastructure to replace the millions in job losses that occurred in all segments of the construction and related industries due to the great recession taking such action would also have created many many jobs in manufacturing and services of all kinds however the democrats chose not to when they controlled both houses of congress and the presidency instead focusing on arguably important issues but not the crisis they were made out to be like captrade and universal healthcare then the republicans focused on the budget deficit versus job creation so they have not acted to drive the rebuilding of our infrastructure either the budget deficit and debt issues are no doubt of serious concern to all of us but just as with the democrats focus on manmade global warmingread cap  traderead climate changeand universal healthcareread obamacare the rs failed to focus on the real crisis at handjob creation and economic stimulus any good let alone great leader knows the difference between long term problem solving and immediate crisis solvingthe reality was and is that goodgreat leadership is not present in washington hence they dont and didntso here we are still with the need to create  million new jobs over the next  years and still no recognition in concrete action of the true crisis before usjob creation and strong economic growth the anemic growth in both is proof of the failure in leadershipone very important point to make about the article below which focuses on gas tax increase to generate funds for infrastructure work which we should support for part of the funding needs is this the state governments and federal governments are currently using the taxes being raised today for infrastructure for other purposesdebt reductiongeneral funding needsnot infrastructure this must stop immediately if an increase in gas taxes is to have the desired impact on job creation and a strong economic stimulus this is a must have as part of any increase in the gas taxamericas challengewakeup we all must work together to be champions and activists  if we dont change the focus in washington to economic growth and job creation already  years behind the other long term issues we see as important will never really get dealt with how can we all not be for job creation and real growth in our economy todaylet all your elected officials both state and federal know what they need to do nowdan highway transportation fund needs a permanent and simple fixby editorial board july  at  pmwith the highway trust fund running dangerously low on cash threatening infrastructure projects across the country in the height of construction season members of congress seem to have settled on their latest shortterm gimmick to pay for the country’s roads and rails the only question left seems to be when they will try to do something better the answer should be immediatelywithout new funding the transportation department will begin slashing highway payouts tostates starting aug  few want to see that but lawmakers have been perpetually unable to fund the nation’s transportation budget responsibly so depressingly if predictably withanother funding crisis looming members of congress seem to agree on exploiting an arcane accounting trick called pension smoothing which could reduce the security of private pensions but would result in more federal revenue over a decade that decade’s worth of revenue will pay for several months of transportation spendingthis budget gimmickry is distasteful for several reasons starting with the fact that the plan spends money now over the course of less than a year that the government will make back over  years the idea is to give congress more time to sort out a permanent solution to the highway trust fund’s perpetual funding shortfalls but lawmakers don’t need more time they need more spinethe straightforward policy the one on which the highway trust fund historically has been based is to raise the gas tax to keep up with inflation and infrastructure needs this model is fair and efficient demanding that those who use the roads pay for them as a sustainable and predictable source of revenue a gas tax of sufficient size also would eliminate uncertainty about the level and source of government transportation fundingcongress could end the transportation funding crunch by adopting a bipartisan plan from sen bob corker rtenn and sen chris murphy dconn the proposal would raise the gas tax by  cents per gallon over two years and it would index the tax to inflation the last time congress raised the gas tax in  it failed to peg the tax to inflation which is largely why lawmakers are scrounging for money nowlawmakers should pass the corkermurphy plan instead they are fighting over when they will have to consider the longterm transportation funding issue many republicans want to push off the decisionmaking until next spring many democrats want to have the debate this december if lawmakers aren’t willing to accept the obvious funding plan in front of them before the november elections they should do so immediately afterward

boyd it points out how much work has yet to be done to create good paying jobs for all especially our young adults and how much has not been done we need strong leadership and action not sound bites for re election campaigningour economy and jobless are crying out to become a nation that creates makes and builds things againthe true wealth creation engine for all americans not just wall streetwe have discussed this many times before the solutions are in  correctingbalancing our trade deficit in manufactured goods and services by stopping trade mercantilism and focusing on rules based free trade and holding our trading partners accountable  rebuilding our infrastructure through meaningful investments that payback several fold  undoing excessive regulations on business that are destroying our global competitiveness  using our new found energy resources here at home to create more good paying jobscareers and rebuild our global competitiveness being sure to not allow a  freeforall exporting of these resources but a balanced approach  being sure that government policies are designed to encourage people to work not provide disincentives to work  get our tax system globally competitive and job creating instead of chasing jobs overseas for those that incorrectly blame a skills gap i say yes we always have a skills gap as innovation changes the world we are in but todays jobs crisis is not skills gap based it is based on not creating jobs for those who were gainfully employed prior to  with skills enough and lost their jobs this failure is rooted in ignoring the opportunities we had in spades to put them back to work rebuilding our infrastructure and making building things and the services that support all of it just what they were doing prior to the economy crashing it time our leaders woke up our left town and it is up to us to hold them accountable dont be swayed by false and hollow sound bites but demand substance from people of real experience not personality leave personality to hollywood and the talking heads in the press not to building a globally strong and competitive economy here at home dont be swayed by the happenings on wall street which have more to do with  low interest rates driving investorsamericans to look for better returns  being the prettiest ugly manwoman at the global economic dance  companies buying back their own stock  mergeracquisition mania brought about by painfully slow growth in the economy and easy money looking for a homereturnsnothing necessarily wrong with good times on wall street but without a dynamic growing economy it does not reach all americans in their paycheck or job aspirations america wakeup and do it togetherdan catherine rampell many life milestones are out of millennials reach lucas jacksonreutersby catherine rampell opinion writer september we want to move out we want to own our home we want to marry we want to workthe problem is many of us can’tamerica’s young adults have gotten a lot of flak for missing many of the milestones that earlier generations checked off with easewe aren’t getting even entrylevel jobs which could enable us to pay our own bills not only are we not buying houses many of us aren’t renting either about a third of millennials still live with their parents earning us the irksome epithet “boomerang generation” — a play on “boomer generation” the presumed victim herewe’re hanging out in our beleaguered parents’ basements rather than marrying and starting legally recognized unions of our own marriage rates have skidded downward with a little more than a quarter of  to yearolds ballandchained in  compared with about  percent at the dawn of the millennium according to calculations from the president’s council of economic advisers partly as a result more than half of the country is presently single the first time this has been the case since the government began keeping track in  singlehood hasn’t stopped many of us from continuing to reproduce of courseto some this arrested development is evidence of a prolonged adolescence and a rejection of selfsufficiency perhaps encouraged by indulgent “helicopter parenting” according to a recent ­reasonrupe survey about three­quarters of america’s young adults consider millennials to be “responsible” and “hardworking” while just half of older adults agree if character isn’t the issue perhaps it’s misplaced preferences we millennials have set aside the ideals of an “ownership society” in favor of the hippydippy values of a “sharing economy” we rent borrow or share our textbooks cars and evendinner leftovers so why would we bother buying a home or permanently attaching ourselves to a single romantic partnerrecent data though suggest that these standard americandreamstyle signposts still retain an incredibly strong hold over young people’s desires and aspirations what’s changed is that basic goals such as getting married having a secure job and owning a home have drifted further out of reacheven as marriage rates have plummeted — particularly for the young and the less educated — gallup survey data show that young singles very much hope to get hitched of americans age  to  only about  percent have both never been married and say they do not ever want to marry“although there is now a growing class divide in who gets and stays married in america there is virtually no divide in the aspiration to marry” says w bradford wilcox director of the national marriage project at the university of virginia “it doesn’t matter if you’re rich or poor white black or hispanic most americans are married or would like to marry the challenge then facing the united states is bridging the gap between the nearly universal aspiration to marry and the growing inability of poor and workingclass americans to access marriage”on to housing young americans are substantially less likely to own homes than their counterparts a generation or two ago with their homeownership rates reaching record lows this yearbut survey after survey shows that young people would love to be deedowners fannie mae’s national housing survey for example asks respondents whether they think it’s better to own or rent to achieve various goals such as feeling safe building wealth feeling engaged in their communities etc on almost every point young adults — just like their older brethren — say that owning is better the vast majority of millennials also say they’ll buy at some point if they haven’t already and they believe that the best reasons for owning are not financial but the “broader security and lifestyle benefits of homeownership”so what’s keeping young people from buying even as mortgage rates appear relatively cheap and from marrying even though possible mates are plentifuleconomic opportunity has a lot to do with both unemployment rates for the youngest adults remain high and they look far worse when you include people who aren’t actually looking for work but still say they want a job student loan debt also seems to be weighing on young people’s ability to buy as documented by the economists at the federal reserve bank of new york among othersperhaps preferences for these kinds of life milestones will eventually change too as norms evolve out of economic necessity but in the meantime don’t malign millennials for “rejecting” milestones that remain out of their reach  comments absolute mustread   comments   last week i posted on this blog that if its not the truth then its a lie well the must read article by mort zuckerman in todays wsj is the truthand he speaks to the the big liethose of you that have been following this blog and heard me speak over the last  years will recognize the message and the fact which speak to the lie and the spinwakeup americalets do it togetherdan wsj opinionthe fulltime scandal of parttime americafewer than half of us adults are working full time why slow growth and the perverse incentives of obamacareby mortimer zuckermanjuly    pm etthere has been a distinctive odor of hype lately about the national jobs report for june most people will have the impression that the  jobs created last month were fulltime not sothe obama administration and much of the media trumpeting the figure overlooked that the government numbers didnt distinguish between new parttime and fulltime jobs fulltime jobs last month plunged by  according to the bureau of labor statistics what has increased are parttime jobspart time jobs soared by about  to more than  million just think of all those americans working part time no doubt glad to have the work but also contending with lower pay diminished benefits and little job securityon july  president obama boasted that the jobs report showed the sixth straight month of job growth in the private economy make no mistake he said we are headed in the right direction what he failed to mention is that only  of adults in the us are working full time yes the percentage of unemployed has fallen but thats worth barely a bronx cheer it reflects the bleak fact that  million americans have become discouraged and dropped out of the workforce you might as well say that the unemployment rate would be zero if everyone quit looking for worklast month involuntary parttimers swelled to  million compared with  million in  way too many adults now depend on the lowwage parttime jobs that teenagers would normally fill federal reserve chair janet yellen had it right in march when she said the existence of such a large pool of partly unemployed workers is a sign that labor conditions are worse than indicated by the unemployment ratethere are a number of reasons for our predicament most importantly a historically low growth rate for an economic recovery gross domestic product growth in  was a feeble  and it fell at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of  in the first quarter of but there is one clear political contribution to the dismal jobs trend many employers cut workers hours to avoid the affordable care acts mandate to provide health insurance to anyone working  hours a week or more the unintended consequence of president obamas signature legislation fewer fulltime workers in many cases two people are working the same number of hours that one had previously workedsince mid the us population has grown by  million according to the census bureau but we have  fewer jobs since a november  peak and are  million jobs shy of where we should be it is particularly upsetting that our current high unemployment is concentrated in the oldest and youngest workers older workers have been phased out as new technologies improve productivity and young adults who lack skills are struggling to find entrylevel jobs with advancement opportunities in the process they are losing critical time to develop workplace habits contacts and new skillsmost americans wouldnt call this an economic recovery yes were not technically in a recession as the recovery began in mid but highwage industries have lost a million positions since  lowpaying jobs are gaining and now account for  of all employment growth since employment hit bottom in february  with by far the most growth— million jobs—in lowwage industries the number of longterm unemployed remains at historically high levels standing at more than three million in june the proportion of americans in the labor force is at a year low  down from  in parttime jobs are no longer the domain of the young many are taken by adults in their prime working years— to  years of age—and many are single men and women without highschool diplomas why is this happening it cant all be attributed to the unforeseen consequences of the affordable care act the longer workers have been out of a job the more likely they are to take a parttime job to make ends meetthe result faith in the american dream is eroding fast the feeling is that the rules arent fair and the system has been rigged in favor of business and against the average person the share of financial compensation and outputs going to labor has dropped to less than  today from about  before why havent increases in labor productivity translated into higher household income in private employment in part because of very low rates of capital spending on new plant and equipment over the past five years in the s only one in  american men between the ages of  and  was not working according to former treasury secretary larry summers in  years that number will be one in seventhe lack of breadwinners working full time is a burgeoning disaster there are  million people in the us in lowwage jobsthose workers wont be able to spend what is necessary in an economy that is mostly based on consumer spending and this will put further pressure on growth what we have is a very high unemployment rate a slow recovery and acrosstheboard wage stagnation except for the top few percent according to the bureau of labor statistics almost  million people over age  arent working a record high when barack obama became president that figure was nearly  million lowerthe great american job machine is spluttering we are going through the weakest postrecession recovery the us has ever experienced with growth half of what it was after four previous recessions and thats despite the most expansive monetary policy in history and the largest fiscal stimulus since world war iithat is why the june numbers are so distressing five years after the great recession more than  million workingage americans remain jobless working parttime involuntarily or having left the workforce we are not in the middle of a recovery we are in the middle of a muddlethrough and theres no point in pretending that the sky is blue when so many millions can attest to dark cloudsmr zuckerman is chairman and editor in chief of us news  world report   comments if its not the truth its a lie   comments   the exaggerations continue regarding the health of the economy remember what happens in the stock market is not a good gage of the economy when interest rates are so low why because investors have little other choice to hopefully get good returns the cheap money also drives acquisitionmergertakeover activity and this is going on in spades readextreme behavior that leads us to the failures of the last decadethe

day   comments   must read of the dayamerica the real unemployment rate is over  not  wakeup and let your congressional officials and the president know that you know its way past time to hold them accountable real unemployment rate is at least  percent peter moricifriday the labor department is expected to report the economy added  jobs in july and the unemployment rate remained steady at  percent but that hardly tells the storythe jobless rate may be down from its recession peak of  percent but much of this results from adults discouraged by the lack of decent job openings have quit altogether they are neither employed nor looking for workonly about half of the drop in the adult participation rate may be attributed to the baby boom generation reaching retirement age lacking adequate resources to retire a larger percentage of adults over  are working than before the recessionmany americans who would like full time jobs are stuck in parttime positions because businesses can hire desirable parttime workers to supplement a core of permanent fulltime employees but at lower wages and obamacare’s employer health insurance mandates will not apply to workers on the job less than  hours a weeksince  congress has enhanced the earned income tax credit and expanded programs that provide direct benefits to lowincome workers including food stamps medicaid obamacare and rent and mortgage assistancevirtually all phase as family incomes rise either by securing higher hourly pay or working more hours and impose an effective marginal tax rate as high as  percent  consequently these programs discourage work and skills acquisition and encourage single parents and one partner in two adult households not to work often these motivate single people to work only parttimeundocumented immigrants face more difficulties accessing these programs and lax immigration enforcement permits them to openly take jobs that government benefits discourage lowincome americans from acceptingemployers can intentionally or unintentionally abuse the hb visa program which permit businesses to employ foreign workers when qualified americans are unavailable americans may be overlooked because they demand higher wages or are not networked with immigrants that are already employed in technical and managerial positionsthe economy has created only about  million new jobs during the bushobama years whereas the comparable figure during the reaganclinton period was about  million a recent study by the center for immigration studies indicates that virtually all the new jobs created since  went to immigrants whereas none were created for nativeborn americansadding in discouraged adults who say they would begin looking for work if conditions were better those working parttime but say they want full time work and the effects of immigration the unemployment rate becomes about  percent—and that is a lower bound estimatemany young people are being duped both by unscrupulous for profit postsecondary institutions—as well as accredited colleges and universities with low admission standards—to enroll in useless programs they would likely be in the labor force now but for easy access to federally sponsored loans and will end up heavily in debtadding in these students the real unemployment rate among us citizens and permanent residents is at least  percentsince  gdp growth has averaged  per year whereas during the reaganclinton years it was  percent the reluctance of both presidents bush and obama to confront chinese protectionism and currency

last  years we have been pointing out to everyone in washington the need for job creation one of the right in your face solutions that matched a huge need to modernize our massive transportation infrastructure to replace the millions in job losses that occurred in all segments of the construction and related industries due to the great recession taking such action would also have created many many jobs in manufacturing and services of all kinds however the democrats chose not to when they controlled both houses of congress and the presidency instead focusing on arguably important issues but not the crisis they were made out to be like captrade and universal healthcare then the republicans focused on the budget deficit versus job creation so they have not acted to drive the rebuilding of our infrastructure either the budget deficit and debt issues are no doubt of serious concern to all of us but just as with the democrats focus on manmade global warmingread cap  traderead climate changeand universal healthcareread obamacare the rs failed to focus on the real crisis at handjob creation and economic stimulus any good let alone great leader knows the difference between long term problem solving and immediate crisis solvingthe reality was and is that goodgreat leadership is not present in washington hence they dont and didntso here we are still with the need to create  million new jobs over the next  years and still no recognition in concrete action of the true crisis before usjob creation and strong economic growth the anemic growth in both is proof of the failure in leadershipone very important point to make about the article below which focuses on gas tax increase to generate funds for infrastructure work which we should support for part of the funding needs is this the state governments and federal governments are currently using the taxes being raised today for infrastructure for other purposesdebt reductiongeneral funding needsnot infrastructure this must stop immediately if an increase in gas taxes is to have the desired impact on job creation and a strong economic stimulus this is a must have as part of any increase in the gas taxamericas challengewakeup we all must work together to be champions and activists  if we dont change the focus in washington to economic growth and job creation already  years behind the other long term issues we see as important will never really get dealt with how can we all not be for job creation and real growth in our economy todaylet all your elected officials both state and federal know what they need to do nowdan highway transportation fund needs a permanent and simple fixby editorial board july  at  pmwith the highway trust fund running dangerously low on cash threatening infrastructure projects across the country in the height of construction season members of congress seem to have settled on their latest shortterm gimmick to pay for the country’s roads and rails the only question left seems to be when they will try to do something better the answer should be immediatelywithout new funding the transportation department will begin slashing highway payouts tostates starting aug  few want to see that but lawmakers have been perpetually unable to fund the nation’s transportation budget responsibly so depressingly if predictably withanother funding crisis looming members of congress seem to agree on exploiting an arcane accounting trick called pension smoothing which could reduce the security of private pensions but would result in more federal revenue over a decade that decade’s worth of revenue will pay for several months of transportation spendingthis budget gimmickry is distasteful for several reasons starting with the fact that the plan spends money now over the course of less than a year that the government will make back over  years the idea is to give congress more time to sort out a permanent solution to the highway trust fund’s perpetual funding shortfalls but lawmakers don’t need more time they need more spinethe straightforward policy the one on which the highway trust fund historically has been based is to raise the gas tax to keep up with inflation and infrastructure needs this model is fair and efficient demanding that those who use the roads pay for them as a sustainable and predictable source of revenue a gas tax of sufficient size also would eliminate uncertainty about the level and source of government transportation fundingcongress could end the transportation funding crunch by adopting a bipartisan plan from sen bob corker rtenn and sen chris murphy dconn the proposal would raise the gas tax by  cents per gallon over two years and it would index the tax to inflation the last time congress raised the gas tax in  it failed to peg the tax to inflation which is largely why lawmakers are scrounging for money nowlawmakers should pass the corkermurphy plan instead they are fighting over when they will have to consider the longterm transportation funding issue many republicans want to push off the decisionmaking until next spring many democrats want to have the debate this december if lawmakers aren’t willing to accept the obvious funding plan in front of them before the november elections they should do so immediately afterward when the political atmosphere may be more conducive to doing the right thing more

quality and technological leadership none of nucors plants whether built from scratch or acquired are unionized and nucor is opposed to unions believing them to be a destructive force in the us steel industry no nucor plant has ever held a successful union certification election even though nucor management has not engaged in the controversial union busting tactics adopted by some companies and has never laid off an employee due to a work shortage nucor workers refer to themselves as teammates working together towards a common goal decisions are pushed down to the person closest to the problem instead of up to management that allows decisions and improvements to be made faster and often better decentralized management philosophyedit nucor is highly decentralized in its operations there are only five managerial levels at nucor supervisorprofessional department manager division general manager executive vice president and presidentceocitation needed most operating decisions are made at the division level or lower in addition nucor claims that its corporate office staff numbers around  employees which may be the smallest number of corporate office employees among major

based primarily on the percentage of net income to dollars of assets employed for their division these bonuses can be as much as  percent of a department managers base pay professional and clerical bonus plan this bonus is paid to employees not on the production or department manager plan and is based on the divisions net income return on assets senior officers incentive plan nucors senior

provided traditional perks such as company cars executive parking spaces or executive dining rooms though in august  the company did purchase a corporate jet for use by senior managementcitation needed a letter was sent to the home of every nucor explaining the why the jet was needed it was important to nucor’s management that the employees were aware of the change and had a chance to voice their opinion ken iverson’s book plain talk specifically pointed out that nucor didn’t have a company plane so it was seen as a big change several programs such as nucors profit sharing scholarship program employee stock purchase plan extraordinary bonus and service awards program are not available to nucors officers but only to lowerlevel employees each annual report since  has listed the names of every employee in the nucor  annual report it took  pages to list the names of all  employees technological leadershipedit in  nucor was among the first steel companies in the united states to use

and labor required to produce sheet steel in  nucor recycled nearly  million cars in its production processes the equivalent of one suv every four secondscitation needed currently nucor in conjunction with two foreignowned steel companies operates two facilities in crawfordsville indiana and blytheville arkansas that continuously cast sheet steel directly from molten steel without the need for heavy expensive and energyconsuming rollers the process known as castrip allows an entire mill to be built in  the space of a minimill and at  the cost of a traditional integrated mill they call this
