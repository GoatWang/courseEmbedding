after the death of a spouse where we were not executors this scenario included two highly emotional surprises the first surprise occurred when the spouse who was to receive the entire estate learned she was not appointed executor as had been requested in error their attorney had named her children who were originally to be placed as backup executors with the guidance of pennsylvania trust the daughters renounced their executorships and the widow probated the will as administrator with our help the second surprise occurred when the widow learned that the deceased spouse had a sixfigure credit card debt she had no idea that spending was done via credit and therefore there were no probate assets to pay the debts leading her initially to believe that her separate assets might have to be used pennsylvania trust found an attorney to administer the insolvent estate and ensure that the widow would not have to pay the debt with her own assets she thought she would be forced to sell her home transfer title to all of her assets and have a dramatically diminished lifestyle in both of these highly emotional developments pennsylvania trust was able to provide a steady hand utilizing
