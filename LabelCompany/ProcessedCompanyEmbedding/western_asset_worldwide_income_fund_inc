objectives february    am eastern standard time new yorkbusiness wirewestern asset emerging markets income fund inc nyseemd western asset worldwide income fund inc nysesbw and western asset emerging markets debt fund inc nyseesd today announced approval by each fund’s board of directors of a proposal to merge i emd with and into esd and ii sbw with and into esd subject to approval by the stockholders of each fund the approval of each merger is not contingent upon the approval of the other merger if approved the mergers are anticipated to occur during the third quarter of  if the proposed mergers are approved by the stockholders of each fund stockholders of emd and sbw would receive common stock of esd based on each fund’s respective net asset value per share in lieu of issuing fractional shares esd will pay cash to each former stockholder of emd and sbw in an amount equal to the value of the fractional shares of esd common stock that the investor would otherwise have received in the merger management and each board of directors believe it is in the best interests of stockholders to merge emd and sbw with and into esd in part because the combined fund may benefit from economies of scale as one set of fixed expenses would be spread over a larger asset base as well as from enhanced market liquidity furthermore stockholders of emd sbw and esd would likely

different investment objectives emd’s primary investment objective is to seek high current income as a secondary objective emd seeks capital appreciation sbw’s primary investment objective is to
