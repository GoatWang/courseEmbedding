covered call  equity strategy fund nyse mcn mcn and together with msp the funds on may   the funds issued a press release announcing that the board of trustees of each fund approved the proposed merger the proposed merger is clearly not a solution that best serves shareholders interests it is dilutive to msp shareholders ownership and greatly benefits madison asset management by maximizing fee revenues shareholders of msp voted last year to receive full value for their shares but the board chose to ignore them now the board is reinstating a proposal that they introduced last year and subsequently cancelled stated brett d gardner senior corporate governance analyst at karpus investment management gardner further stated this is precisely why we submitted trustee nominees for both funds it is also why we submitted a a shareholder proposal to terminate the investment adviser as well as an additional proposal requesting that each funds board promptly consider authorizing a selftender offer for all outstanding common shares of each fund at or close to net asset value since shareholders approved the nonbinding proposal at msps  annual meeting and msps sister fund mcn is comprised of three trustees that all serve on msps board we believe madison must be terminated and new independent trustees must be elected to enhance shareholder value as evidenced by the funds recent merger press release the boards of msp and mcn appear more interested in the bottom line of the investment adviser as opposed to listening to shareholders and maximizing shareholder value he concluded because of this we believe the time has come to elect new trustees allow shareholders to realize close to full value for their shares and to terminate madison asset management as the funds
