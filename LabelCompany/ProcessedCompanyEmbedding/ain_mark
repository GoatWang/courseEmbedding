minor changes to improve the quality of reproduction we may remove the registration number ie “n number” or tail number or other identifying markings on an aircraft in a photo upon request and we will always remove such markings if their presence could give a wrong impression eg if an aircraft that had nothing to do with illegal activity is used to illustrate a story about such activity in some situations such as reporting characteristics of an aircraft the only viable information source will be the manufacturer when it is not practical to independently verify facts we will make the source of the information clear in seeking information our staff and freelance writers will be honest about the purpose of their inquiries when individuals or representatives of companies are unwilling or unable to comment on a situation the resulting article will make clear that we gave them an opportunity to do so when seeking a comment reporters will give a deadline for responding when we publish allegations against or criticisms of individuals or companies their responses will appear as closely as possible to each point made in addition the story will clearly describe who is making these points and what vested interest he or she may have objectivity we maintain strict separation between advertising and all editorial content whether or not a company is an advertiser will have no effect on whether or how we cover it in our editorial pages editorial considerations and readers’ needs will dictate all coverage decisions content and supplements produced for and funded by advertisers will be clearly identified as such so that there will be no doubt in the mind of a typical reader that the advertising content is not pure editorial articles will not be a platform for reporters’ viewpoints the obvious exception opinion pieces such as editorial commentaries blogs and reviews of aircraft autos etc staff writers and editors should not work for individuals or companies in the aviation industry or for other aviation magazines freelance writers who work for ain publications may work for other publications unless stipulated otherwise in their retainer agreement with ain moreover ain editors and staff and freelance writers should not directly own stock in companies they write about however it is acceptable for stock in these companies to be held by mutual funds in which our writers and editors invest as shareholders in funds do not control trading of their stocks prepublication drafts we generally do not provide manuscripts to sources or article subjects in advance of publication though we may occasionally make exceptions to this rule eg if an article contains complex technical information that would benefit from external review in these situations however we will typically allow someone to review only portions of an article and we will retain the right to veto any suggested changes travel assistance accepting company hospitality or assistance with travel plans could compromise our independence on the other hand this is sometimes the only practical way to participate in a company briefing or other event we may accept such assistance if it involves a group media visit or an event in which other publications and reporters are participating we will not accept invitations to travel at the expense of a company if no other media are participating however there may sometimes be circumstances such as bjt’s getaways series and demonstrations of aircraft for pilot reports in which journalists are individually invited to fly the aircraft on different dates where this policy is not viable in these situations the editors will decide whether accepting hospitality or assistance would compromise our independence accountability when we receive a complaint about an article we will quickly review it if we’ve erred we will apologize to the parties concerned and where appropriate publish a correction or clarification if a company or individual writes to make a noteworthy point that contradicts an article we’ve published we will make every effort to publish the letter in this case the article writer will be offered the chance to make a counterresponse unnamed sources if a source asks to tell a reporter something off the record before saying it we will treat the statement only as background information that cannot be published while we seek to avoid unnamed sources there may be circumstances when a credible source does not want to be or cannot be named in such cases we will consider the source’s motives in making the comments and seeking anonymity the appropriate publication editor and ain publications editorinchief in consultation with legal counsel and others if needed will be the judge as to whether use of the unnamed source is in the public interest when we do use unnamed sources we will make every effort to corroborate information independently moreover we will give as much information as possible about their background and any vested interest they may have especially where sources are being critical of a third party they must provide strong supporting evidence for such comments quotes as a general rule direct quotations will not be edited especially in qaformatted interviews however we may do minor rephrasing and tightening up of grammar to improve readability editing should never change the point of what someone is saying reader feedback without contacting the writer we may publish letters and emails that have been submitted for publication and comments that have been posted on our websites however whenever possible we will contact the writer of the letter or email to confirm that the person did in fact write it if the possibility exists that a letter or email was not intended for publication we will obtain the writer’s permission before using it requests by letter and email writers that their identities not be published will be subject to the same scrutiny as unnamed sources httpwwwainonlinecomaboutainpublications awards won by ain publications aviation international news  conventionshow dailies aerospace journalist of the year awards  best air show daily

oldest of five children parent of three and leader of one of the largest software developers in massachusetts for  years the role of mentor has been a natural and lifelong post for mark ain the son of businesssavvy parents — a selfemployed father a mother who was one of the first women to graduate from columbia law school and entrepreneurial grandparents — ain exhibited his own entrepreneurial spirit and leadership skills early in life growing up on long island new york ain took an active role in raising his younger siblings after graduating from high school where he was on the varsity wrestling team captain of the math team and passionate about photography ain went on to college at the massachusetts institute of technology mit where he knew he would eventually start his own company telling classmates i will make my own way and be successful in addition to a bachelors degree in electrical engineering from mit ain earned a masters degree in business administration with a concentration in organizational development and marketing from the simon school at the university of rochester after a variety of jobs including a stint with digital equipment corporation and a small market research firm ain grew tired of the corporate game and weary of relinquishing creative ideas only to see them not executed to their full potential he began a quest for the right product idea to start a company during this period he was an independent management consultant focused on strategic planning product development and market research for technology companies it was then that the mechanical time clock came to his attention with the idea to put a microprocessor inside a time clock ain set to work on a prototype on october   kronos® was incorporated named for the greek word for time in june  after an initial round of angel capital funding the company moved into an old ironworks plant in brighton mass including the proceeds of its  initial public offering the company raised only  million in funding — a remarkably small amount for what is now a billiondollar company ain led kronos from  to become one of the worlds most successful software companies under ains leadership kronos sustained one of the longest records of growth and profitability in the software industry and earned the reputation as the market leader in workforce management today as a member of the board of directors ain remains involved in kronos operations he also serves on the board of directors of several public private and charitable organizations on a personal level ain enjoys supporting a number of charitable organizations ains success can be credited in part to his quiet and humane management style which is best reflected by a motto of philosopher laotzu a leader is best when people barely know he exists not so good when people obey and acclaim him worse when they despise him but of a good leader who talks little when his work is done and his aim fulfilled they will say we did it
