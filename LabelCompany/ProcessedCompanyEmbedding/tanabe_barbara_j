march   in honolulu hawaii donita moorhus interviewer go to session one  session two index  cover  home page  begin tape  side a moorhus back to  tanabe thats a good year moorhus yes twenty years ago when you came to khon start at the beginning you told me last time about the way you got the offer to come here did komo in seattle offer you anything as a balance to this offer did they try to keep you tanabe yes they asked me to stay because id only been there four years and i was doing quite well part of the reason im sure is because i got off to a real good start with an emmy and with a documentary and i was able to establish credibility quite well plus i was doing quite a number of reports through abc moorhus through the network tanabe through the network every affiliate through the network is able to send stories if the network feels its something of value and so i was starting to get fairly good nationwide attention my parents who were on okinawa at the time also were able to see stories that i had done because for some reason the military was able to pick up on some of them so i suppose that komo considered me to be an asset but my feeling was that what was offered in hawaii was something that i would not be able to get in seattle for a very long time and that was number one the higher visibility as an anchor and that always adds in the professional life of a television journalist it adds to the stature and it also broadens my own portfolio as a television broadcaster the second point was that it offered me an opportunity to go more into the management of the news operation in the four years that i was at komo i wasnt that interested in it at the time because i was more interested in establishing myself getting the respect of my colleagues making a mark for myself as a reporter and getting some of that down pat i was really ready to move on to something else professionally and personally too for the first time in a long time some of the family obligations had been settled to a certain extent and so my husband and i were freer to be able to pull up roots and move somewhere else at the time it was just a threeyear contract so i was assuming that perhaps i would be back of course thats twenty years ago it was a long contract laughter moorhus there was also an attraction to this culture is that right tanabe yes there was a very strong attraction especially after i had checked around and found that there had been no local or nonwhite male anchor at the television station and i just felt that was wrong it was totally wrong because a newscast should really reflect the community which it serves page  page  not only in the kinds of stories that are carried the types of individuals who are interviewed as leaders but those who provide the news or deliver the news because it makes a very visible impact on the community ive always felt that was important and so i felt it was very necessary plus hawaii was just a different community id never operated in a community outside of the mainland us in which i was not a minority quite frankly after years of growing up as a minority and always having to be very careful about what i said and being almost not embarrassed but very sensitive about how i presented my japanese tradition you get a little tired of it you want to be in a situation where you dont have to spell your name out to everybody or when youre at a department store people dont come up to you and ask if youre the employee and that happened all the time moorhus or if you speak english tanabe or if i speak english that was quite a common question and it just kind of gets to you not that it bothered me to a great deal but after a while you just want to know what its like not to be questioned like that all the time so we took this major leap and we came over here i told you that when i got into television friends of mine asked me isnt it insulting that they hired you only because you were a nonwhite nonmale and i said no because its my foot in the door this was a similar situation where someone calls up totally out of the blue and wants to hire me because im still a nonwhite nonmale so i havent been able to shake that but again my feeling was i can do the job and it is another opportunity and im going to do it and im going to do it well thats why we felt that we would come we came on june eighteenth as i recall and then i started working on the twentyfirst so in three days moorhus so in both of those situations your being female and nonwhite was a plus tanabe oh yes definitely a plus there was no doubt about that moorhus thats interesting because of course it runs counter to many of the other women ive talked to where being female was always something they had to fight against it was never an opportunity tanabe but i think thats what we mean by affirmative action that there have been barriers established through whatever you want to call it whether its institutional racism or fear or lack of understanding whatever you want to call it there were barriers there against minorities going into certain fields and against women reaching certain levels of a profession if affirmative action could in some way make a dent in that by giving preferential treatment to those who are capable then i think it was a great program it helped me a lot it helped many many other individuals in all kinds of professions not just journalism so i think it was very necessary to at least break down some of the barriers give minorities a chance because there are institutional barriers that run so deep its very difficult to crack now in this situation i remember you asked me did i have problems as a female i think i was more concerned with problems of a minority and being female was just another handicap here and im just going to have to resolve it and so in many ways i think i was able to handle it a little bit better than if i were for instance a white female and not having to also wear this minority label and being blamed for a war and all those other past sins if i were a white female page  page  and i didnt have to battle that all of my life and instead was just concentrating on how am i going to turn peoples attitude around because im a woman that for a white female becomes a huge problem but for me i had all kinds of other things to worry about so in proportion even though i might have had the same problems as a female it wasnt as large as all the other ones that id been facing moorhus it was just one of many problems tanabe it was one of many so when i say to you i dont think it was as bad im not being insensitive to it i realize it was there but im trying to put this whole thing into perspective moorhus that it was just one of many battles tanabe it was one of many it was one of many battles and there were battles i remember�and i told you this�even at komo i was often relegated to do these features and i did them quite well but after a while you say well look this is a pattern its not a fair pattern because you are creating a stereotype upon me that i do not wish to be a part of i am a reporter im a journalist first and foremost yes im minority and yes im female but that should not have a bearing on how well i can do a story and so i always made that point quite clear to the news director and i think i said it in a nice enough way so that i didnt create any sense of a militant feminist although in many ways i felt that my point was as blunt as necessary in order to make the message clear and thank goodness i worked with a number of men who were very secure in their knowledge that they were also good journalists so they were more than willing to share some of their experiences and give advice to others moorhus when you came here to hawaii did you get the kind of acceptance as a minority thats now part of the majority that you had hoped for tanabe oh yes i think so it was interesting i had so many phone calls and messages from people who were my parents generation its very interesting not necessarily my generation which at that time would be in the twenties but the parents generation they were so proud that finally somebody who looked like them was able to go into a profession that before had been kind of excluded from something they normally would do if you look at the makeup of the japaneseamericans and their experience in hawaii many of them went into professional positions�teachers engineers lawyers architects those types which require skill and knowledge and higher education because the japanese put a great premium on education very few of them went into things like journalism business the arts because those were areas in which if you did not speak the language well or werent able to express yourself well in the western culture you did not do well so there were very few people in those areas now in business is quite a different matter in the early fifties and going back even into the forties it was understood that if you were local which means you were a person of color you probably were not going to get into the executive ranks of management because there was a very tight control and there were small networks of individuals who were able to control business this is very well documented in hawaiian history so its really not necessary for me to go into it a great deal but that was kind of the way it was so you had very few people going into these areas page  page  now twenty years later yes there are more people but still not as many top executives or representatives as maybe there should have been so for me to all of a sudden appear on television in a very prominent role to them was almost like hey we did it we got one of our own in there i was a generation younger but it really was because of things that they had done they were my fathers generation and they were the ones that really took the brunt of having to prove themselves during the war im sure youve heard about the nd and all of the things that the japaneseamericans had to go through they were the ones that really made the ultimate sacrifice of serving in combat while their families were under severe discrimination back at home but they were able to do it and then when they came back they went to school and they broke down even more barriers so they really were the fighters of the japaneseamericans and in many ways i was the one that was able to eat the fruits the seeds that they planted blossomed into wonderful things and i was able to take advantage of it i always remembered that and so whenever i did anything i was extremely careful that it was always the best possible job that i could do as a journalist not necessarily most favorable to locals or japaneseamericans or anything like that because journalists are supposed to be objective and so i did the best job that i could and i was as professional as possible moorhus was there any suspicion or resistance were you identified with the mainland and did that have any negative connotations here tanabe i suppose i was identified with the mainland because of the way i speak i dont speak pidgin which is sort of like the local shorthand version of english i still dont have the hang of it after all these years instead of saying how are you did you have a nice day its just hows it laughter ive always felt that its a very colorful language and i think its wonderful that people can use it and communicate among themselves with it and yet they can switch off to standard english if necessary i think its a wonderful ability to have so yes they identified me as a mainlander and at first especially during the war there may have been some kinds of tensions but i dont think it was true in my case i mean i get ribbings every now and then about aha another kotonk moorhus another what tanabe kotonk thats the nickname that they use for mainland japaneseamericans moorhus how do you spell that tanabe kotonk but i think its more in good humor fun more than anything else i remember having very long discussions with friends of mine here in hawaii about the way i sometimes bristle when we talk about how asians and blacks are treated to them its no big thing it was so much water off a ducks back i said how could you not get involved in issues like busing for instance they said because it doesnt affect us here barbara we know who we are we dont have to prove ourselves anymore   nd infantry regiment  us army unit made up of ajas americans of japanese ancestry from hawaii who volunteered for service in world war ii among members of the nd who served with distinction in the european theater were later senator daniel inouye and later senator spark matsunaga page  page  yet on the mainland were constantly having to prove ourselves because were minorities and were questioned all the time�all the time over here when youre the majority its no big deal theres more confidence in themselves as japaneseamericans they could go and eat sushi anywhere they want and they didnt have to apologize when they had an office party and they served rice and chopsticks they were very comfortable knowing that they were japanese and americans and it didnt bother them that took me a while to get used to i guess it is the majority mentality but it is very comfortable i remember interviewing a very wellknown political leader about this and then we got to talking afterwards i told him how hawaiians are so different from being on the mainland you let things slide as if it didnt bother you and on the mainland wed file a suit it was that extreme he said well barbara thats okay because what it does is it reinforces your understanding of yourself as an individual my son is going to grow up here in hawaii until hes a man until hes eighteen until hes comfortable with his face and his heritage and can defend himself and then after that im going to send him to the mainland because he needs to know what the other world is like he is going to be challenged but by that time hes going to have his values in place his confidence in place and hell be able to defend himself ive thought about it this interview took place twenty years ago and the gentleman has long since passed away but i always thought about what dan told me and i said you know he was absolutely right that you have to grow up being confident in yourself not having to constantly defend yourself and then you can be a stronger individual i grew up the other way constantly having to fight for everything that i wanted to do and that created this hardened shell around me that i had to soften a little bit here in hawaii moorhus it reminds me of the interviews i did with dorothy gilliam a black journalist with the washington post who is probably ten years older than you are i dont remember exactly she grew up in segregated schools in the south and she said that it removed one more of the pressures of life does that ring true to you tanabe i think that is true here in hawaii not too many individuals can develop with so many pressures all around you its very difficult i was fortunate in that i was a good reader and i found escapes and ways to protect myself but for kids nowadays theres all kinds of pressures it would be tough and i think it is true i think its very important for one to be confident in ones self and not have to kind of always be aware that youre different and therefore maybe not all right thats not a good feeling when youre growing up it really isnt now being female again if you look at the asian tradition oh man talk about macho chauvinist types of cultures its there however theres also a great deal of respect for anyone thats very professional and so i think i was able to surmount the barrier with a lot of the audience that i projected myself to i think i was able to avoid a lot of these sexist remarks that are always attributed toward me first of all im not a sexylooking person im just kind of ordinarylooking theres nothing�i look like anyones sister or daughter i look kind of nonthreatening so therefore maybe in some way i was able to sidestep those questions of what are women doing on television oh theyre just there for looks well obviously i didnt get there page  page  just for looks and so in many ways from the audience perspective i was able to downplay the sexism label within the news operation i think i still had to work on it because there were questions about whether i had the ability to be a manager in the news operation plus there was already a news director so that was a little bit more sensitive a more delicate area that i had to work on moorhus and you came in as an assistant news director and coanchor immediately tanabe yes assistant news director and coanchor moorhus this coanchor was at what time tanabe it was on at i think it was  i cant remember what the exact time was but it was early evening newscast and the late evening newscast over here the late news is at ten its this earlytobed earlytorise market and so i did both in a coanchor situation moorhus did you get to do some reporting as well from the beginning tanabe yes i did from the very beginning because it was my choice the news director did not his background was mostly reading the news it really wasnt in reporting there are different ways that people come into that role as you know in the seventies some people just looked good and sounded good and so therefore they become what we call talent or readers there are others who are very serious journalists and i considered myself always to be a reporter first and an anchor second and so i did a lot of reporting all the time and writing moorhus we want to talk about some of the stories that you did one of the things you mentioned after our interview last week was one of the things this job did is give you opportunities for a lot of travel tanabe oh yes it did moorhus and wed like to talk about that one of the first trips you mentioned was to guam tanabe yes after the fall of vietnam after saigon was captured april   and it became ho chi minh city there were thousands and thousands of vietnamese from south vietnam who had aided the american cause who now feared for their lives and they escaped by whatever means possible�boats planes however to get out of the country the united states and the united nations refugee high commissioner�and you know details now are hazy to me but they were able to use guam as sort of a base to process these refugees and then find sponsors for them and move them into the united states or other countries which would accept the vietnamese refugees i felt it was important for me as a reporter to be able to cover this event for our audience in hawaii this goes back to again it may not have been an issue that people were talking about all the time here in hawaii because it doesnt affect them so what there are a bunch of refugees coming out of vietnam but its something that we should be talking about because we as a nation in our own way created this problem and now we have a group that whether its our responsibility or not we were going to help out in some way it was postwar effects that we page  page  should be dealing with and because we are closest to guam and vietnam in some way it was going to affect us and sure enough there were churches here that were sponsoring some of the vietnamese refugees and so i was able to track down some of this and then fly to guam track down the families and start doing a series of interviews and then broaden it to what were the other vietnamese refugees doing what were the factions within these various camps what was the high commissioner going to do and so i did a series of reports on the refugees id been to guam several times before and i remember thinking oh its a terrible place to go because its small its humid it just physically drains you because the minute you go outside you perspire you know its fatiguing but these vietnamese refugees were in tents they were served army food chow lines they slept in cots there were mosquitoes all around you perspire and you had to wear clothes that are drenched with sweat and here were a group of people who had just lost their families some of them lost their country totally they would never ever be able to go back in their lifetime and they were facing a very uncertain future they didnt know where they were going to go what kind of people they were going to meet many of them didnt even speak english and yet there was this sense of hope that you could feel throughout the whole camp yes people were down and some of them were crying but more importantly they were talking about the future and the hopes and dreams that they had it was very touching and i was quite impressed i said to myself boy if any group of people are going to make it in the united states its going to be this group i didnt know anything about the vietnamese culture but what a resilient group of people they support each other the families seem to be very very close and its perhaps their faith not only in their own deity but in god because many of them were catholics others obviously had their own native religion to which they went to seek support in times of need but they were just marvelous individuals just marvelous and i had a great deal of respect just watching them for several days as i was doing these stories moorhus did you travel with a camera person tanabe yes moorhus and any other crew members tanabe no it was just the two of us this is local tv we dont go with sound and audio people it was just the two of us the photographer and me and i was like a producer reporter researcher i did everything secretary coffee gogetter or whatever and the photographer was the driver light sound scavenger so we did everything moorhus what about an interpreter tanabe we found one at the camp and then it turns out that the family that we were interviewing spoke english already a catholic family and im sorry i dont remember the name and i havent kept track of this family but they eventually came to hawaii went to school and im sure they did quite well many of them came through hawaii and moved to the mainland but you do see vietnamese populations all over the place some of them are doing very well some of course still have not been able to make it but thats true of any refugee group i think it would be unfair to characterize a whole culture based on the experience of just one or two or three families but on the whole i was just really impressed that having gone through a war and seen the brutality of a war they as a group were able to pull together page  page  i think it was a real lesson for me on humanity we humans are survivors regardless of where we have our roots or regardless of what sex we are we are survivors and that was a very good illustration for me moorhus to do that story you emphasized as a local station you didnt have the kind of supports around you did you have to really fight to get to do that story or was that something that the news director approved rather easily tanabe it was something that caused a lot of concern but i was able to convince them it was well worth it i cant remember how i did the argument at the time but i was able to convince them and part of the reason is because i was also able to talk an airline into flying us down without any payment or fees in return for them being identified now this is normally not done in journalism but in this particular case that was the only way to get down and i felt that since they were not an integral part of the story itself but were the means of getting us there that it didnt really compromise the story moorhus was this an american carrier tanabe yes it was pan american at the time moorhus you said that they provided� tanabe the transportation moorhus for the two of you tanabe yes moorhus how long were you there tanabe about three days not very long moorhus what kind of a reaction did the story get here in hawaii tanabe pretty positive again remember that we were still the numberthree station and so the audience isnt very wide but what it does is it causes people to think that heres a tv station thats really doing something different very progressive looking beyond hawaii and so it was more important for the reputation that at least we attempted it and some people saw it and they talked about it more important than getting overnight ratings that were huge moorhus do you suppose that was one of the arguments you used that this would put you� tanabe im sure i did laughter moorhus it sounds like a pretty good case you were able to make tanabe yes yes moorhus the next trip that you talked about was to japan in the early seventies you said you did some work with the military issues page  page  tanabe in the seventies the military community was quite significant here moorhus american military tanabe american military it still is we have pearl harbor we have kaneohe marine corps air station which is the base for a light brigade we have the army schofield barracks and we have air force hickam so everything is here and we are the command post for�its called cincpac commanderinchief pacific fleet so all the top military brass are stationed here out of hawaii there is a huge military community i cant remember the exact number but its well past  so its a large community they are also an audience and so we need to be able to cover issues that affect them i cant remember exactly what led to this but we have briefings that the military does for journalists here so that we understand some of the things that they are doing�the military exercises the efforts that they make to maintain relationships with the defense forces of various countries and things like that i remember i went to a briefing and they were talking about some of the concerns that military families had in japan because of the huge discrepancy in the yen and the dollar at one point it was  yen to the dollar and military individuals were able to have a decent standard of living but what happened was then the yen strengthened and the dollar was at   and its a tremendous drop in your buying power if youre stationed over there that was one of many things that happened to be occurring so i remember going to japan to do a series of stories on military families how they were doing how they were making ends meet how some of them were working with the local community to not only learn about their host culture but also to share some of the experiences of being an american which is very important when you are a military outpost in a foreign country i also did a story of an unusual orphanage in osaka that is supported totally by an army troop in hawaii and this dates back to world war ii when there were many many orphans in japan one of the soldiers found an orphanage that was run by nuns roman catholic nuns and they were frantic for food and clothing for these children the soldier took it upon himself to provide that for them and then pretty soon his buddies found out and pretty soon his unit found out and they made it their thing to go to the orphanage all the time to make sure the kids had food and shelter and companionship and support and then when they were transferred back here to hawaii which was the home base in schofield barracks they continued the relationship to this day�and you know the war ended more than fifty years ago�to this day they send money over and they support the holy name orphanage in osaka so i did a story about that and found the gentleman who started this whole thing talked to the sisters every year two orphans from osaka come to hawaii for one week that they spend with the soldiers at schofield and the soldiers take them on a tour of the island and things most of the soldiers now are kids who were born after the war and they dont know what their unit had done but again its history its something that you keep alive during a time of great need they reached out and they made a difference to a bunch of kids moorhus were you particularly sensitive to the role of the military having grown up as a military child tanabe perhaps to a certain extent i hadnt thought about that but yes perhaps i wasnt antiwar antimilitary as a lot of the sixties kids were because they were doing their job they had to do their job they were under orders and they were out there in a combat zone page  page  and you dont go around questioning your commanderinchief when an order is given you took an oath when you joined and you were there to support your country although i didnt always agree and still dont with a lot of american policies dealing with foreign issues i think its important that when you are in a position such as us soldiers and the us military that you do your best to support your commanderinchief now when you come back here to the united states you can do all you want i think and should to question the way the policy is arrived at and implemented and thats what democracy is all about its a free exchange of ideas and the ability to be able to criticize when you as an expert know that it may not have the proper consequences and so i think it was important that we support the military and ive always felt that way and still do but im also the first to speak out when i feel that there are things that need a second look anyway that was my japan trip moorhus but it does also raise the way you functioned as a journalist here in terms of being connected with the local institutions including the american military you established your own relationships here and out of that came stories tanabe yes and thats the way it should be we always look at relationships and you try to offer a perspective to the local community that they may not have yet but is very important in any kind of a community where there is military theres normally friction between the local community and the military i think the military here does a very good job of trying to ease that tension and i think we as journalists should be looking at those efforts that are being made instead of just harping on criticism its one thing to criticize its another to try to understand that criticism i think journalists need to do a little bit more of that instead of just covering a protest march the questions need to be asked why are they there thats perhaps a more important emphasis that needs to be provided its a little bit harder to get to as journalists we have to be very careful about balancing the sides of an argument but shoot why do we go to school and learn about professional ethics and things like that its so we can apply it not to shrink away from covering a story that might be a little too hot or might be a little too difficult thats what were there for moorhus you went to china in  tanabe yes and that one occurred because again hawaii does have a fairly significant chinese base and for the first time pan american inaugurated direct flights from honolulu into beijing and so they were going to have this inaugural flight and i said i want to go laughter i raised my hand up first so they said okay well there were four people on that flight it was a  moorhus four people total tanabe total laughter obviously there wasnt a great demand to go to beijing for a number of reasons one being that the infrastructure was not developed yet to accommodate foreign guests we went in as journalists and again i tried to look for stories before i went so i had studied a lot i found out that the beginnings of television were there in china and so i planned a couple of things when i got there i made contact with a chinese television agency and others to find out how they did news what the people in china read and felt and things like that when i went i knew that i was taking a big risk here because youre supposed to have a working visa as a journalist we didnt have enough time so i said we were tourists page  page  and we were kind of tourists we were just going to look around we werent going to interview a bunch of government officials but we had this camera a millimeter camera moorhus you went with a cameraman tanabe a cameraman well when youre a television crew hes kind of the more important half i remember george�we were really nervous but we said okay moorhus what was his name tanabe george cabral he is portuguese very local dark skinned photographer but very hefty big you know big so i said george i want you to dismantle your camera and well put it in different cases minimum gear no tripod anything no lights you know minimum just your camera film and thats how were going to go and then when we arrived i made no secret of the fact that we were from a local television station in hawaii our guide obviously was a government guide and it didnt bother him at all he said okay i have this schedule he met us at beijing he said ive developed this schedule of things that i think would be important for you to see were going to go see the body of mao were going to go to the museum were going to do this and were going to do that i said well can i just make some requests we came so far and weve always wanted to visit china so much can we do other things instead of viewing the body of mao you know its been on television so i said what wed like to do is wed like to go and talk to some university students id like to visit your university campus and just meet people id like to go to a local store that sells newspapers and books id like to see a bookstore id like to see some construction sites where there was building going on i was there looking for a story here on how people were thinking how they were building how they were getting ready to meet foreign visitors and what might happen so he said well yes i could do that but dont you want to see the great wall of china i said okay okay okay well go to the great wall so we did some things that he felt compelled to do as a tour guide we went to the great wall we went to the ming tombs we saw the forbidden city which was all very nice but he also bent over backwards to make sure that we got to the department store that i wanted to see and all these kinds of things i must say that the highlight was going to the university and meeting these students he just drove us there and he said well this is the university of beijing i said oh what are those people doing he said theyre iceskating there was a pond there and it was frozen and people were iceskating so i said id like to iceskate and he had to really think he said what if you get hurt what if you sue us page  page  i said i wont sue you here ill write something down so we went out there i was able to talk to a number of students who shared with me because they spoke english what they thought about the united states and what they wanted to do most of them learned their english by listening to voice of america their english was very good very very good and they were anxious to try out their english on me they said its so neat to meet americans we really want to meet more americans because it sounds like they have a fascinating culture and yes there are differences between our governments but thats government we as people are very anxious again you could feel this vitality of the country even just driving around beijing which at that time was frightening because there were very few cars and five million bicycles and the driver of the cab drives with one hand on the horn and the other on the accelerator and forget about stoplights he doesnt care whether its red or green he must have been colorblind you could just feel the vitality of the country of course i also went to a playground to talk to people with children to see what they were doing with this one child rule and get a little sense of their philosophy of childraising theyre very loving parents very loving parents i remember going to a bookstore that sold newspapers and they only had a few newspapers i said where is everything he said we only have one newspaper and its the propaganda newspaper i said oh is that how you describe your paper he said oh yeah the government puts things in there for us to read so they are well aware of these kinds of things i said can i see your comic section and so they showed me their sunday comics or something equivalent to sunday comics it has satire poking fun at government�the high prices the long queue they have to stand in for everything and i said this is great there is freedom of expression in china and they do it in their own way so these are the kinds of stories that i brought back for the people of hawaii because we have a lot of relatives there a large percentage of the people here in hawaii trace their roots to china and we have business interests there and so therefore its very important for our viewers to understand the changes that are going on very subtle but very human changes for us to see moorhus do you think that trip was easier for you as a minority or as a nonwhite i should say tanabe yes oh yes and also coming from hawaii moorhus rather than the mainland tanabe rather than the mainland because somehow hawaii theres a different word for hawaii and i cant remember exactly what the chinese word is anymore but its called page  page  land of sandalwood during the s sandalwood was exported from hawaii to china so there is a history there that the chinese are well aware of when they found out i was from hawaii it was like oh that beautiful place they look upon hawaii as a different country and so it was fine plus i found out later on that there were a lot of people that would come to me and start speaking in chinese so i asked my interpreter is it because i look chinese he said oh yes you look like mao zedongs favorite niece i was startled because i thought is she in favor is she in jail or anything he said oh no shes doing very well i said thank goodness laughter so it was helpful that i looked like them plus i could read their signs chinese characters and japanese characters have the same base so i knew when we were at the great northern lake and the place where marco polo came across the bridge and all these kinds of things i didnt feel as foreign as many people would in china i was just fascinated by their history and how everything had been preserved almost benign neglect their tremendous pride in their culture and again their humanity our interpreter was telling us when he was ten he was sent to siberia because thats the way they did it they had youth camps end tape  side a begin tape  side b tanabe certainly i knew more about china than most individuals on the mainland but i didnt know that much again these are human beings moorhus explain to me about the chinese and japanese characters i think i had known they are the same but theyre pronounced differently tanabe yes theyre pronounced differently moorhus how do you know what the meaning is is the meaning the same tanabe yes the meaning is the same moorhus even though they are said differently tanabe yes so i knew when the sign said men and women and i went in the women side laughter moorhus you took film and brought all the film back here then and created stories out of that tanabe yes a series of stories now today i cant remember exactly what they were but obviously they were on the news information i did one on chinese television i did get to their television station and interviewed a woman who was in charge of the television operation in beijing moorhus my goodness page  page  tanabe i made a point to try to watch the commercials you know commercials really say a lot about what kind of products are available consumerism whether its active or not how they sell so i was looking at these and i managed to bring some of the commercials home what you do is as a journalist you cant make academic analysis of certain things but you can be observers very good observers and you can interview people about how they feel and thats what you put together i didnt do anything on government pronouncements anybody can get government pronouncements but not everyone can get consumer reaction people reaction a sense of that and thats what i did moorhus how long were you there tanabe i was there a week i think i was four or five days in beijing and another three days in shanghai now shanghai was a totally different place from beijing beijing is the capital and the seat of government and so theres a different feel shanghai is sort of like a commercial center a very very entrepreneurial spirit everywhere you go i went into a number of stores and talked to shopkeepers there a lot more excitement in that city a lot more trade more people who seem to be dressed differently in beijing everybody looked the same in shanghai there was more color i mean those are different things that we as westerners and as journalists can pick up immediately more newspapers in shanghai and of course a history of having more contacts with westerners so it was quite interesting moorhus what kind of a reaction did this series get from both your news director and the populace that saw it tanabe it was again very similar to the vietnamese refugees one we were among the first to go to china a news crew from hawaii and come back with those types of reports i think i had more reaction from people who watched us all the time and appreciate those kinds of opportunities i also worked very closely with people here who had close contacts in china and were able to help me make those contacts for instance the uschina friendship association and so within small groups of viewers i think we had a very high standing and what it does is it reinforces their perception of what the television station does and what its responsibility is because television stations operate with fcc licenses in return for using public airways youre supposed to provide a community service youre supposed to provide information that is useful for a community to improve its quality of life among other things and thats what we were doing i take these responsibilities very very seriously and it makes it more exciting to be able to reach out and do these kinds of things moorhus you said when you did the story on guam that you were the numberthree station your ratings hadnt improved had they improved by  tanabe yes they had considerably there were a number of other reasons for it that i should let you know about we were acquired by the parent company that owned des moines register which is a very very wellknown newspaper and known for its high standard of journalism they acquired khon and one of the first things they did was put up a new tower for a transmitter so that more people could get our signal number one number two they started to pump more money into the news operation so it wasnt always a shoestring budget there was a decent budget to do more stories and we werent restricted we didnt have a film quota for instance you go out and you do your story and you do it the best you can and so there was page  page  more a sense of professional standards and requirements than there were previously under the old news director moorhus so they had brought in a new news director as well tanabe yes his name is kent baker who is still here by the way he came here on a sixmonth contract and hes still here too laughter moorhus when was it that the takeover occurred tanabe it was  somewhere around there somewhere in the midseventies moorhus did you find more support from the new administration the new owners tanabe oh yes oh yes well first of all i was more comfortable with the people the des moines register was more in the same mold of journalism and thinking and philosophy that i believed than what some of the trends were in the early seventies that was going more into entertainment and flash and things like that however i was well aware that television is primarily an entertainment medium and therefore the stories had to have some kind of visual or entertainment value i fully understand that but news is news and so you provide news within your thirtyminute news block and that was very important to me moorhus so in the late seventies the new owners took over and your budget increased did your role change in any other way tanabe by this time i had a child and so i didnt want to work as long and as many hours and i wanted a little bit more flexibility they also decided to experiment a little bit with the news team and so they did bring in another anchor to replace bj sams the old anchor and old news director there was a little bit of problems with that chemistry problems as well as differences in style and philosophy so it was a very difficult period for me what happened was i eventually went off the air and instead focused on reporting and then i only did weekend anchoring so it was a little difficult to make the transition but i think overall it reinforced my reputation as a reporter and journalist because then when i was out in the field i did a lot more aggressive reporting than other tv stations were doing at the time and so i think it really did increase my reputation as�you know i felt i was a very strong reporter that was around the era when i also broke the major news story on the rewald case moorhus and we want to get into that but since youve mentioned your son lets talk about your son nicolas tanabe nicolas is now fourteen moorhus nicolas tanabe thats right without the h because he was going to be nicole but he turned out to be nicolas laughter moorhus tell me about the pregnancy and being a mother page  page  tanabe first of all my husband and i waited eight years before we had a child i was thirty at the time he was born and the reason we waited so long is because i wanted to make sure i established myself as a journalist and as a professional because i did not intend to be a nonworking individual i felt that i worked hard to get where i was and i intended to continue and roy supported me totally in that however ive always loved children and wanted my own and so we decided it was time of course it took a while when youre older it takes a while longer to eventually have a child but i managed it and the station was quite supportive i continued to work until the day before i gave birth and that was because i was in fairly good condition i didnt blossom as much as other people do i did put on enough weight so that people knew i was pregnant and were constantly asking about it but i managed to waddle around and do my thing i was very fortunate in that my morning sickness and my pregnancy was not bad at all i was constantly happy and its because id waited so long and i knew this was the right thing to do my husband supported it the people at the office were supportive i was just totally happy for the whole nine months�never lost my temper never growled at anyone it was just a wonderful time for me moorhus you were still anchoring during this period tanabe yes and i went to lamaze class in between newscasts laughter moorhus and when was nicolas born tanabe june seventh i worked june sixth got off work and went home about eleven and then about four i started to get these sharp pains but it was just back pains and the doctor said you better go in barbara but it might be a while the whole labor was seventeen hours but the first fourteen was just kind of little pains i mean all women are different right so i walked around and it was only the last three when it got uncomfortable but even then it wasnt that bad and the transition period which is supposed to be the toughest part that lasted all of two minutes for me the doctor i remember came and looked at me and said ah barbara its going to be a while im going to go and have dinner i said okay doctor see you later well thirty minutes later i got rushed into delivery the doctor didnt make it so the intern delivered the baby the doctor comes panting in and he said hi barbara i said doctor youre too late hes here laughter so it was just a very happy very good experience for me all around and then i was off work for four weeks and i went back in a month moorhus what did you do about caring for the baby tanabe nicolas became the responsibility of my husband laughter and thank goodness he had gone through three babies before so he knew what to do you know its kind of neat to see this bonding between a father and a son with his first family he was always too busy and wasnt page  page  there when the babies were born and really wasnt there in the beginning and he didnt want to miss it this time so he was in charge so to speak to this day theyre still very close and they still talk to each other as nicolas was growing up roy would take him everywhere�to do marketing to the laundromat and things like that and everybody knew him because he was the man with the little baby on his shoulder and so it was really wonderful for me because my husband always felt that one parent should always be at home it was very important for a childs development for a parent to be home and in this case it was easier for him because i had a very demanding job it was sort of like a natural decision that was made�very unnatural from anyone elses perspective for the mother to be working and the father to be taking of the child but as long as it was a parent we felt that there shouldnt be that much of a difference whenever nicolas was ill or something it was very obvious that it was mother that he wanted babies and children react differently to mom and dad even if there is a role reversal as to who goes to work and who stays home the way a mother relates to a child and the way the father relates to a child is always very different so there were instances when i did better with nicolas and there were other instances when roy did better but we were always with nicolas he never stayed with a babysitter in all his life moorhus so you went back to work full time then right away tanabe right away moorhus but youve had the flexibility to be home when he was sick tanabe yes i did but he was never sick he was this tough little kid he never got sick so it was very nice i think in many ways because i was an older mother and roy was an older father we were pretty mellow parents and i think that kind of helps with your child the child doesnt feel this oh my god what am i going to do feeling hes very secure in knowing that we knew what we were doing and so he was a very calm baby he slept through the night at age six weeks youd put him down at  pm and hed fall asleep and then he wouldnt wake up until  am the next day moorhus my goodness tanabe he was just a very mild baby two naps a day he never cried until he was about three or four months hed yelp when his diaper was wet and things like that so he was a very easy baby i was very very fortunate never had any trauma spells looking back and comparing experiences with other parents i think i was very fortunate to have that kind of a baby with that kind of a disposition and then a husband who wanted to be the househusband i didnt have to fight again those types of battles that other women may have been stressed over i didnt have to make those choices between is it my career or is it my family i was able to keep them separate but early on i had already made my decision its my family thats the priority because theres only one person who can call me mom and only one person who is my husband ill have many jobs ill have many bosses ill have many employees and many colleagues but only one family and so my priority was very clear in my mind and because of that perhaps it was easier for me to make decisions and try to work around things moorhus was the traveling hard for you like the week in china page  page  tanabe oh the week in china i really missed nicolas moorhus he must have been about two at that point tanabe yes he was a year and a half it was funny because i took a picture of him and i shared it with my interpreter and he almost cried because he missed his baby too laughter it helped to have somebody who was understanding and to have the picture so when i went home it was just neat because he was just all excited that mom was back you know when you have a baby it changes your perspective because i was so intense on career that you forget you know career isnt everything when you come home and you see this little child who doesnt care what you are what kind of a day youve had but hes going to love you all the same you start to look at the world a little differently i think i was probably a little bit mellower in my own way in the way i approached work things werent these gigantic problems anymore they were manageable i think it did me well to become a parent at the age that i became one moorhus you said that that gave you a different perspective when the ownership of the station changed and then you found it advisable or necessary to change your role tanabe yes i think if i didnt have the family didnt have my baby i would have been crushed to have to change so much every change in a career is threatening unless its upward and more responsibility and more visibility and things but i think it caused me to reflect a little bit and i said well its not important for me to be on the air all the time i mean i could do certain things i could work around it so it wasnt as critical for me moorhus so you did perceive that going off the air full time was not a step forward tanabe oh definitely it definitely was not but it wasnt the end of the world moorhus did you ever think at that point about leaving hawaii or that job and going somewhere else tanabe oh probably so but not real seriously i was doing well at the station i know the ratings were going up i know that my recognition factor was quite high and i was very comfortable in knowing that i did a good job so in many ways the forces that would cause one to leave were not as strong for me however i think that you just start to think about the life that you have chosen and some of the problems in television news�this was after the movie network had come out and there were all kinds of criticism about the values that television news perpetuates you begin to wonder about it yourself too and figure out what your role is in this whole industry i was looking at an industry in which people were judged not on their understanding and role as journalists but on the way they looked and the way audiences perceived them those are external factors that most people cant control i cant control how people are going to look at me and first impressions or judgments they would make i can control my role as a journalist and the work   network  sidney lumet film starring faye dunaway peter finch william holden and robert duvall  page  page  that i do the reporting that i do and the standards i follow and everything about being accurate and truthful etc having great contacts so you can follow up on stories and come up with ideas i can control all of that but thats not what the ratings judged you on the ratings judged you only on how the audience perceived you you wonder its really not fair you know its really not a way to run a good business when your primary assets are your people and how good they are as journalists and yet youre judging them and compensating them according to a ratings system which is flawed by virtue of depending on human reaction so that bothered me a lot i remember being told by a friend of mine but barbara thats the business that you chose you have to make peace with it i sat there and said well i dont know if i have to make peace with it its not right and so its at that point that i started thinking maybe i do need to look at other careers and so i became very deliberate in looking at the landscape what is happening in this community moorhus this was in the early eighties tanabe this was in the early eighties what is happening in hawaii and the news business and how can i increase my value to the station not just as an anchor because anchors they can come and go really when you think about it reporters can come and go too but what makes you valuable are the contacts that you have the ability to be able to follow up on stories to break new stories and do innovative things that cause people to listen and also have good judgment i looked around and i decided well there was no one really covering business as well as they should and this was a time of recession there were a lot of big business issues but nobody at the station felt comfortable following through on it because nobody had a background in it so i said okay heres a chance for me to start doing something better but in order to develop more credibility in this area i needed to improve my network and contacts thats when i made the decision to go back to school and get my mba there was an executive mba program at the time which is all day friday all day saturday every other week and you compress your education into two years on weekends so i enrolled in that the station was very supportive they paid for my tuition with the understanding that i wasnt really going to take that much time off friday was my day off and i think saturday i had to work because saturday and sunday i was anchoring so i arranged it so that on saturday id leave class thirty minutes early to run to the station in time for the five oclock news and i did the news and then i stayed until midnight so saturday was kind of a long day for me moorhus when did you begin the program tanabe in  so after i got back from china i nearly died donita and i would not do that again but you know when youre younger you dont know any better right moorhus and you had a baby tanabe i had a baby moorhus a fulltime job and graduate school page  page  tanabe and graduate school it was tough im not one to get bs and be satisfied with it and i was getting bs in accounting i remember sitting in class not knowing what the professor was saying and ive never been in a situation like that so i had to study doubly hard i took very meticulous notes but anytime i didnt understand it i would underline it and id follow up with the professor these professors�im sure i got my moneys worth out of them id go visit them on weekends or on off days and id say look reggie this is what you talked about in class and this is what i dont understand and i would start out with like two pages of questions on his course he would answer them and it would take two hours for him to review this with me id do that every single weekend the last time that i talked to him my notes were down to two paragraphs instead of two pages and i got an a out of that course but thats just to tell you how hard i had to apply myself in areas that i really didnt have a comfort level but i was able to finish with honors after i finished i did a number of business stories and people were very comfortable having me do these when i went to interview business executives in town they were very comfortable because they knew i understood and spoke their language and i would ask certain questions that were not off the wall but were thought out i had reviewed their annual reports and knew what their latest earnings statement said i had done all of that and so i had very very good contacts within the business sector i graduated in  it was a twoyear program i continued with the tv station and they kept saying are you going to leave us i said i did this so i could improve the kinds of stories that i do with the station and i really did not want to leave although i had questions about the way the company was managed eventually i hoped to be able to move into management and help out with some of the things as far as evaluating their people and structuring it in a way that would be more responsive to encourage better reporting moorhus i think right in here is where the ron rewald story fits in because that was  now start at the beginning and then describe the story and all of the consequences tanabe the rewald story was interesting because now that i was the business reporter id get all these kinds of things crossing my desk there was this study that had been done by this company headed by mr rewald in which they analyzed the flight of capital from hong kong into hawaii since hong kong was to revert in  to china there was a lot of capital coming out of hong kong and being invested in hawaii i read this study and i thought it was very poorly done there was no primary research the analysis was very poor the conclusions reached were really questionable i said people paid money for this this is ridiculous so i thought id better follow up moorhus who paid the money to have the study done tanabe i have no idea but whoever did pay for it did not get his moneys worth was my feeling i heard somebody on radio trying to promote this and i said this is really weird here is a company that has an unusual name moorhus what was the name of the company page  page  tanabe it was bishop baldwin dillingham wong  rewald its a very long name which included the most illustrious names of families in hawaii�bishop baldwin dillingham those are very illustrious names in hawaii and then there was wong and rewald thrown in i decided to follow up on this story and i was getting not really good information and so through my contacts i found out that the state department of commerce and consumer affairs may be investigating this company i knew the director and the director kept commenting barbara i cant talk about anything that were doing heres a section in the law that says if we investigate anyone its supposed to be highly confidential i said mary im just asking you to go on record and say yes or no she said i cant comment well you know what that says to a reporter theres something going on here so that was enough for me to go do the story mr rewald knew about my reputation and did not want to meet with me which is the second red flag that goes up but i did meet with his associate and i went in there and i said i just want to ask you about the company oh yeah great we want all kinds of publicity so we went in there and started to talk and finally i said did you get a subpoena from the state there was this gasp and i knew right away he got a subpoena so i continued the questioning what is the question that the state is asking you what kinds of things are you providing all those kinds of things thats all it was as a journalist i still dont have a story to hang on other than i do have now confirmation that the state is doing something because the company gave it to me he said how did you know about that it just got here yesterday you know it was that kind of a thing it didnt even make the top of the news it was the top of the second section about how the state is investigating a local investment company that was on friday on saturday i was anchoring the news five minutes to ten before i go on to do the late news i get a call from george cabral the photographer he said barbara do you know a ron rewald i said yes i just did a story on him ive never met him he said barbara theres something real bad going on he tried to commit suicide and hes mumbling your name this is five minutes before air time i said george are you sure about this he said well yes i was down at the sheraton where the suicide occurred moorhus the sheraton hotel page  page  tanabe yes he apparently was writing some names down he had your name written down and as he was taken away by ambulance the security guards told me that he was saying barbara tanabe ruined my life i said where is he george he said queens hospital i called just to verify i said did you receive a patient by the name of ron rewald and is it a suicide attempt and they verified it so i wrote a quick story for saturdays show saying that the head of this investment company had attempted suicide following reports of� pause moorhus an investigation tanabe and thats all it was and i was just shaking like a leaf because at this time i didnt know what was wrong i did know that somebody tried to commit suicide because of a story that i had written and now youre just praying that everything is accurate that youve done everything that youve followed through and from that day on for the next four months i didnt take a single day off i was consumed by this story the way it unfolded was that not only was the state investigating but there were others that had questioned it all along but didnt know how to approach this company the courts found it was a pyramid it was a scam he would take money from investors and then use that money for himself he had this huge home sent his kids to school in a chauffeured limousine it was awful and the people he scammed included wellknown people as well as widows who gave their lifes fortune to rewald to invest and with promises of heavy returns moorhus these were local hawaiians tanabe these were local hawaiians he bilked people out of hundreds of millions of dollars i cant remember what the amount is anymore but one thing led to another and then all of a sudden we were the ones that broke the story we were several days ahead of anyone else i met a friend of mine who worked for the honolulu star bulletin who said barbara ive been working on this case for months and i couldnt do any story until i had the hook you guys blew it because you got the hook so you got the scoop but they were right behind me as far as following up on certain leads the company was forced into bankruptcy the depositors filed suit they were all trying to get information everybody in town was on this story it was on the front page for weeks and weeks and weeks and i was always named in it because of the suicide moorhus because he had used your name tanabe and he had used my name anyway it was a twoperson effort i was the reporter that did the initial interview and there was another fellow at the news station richard borreca who worked with me and between the two of us we tagged teamed we were very careful in the way we handled information we called our attorneys immediately to make sure that they had our records we did nothing illegal we were not wiretapping anyone we werent going in there misrepresenting ourselves at all we were doing everything by the book but we didnt know what kinds of accusations were going to be coming page  page  to us so thats why we very early on called the attorney to make sure that he had possession of all of our notes moorhus this is the attorney for the station tanabe yes for the station and then i took extreme precaution with my own family too it was just a time to be extra careful as it turns out rewald tried to use as his defense that he was a cia operation and he was a cia agent and was working under orders from the government among other things when all of this started to come out then the networks became involved the wall street journal became involved the journal did a huge story on the front page about this operation all three networks did something to a certain extent when they got involved they gave legitimacy to rewalds claim but in the end he was convicted and sentenced to prison he has to serve a minimum of eighty years he got a year sentence for all the counts of fraud toward the end when the courts took over and it became a legal issue then i started to back away and other reporters came in because it became a fairly routine job but i remember going to federal court and this was a hot case i mean the courtroom was packed and so i peeked in i thought theres nowhere to sit and i was going to back out well the judge saw me judge fong he said oh barbara come on in he said theres a chair right here why dont you come up here and sit down well it was a chair right in front next to rewald i went in there and made myself as small as possible and just took notes i found out later that rewald filed a suit to set aside the sentence based on harassment because the judge made him sit next to me for him it became a very personal battle with a reporter but again i look back and i did not do anything that any good journalist would not have done to pursue a story make sure that only the facts were stated and so even though he threatened us with a lawsuit there was never any lawsuit against me or the station we did everything correctly its interesting because i have a black folder over there after i quit news and i came over here this lady showed up one day and said barbara this is a clipping of all the rewald stories that i kept because it was such a fascinating story and it occurred to me that you may want it for your own she just gave it to me i dont really want it but its still there there are a number of stories on that case it was really one of the biggest stories that shook the town moorhus if i understand correctly you didnt suspect the story that ultimately came out thats not what you were investigating tanabe no i did not no i was just trying to find out what the subpoena was for whats going on here what does this company do moorhus and your curiosity was aroused initially because the analysis of the flow of capital from hong kong� tanabe was very poor and thats all it was can you imagine that here is a recent graduate with an mba reading this thing and saying this is really worthless stuff and thats how it started page  page  moorhus and you kind of backed or fell into something that was huge tanabe thats right huge huge thats what it was moorhus thats amazing tanabe it is moorhus but it obviously became very personal he attacked you very personally tanabe oh yes very personally then it causes you to question what you have done and i did i looked very closely at everything that i had done and i said but i didnt do anything wrong everything was right and im going to continue this so i didnt give up i was a little bulldog as far as digging into the story until the fbi took over and the courts took over and it became a legal issue even the fbi called me on occasion and wanted to know what i knew and i said look im not your investigator ill give you information thats a matter of public record and that you yourself can find out phone numbers of some of his contacts in minnesota and things like that but everything else you guys can do yourself i wasnt going to be helping them out but i was very courteous about everything and they understood im a professional journalist im not a researcher for them moorhus and the station supported you throughout this tanabe yes they did they did they were very good about that i remember the story broke in august i didnt take any time off during that christmas holiday it was easter before i finally got a day off because i worked saturday and sunday my normal anchor days and then during the week every single day i was on the rewald case its a good thing i have stamina moorhus stamina and a supportive husband tanabe yes thats very major that was very major moorhus did this reporting coverage win you awards tanabe no moorhus nothing tanabe no in all the years that i was a journalist i never submitted any of my stories for awards the emmy that came out of seattle was because the station submitted it i didnt even know i was nominated until we won it but khon wasnt into submitting anything at the time during the time i was there later on they started to submit documentaries and things but no this may sound a little selfserving but i really wasnt a reporter to get awards youre just a reporter to do what you feel is a good job i didnt need awards to reinforce that i knew that what i was doing was okay and so it wasnt that important for me moorhus but the station could see that it certainly had done them well page  page  tanabe oh yes we were the ones that were on top of the story we were the ones moorhus that must have been a very draining draining period for you tanabe yes it was and it was also the time when a friend of mine who ran this company called and said maybe theres something more that you could do and i started to think seriously about moving on into a different field i felt that id done everything that i really wanted to do as a reporter and in order to be a real member of the community you have to do more than just look at problems and be objective of the whole thing you have to be able to come up with solutions and then work at those solutions i was in my late thirties and i was well known in the community and i felt that i wanted to do more as a journalist its very difficult to get too involved in actual solutions because then you do take a position and you advocate a certain position and so i felt that perhaps i needed to rethink my role moorhus but before you left you did a major documentary tanabe i did moorhus so even though by the spring of  you were beginning to think there may be other options you certainly didnt give up your involvement tanabe i didnt give up at all the big thing coming up obviously was the ferdinand marcoscorazon aquino battle we have a very large filipino base here and theyre basically ilocano which is marcos home town this is a very big marcos community moorhus what was the� tanabe ilocano its ilocano that is a region of the philippines which is ferdinand marcos hometown hed come through here many times and always had a rousing reception from the people anyway i felt that he was being seriously challenged there was a real threat to his power base because of what had happened to benigno aquino�he was assassinated�and it would be a very good time to do a story on him i managed to convince the station to send me over to manila at the height of the campaign between aquino and marcos again i followed the same method that i normally do i made contact with the filipino community here on both sides of the issue the ilocanos versus the antimarcos group and i had   in the  election ferdinand marcos ran against corazon aquino for the philippine presidency former philippine senator benigno s aquino jr was shot dead on august   the day he returned to manila from exile corazon c cory aquino widow of benigno aquino assumed presidency of the philippines february   after winning the election against ferdinand marcos page  page  credibility with both i got names of people set up interviews and then i went over there to do a story i remember the first day i got a phone call from the news director saying okay barbara so whos going to win marcos or aquino i said its going to be aquino and he nearly dropped the phone he said wait a minute everyone knows its going to be marcos i said no its not because i had seen the marcos campaign i had seen the aquino campaign and there was a difference in the commitment and the intensity of the people at these rallies the aquino people were really committed you could see it in their eyes there was a sense of mission they were dead serious the marcos campaign had many freeloaders they were there milling around they werent really interested in what was being discussed they were there to get food money it was very obvious i was a foreign reporter and there was intimidation of the foreign journalists everywhere we went im not used to this at all youd walk into your hotel and youd have to go with your arms up because there were armed guards and theyd frisk you at the hallways on every floor there was an armed guard with bullets and a machine gun all over youd see evidence of� end tape  side b begin tape  side a moorhus you were talking about the aquino campaign tanabe yes and how i was convinced that she was going to win if we went by the kinds of commitment given to the campaign but it was also you must understand the philippines are very violent where life is really not valued as much as we ourselves would before i went obviously i was going to cover the marcosaquino campaign but it was also necessary to cover some of the conditions of the country itself how the people felt how they were doing what some of those with interests from hawaii were�for instance the del monte operation which is substantial what were they doing and there were lots of things that i did i was there for over a week and traveled throughout i followed ferdinand marcos when he gave a very big rally in a little province called pangasinan which was north of manila where many people from hawaii came i also went to negros where there was major insurgency problems and there were alleged violations of human rights because insurgents were beaten and things like that i went to the bacolod jail and interviewed those insurgents i also went to cebu where mrs imelda marcos held a rally to cover that rally and also visit with the cardinal there who was against marcos and he explained to us why i went down to the southernmost island mindanao where there was tremendous upheaval with the insurgency and del monte had a major operation so we flew down there in a private airplane as we were guarded by bodyguards we did a number of stories and toured their plantations moorhus bodyguards provided by del monte tanabe oh yes provided by del monte during the whole time i was there i was really on edge in fact before i went i got extra life insurance�isnt that awful�because i was so worried but i felt it was an important story to do and i never told the photographer this norris was my photographer page  page  moorhus norris tanabe norris tanigawa was the photographer everywhere we went the first thing i always did was figure out a route of escape and a route of protection so i always looked for walls and trees and things behind which we could duck if anything should happen i always planned it this way before we went anywhere because i was so afraid of things that might occur to us on the plane coming home i finally told norris what i had been doing all along and he said well barbara i was doing the same thing and i didnt want to frighten you it was really funny we were both exhausted by the time we left because we were on edge all the time its a fascinating country and its a different people and you cant feel it until you actually go there and experience it go into these crowds hear what people are saying listen to them and then walk the streets one of the most touching things�in addition to doing the marcosaquino campaign i went to a very poor part of manila which is not that far away from malacanang palace where imelda marcos served caviar all the time to her guests it was a dump yard the city dump in this area where generations of families lived because they couldnt make a living doing anything else they would sift through the garbage find salvageable materials which they would sell for cents so they could buy food there was a christian group based out of hawaii that was doing what it could to provide medical assistance to these kids youd see these kids and you knew that they werent going to live beyond their teenage years you look in their eyes and theyre�its hard to describe but i saw that same look in the eyes of a child in cebu very dull theres no life in their eyes its as if they know theyre going to die i was really affected when i was in cebu there was a family that lived on a boat a mother and father and a baby and the father dove for coins that tourists on a pier threw at them for enjoyment just to watch him dive he would get the coins so that he could buy food for the family the little baby was totally listless and you could see the eyes were�i mean im sure the child was barely alive i was so angry at these tourists and i told norris make them stop its not right that they force the family into this indignant way of life he said barbara were in a different country theres a different value placed on life you cant tell them what to do and you know hes right in a third world country people die people are born and people die whatever age and thats the way it is it just seemed to me very unfair for those who are just so incapable of helping themselves so i made sure that i did a lot of stories on the work of�this christian group was called youth with a mission i found out the following year one year later after aquino had won the mission director said barbara im so glad you did this story because after you did we got so many contributions and so many people were interested in what we do and we got so much support thats the kind of thing that we as journalists can do when there is a need we can put a spotlight on it and show how groups of people are really trying to make a difference in areas where its so easy to just look the other way and say we cant do anything we can in some small way anyway that really opened my eyes a lot to another world perhaps that we arent used to and the value of a human life it really upset me for a long long time after i saw that i did a number of stories in the philippines and i remember at the very end the news director said so barbara what do you think about the future of the philippines i had to admit i was very�its a very sad case here is a group of people who are kind and openhearted page  page  and so full of life and the country is rich in natural resources the soil is fertile they have copper they have tin they have wonderful growing seasons and yet its not working because of a government thats either corrupt or inefficient and theyre unable to use foreign aid well its just a sad case but i have a lot of hope for the philippines because as a group theyre very literate they are englishspeaking so to attract foreign investment they can provide the language comfort level its like theyve been orphans for a long time theyve never had a mother and father who has been willing to take care of them and theyve been whipped around by first the spanish who colonized them and then the americans after the spanishamerican war and the japanese who came in with the occupation in world war ii theyve been victimized and perhaps their pride as a nation had been wounded what i saw most in aquino was a hope that she would restore the national pride and give them back what had been lost over many many years its unfortunate that she wasnt able to fulfill that mandate but unless journalists travel to these places and write about them and send back pictures and things its not a message that gets out very well i remember i was talking to some officials in the aquino government and they told me if it werent for you foreign journalists we would be nowhere because youre the ones that made people aware of what were trying to do and also make the other filipino people aware of it because the media was so controlled by whoever is in power that the stories that are written are totally inaccurate but for anybody in mindanao or ilocano or wherever if they have access to foreign newspapers they can see whats going on because foreign journalists are the ones that came and broke the story it gives you hope as a journalist that you go beyond national borders that your concerns are very wide and theres a common denominator in what youre trying to do among all journalists and i was very proud that we could be a part of that norris bought me this teeshirt that was being sold in manila it said im another meddling foreign journalist laughter i still have that teeshirt but thank god for meddling foreign journalists to a certain extent moorhus so you did that story as you had done others in terms of going over there filming a lot of things and then coming back and creating a series of stories that you broadcast over here tanabe yes moorhus what kind of reaction did you get from the community over here tanabe it was extremely interesting i knew that this was ilocano country rather than visayan the visayans tend to be much more antimarcos the ilocanos here predominate and there were angry words from the ilocanos who felt that i had treated president marcos unfairly but my feeling was that i didnt treat president marcos unfairly i went there and i did stories on the conditions of the economy the consul general called me and said but barbara you focused on the negatives too much i said but you know raul its true these things are happening and have been happening for generations and the government has done nothing to help with these types of situations look at the country today its bankrupt what happened to the  million in foreign aid where did it go im sorry i dont agree with your assessment that this is an unfair series of stories we did try to do an interview with ferdinand marcos and he was too busy with other matters but when i was in cebu and we took pictures of imelda marcos she drew thousands of page  page  people around her the only reason she drew thousands of people around her was she was giving away pesos and we got it on film and he said that was unfair i said no its not unfair thats what happened and we saw it people are there because one peso for them is going to be more than theyre ever going to make in a week and thats what she was doing i think that election had a lot of foreign interest we were there before nbc came and even established a bureau office so we helped them establish their team and i gave them a lot of video that we shot we were in pangasinan covering a marcos campaign unfortunately i had food poisoning i was very dehydrated so i had to leave early before marcos had finished his speech i knew something was wrong with him because he was carried on stage then when he was standing there he had an aide holding him up i understand after he did the speech and he went backstage he collapsed the network was frantic trying to get some video i said look we have video of him being carried on stage we have video of him on stage we provided it for the network and they were the only station to have him in action in pangasinan because we happened to be there it was a mile drive by car and i was so sick i had a pillow in the back seat and i was just laying down coming and going i think it must have been the water or something in the food really sick but we were able as journalists to be very competitive with everyone moorhus was khon an nbc affiliate tanabe yes it still is moorhus had it been from the very beginning tanabe yes and komo was an abc affiliate when we were in manila during that whole time i was in touch with a fellow who had been sent by nbc to start up the bureau office there and everywhere we went i came back and i gave him video footage that we had inside the bacolod prison in negros for instance we were the only ones that got in i remember he said how did you do that barbara i said well i just went up there and knocked on the prison gate and i said id like to talk to the warden please and they let me in then the warden said yes what can i do for you i said i understand that you have some communist insurgents here seven of them can i talk to them please he said sure and he brought them out laughter so i said its just a matter of going there and asking and its because i was probably nonwhite and nonmale i didnt look like i was going to do anything major i just wanted to ask some questions so i got the interview and the same with the cardinal i had a letter from a member of his congregation here in hawaii that was a letter of introduction but i couldnt get through on the telephone so i finally page  page  went down to the basilica and banged on the door somebody answered and i said is the cardinal here i would like to speak to him please im from hawaii they said oh yes hes in the kitchen having breakfast so we sat down and had breakfast with the cardinal and we did an interview it was that kind of a situation where you have to say okay im going to do it and just go you assume well the worst they can say to you is no so thats what we did moorhus you just made reference to the fact that you were at this point shooting in video rather than in film tanabe yes by this time it was video thank goodness moorhus did that make a lot of difference in your ability to produce tanabe yes we produced out in the field and we would satellite back the video footage we used the nbc satellite and wed get certain times i would satellite the footage back to hawaii and then i would do a live insert into the news the timing difference was just right it was broad daylight and we stood on the roof of the manila hotel and did the live report for the audience back home it was really neat moorhus it sounds really neat tanabe yes it just makes you work like the dickens for ten twelve hours a day i remember youre so much at the whim of your contacts we were in cebu which is about  miles south of manila several hours by plane and at midnight i got a call from the nbc bureau guy saying you better get back here real fast because the marcos people just called and the president will meet with you at  am i said nine am thats only nine hours i dont even have a flight out of here he said well try to make it back by nine okay and just go directly to the palace i find out the first flight leaves at  am and by this time im frantic trying to figure out things so we pack and get down there about three oclock to get on this flight of course i havent slept all night now and they said sorry all the flights are booked heres your standby tickets youre  and  well theres only fifty seats on the flight i said well isnt there an air force plane we could take i mean after all this is for the president laughter he said im sorry we dont have an air force flight station down here i was pretty frantic but i was very polite and i wasnt going to give this guy a bribe so i said were doing all we can were from hawaii were trying to do a story we were in cebu to do this and that ill just stand by and wait but id really appreciate it if you could get us on this flight because its very important for us to be there at nine oclock he said all right just stand over there page  page  so they started to go through numbers and he was calling twentyfive twentysix and i knew there was no way we could get on finally he looks at me so i said yes he said give me your standby numbers so i gave it to him he said you guys have the next two seats he threw the numbers away and he put us on the flight so we got there by eight oclock into the palace it was a real wild trip we sat next to some guy with chickens moorhus with chickens tanabe yes moorhus live chickens on the flight tanabe live chickens on the flight and then we got there to the palace and we had to wait around for six hours i hadnt had any sleep and im tired by this time there were other networks there at the same time obviously these were new people because they didnt know any of the staff at least i knew some of the marcos people so they kept following me around which really bothered me because i couldnt get any private conversations with these other competitors looking at me but i remember i was getting hungry because it was around noon and we were still hanging around waiting for the president and mrs marcos sent somebody over and said if you are hungry why dont you go and have some lunch in the state ballroom they had set out a buffet so we got to eat in the state ballroom and had lunch mrs marcos recognized me from cebu so when she saw me she came right to me and said arent you the team from hawaii we must have met for ten seconds in cebu and she remembered that so we had a chat and then she went and did her thing she and the president had separate offices and she would have a contingent of people coming in to see her and the president had others coming in to see him i remember when we were waiting there the american ambassador steven bosworth came in so i sat and talked to him for a while he was very uncomfortable because at this time theyre getting very close to the people power revolution and he realized that things were happening it was just a very interesting situation and a very neat time to be there to see all of this moorhus and you went back one year later then tanabe yes to do a followup on the aquino presidency and we got to tour the malacanang palace again i went to the same places that we went to earlier i visited the youth for a mission to do a followup i went down to negros to look at the sugar operations and then i started talking to people and by this time the hope had been tarnished moorhus so quickly tanabe mrs aquino had not come through and there was a sense especially within the business community that things werent getting done i did go to forbes park and talk to some of the businesspeople there page  page  and then after that story then i joined communications pacific it was not hill  knowlton at the time it was communications pacific we were acquired by hill  knowlton a year later so that was really the last big thing that i did as a journalist moorhus before we get you out of khon however i want you to talk about the song of the imin tanabe that was in  right i did that before i went to manila that was the onehundredthyear anniversary of the first contract laborers that came from japan and it was a big deal moorhus this was a documentary tanabe it was a documentary i decided to go back and follow the footsteps of the first group the first boatload of people that came from hiroshima what i did was going through old records and things i managed to find the exact place where a lot of these people came from it was a small town outside of hiroshima called jigozen today its part of hiroshima city its a small village that was incorporated into hiroshima but i was able to by digging find descendants of some of these people and do a series of interviews to get a better sense of what it was like what caused them come out and what they were looking for then i went back to hiroshima and worked with some of the hiroshima city people who helped us out i found the grave sites of some of them and old old people who remembered things it was kind of funny because every time we went through jigozen a small little village with tiny streets and id go to the market here and there and id tell them im from hawaii everybody had a relative here and they all knew about hawaii so they were more than happy to speak to us we found a little sign that said theres going to be a village celebration its the tondo celebration which is not done in many cities of japan anymore its an old tradition thats dying out thats when the whole village gets together and they have a huge bonfire to burn all the decorations for the new year its supposed to signify the messages going up to the divine being who will hear them for the rest of eternity it was a neat ceremony we went and we were treated by one of the villagers as one of their own and got to eat their traditional soup and the rice balls and things like that it was really like going back to an old era and it was wonderful what we did was we recreated things and we put together dialogues it was a different type of a documentary what i was trying to do was involve more of the current generation of people and see if they would put in the voices of their ancestors so that i could get more community involvement i worked with a group that did a lot of plays live performances japanese studio type to see if we could get more involvement some worked some didnt and so thats the documentary that was produced moorhus one of the credits is with the university of hawaii oral history project which i found quite fascinating it seems to be oral history through it but i gather that some of it is not the speakers but you used actors tanabe yes i used actors to say the words but those transcripts are actual descriptions they are actual things that occurred but in order to bring it to life instead of a reporter just reading i wanted to get actual people so thats why i tried to use actors in it to make it more of a sense of   song of the imin  produced by khon channel  news  in commemoration of the th anniversary of japanese immigration to the hawaiian islands imin means immigrants page  page  realness instead of makebelieve its just a documentary and documentaries tend to be a little boring moorhus but theres some fascinating old footage in there and old photographs of working in the sugarcane fields tanabe we went to the state archives to look for all of those and got those and then the actual footage in hiroshima we went and looked for those spots and was it cold we were in the midst of a blizzard one day but it was important for us to get that feeling moorhus what kind of a response did that get here tanabe it was very positive very very positive i heard from a lot of people especially those who traced their roots to hiroshima that didnt realize that grandma and grandpa and greatgrandma and greatgrandpa had gone through something like this it increased their appreciation for not only the old country but for what the old folks had gone through the legislature gave me a resolution for doing it which was totally unexpected but it was nice that they also recognized it its something that becomes part of history i think or a familys tradition its kind of the way i started out almost twenty years ago when i did the the fence at minidoka its important to remember you cant restore things but you can remember and make sure that if there were errors made or poor judgment or whatever it was that we dont repeat those and the best way not to repeat is to learn from it and the way to learn from it is to remember and keep those memories alive thats why i think the united states is a great country in what we do we have a lot of oral history projects we have a lot of situations where people go back and remember whether they were injustices or great events so that we become better for it japan as a nation has never done that with its history of what it did in world war ii and for that its being constantly criticized its not going to be admitted as a member of the international arena because it is unable to come to grips with what it did the atrocities that it committed against its own neighbors and until it does its never going to be on equal footing with a country such as the united states or others who are willing to face those facts and make amends thats why i really do believe what we have done in the united states in creating really a very free press upholding absolutely the first amendment rights of expression its been good for everyone not just the founding fathers and their people who may have been from europe who have been all white males but for others who believe in the rights to free expression it enriches us all and it lifts those who have been stereotyped into positions of minorities and perhaps unfairly in positions where people dont see much hope for future growth we can use avenues of free expression without resorting to violence or revolution or anarchy moorhus as a reporter did you get involved with the issues of sovereignty and the concerns of the native hawaiians here tanabe at that time not that much but thats certainly an area that we as a company are very involved in today moorhus thats a relatively recent movement isnt it page  page  tanabe it is a recent movement within the hawaiian groups and i think its very healthy we encourage our clients to help their employees address this issue and to support those who are raising this issue and creating forums for dialogue because its very important that the hawaiians be able to freely describe what they believe was an injustice and what they would like to see as restitution so that all of us can participate in creating some kind of a sovereign entity for the hawaiians themselves its not right that they were the ones that gave hawaii the meaning of hawaii and really built it and then not be a part of its future thats not right moorhus tell me how you got from khon to what was then communications pacific and is now hill  knowlton tanabe its hill  knowlton hawaii now i think in the late eighties there were a number of things occurring among which were an influx of japanese investments and japanese capital and i think hawaii was seen as more than just a tourist spot but also a place where there were opportunities for businesses whether its to make investments or participate in economic growth or for a new market for products or for hawaiian products to be marketed and sold abroad i was looking at hawaii as more than just an island and just a state and because of my background and my facility with the japanese language i felt that i could do a lot to help the japanese companies that were coming into hawaii and being somewhat criticized for their business practices and their lack of acceptance of certain forms of communication very early on i believe it was about   clif kagawa and rick zwern who were heads of this company communications pacific indicated an interest in having me join i thought about it and i wasnt ready at the time because i had too many commitments with various projects at the station the imin documentary was one the other one was the marcos campaign but i always thought about it and i had already thought in my mind that maybe it would be time for me to move out of journalism not necessarily because i dont like it or i dont love it or im not motivated by what i was doing but because it was time to be more of a participant in resolving community problems or community issues its one thing to make sure people talk about it its another to make sure that you go the next step thats the big thing about being an active member of the community that you participate it was hard for me to do that as a journalist without coming under certain situations of conflict or questions about objectivity although i think in many instances id been an advocate for more dialogue on an issue i felt i really needed to do more i needed more depth i needed to be able to use my mind a little bit more creatively because i knew i could do certain things well but now i wanted to look for solutions and help solve problems and i couldnt do that as a journalist so thats when i started to talk to my husband i never did anything without discussion with my husband because he was the other half of my life he was very hesitant about having me leave news because it had been very good to us i was very well known here in the community i had a very good reputation and going into business is something different and so we thought about it i dont make snap judgments so we thought about it for three years is what it amounts to because we started thinking and talking about it in  and it was actually  for two years before i finally did anything but i decided okay it is time for me to make the move the station by this time was number one i had done just about everything that i wanted to do it was clear i probably wouldnt be moving into management at the television station because they saw my strengths more in reporting and the visibility thing and they already had people page  page  from the mainland who were coming in and had specific ideas on how tv stations should be run so i thought okay thats something that they want to do moorhus what about the nbc network did they offer you any opportunities tanabe not really and thats because by this time there were lots of women asian women so it wasnt as if i was a rare commodity as i was back in the early seventies when they were looking for those with experience plus i really wasnt interested in going to the network from my observations of people who worked in the network in the past and the kinds of things that they did i just didnt think it would be a real secure future moorhus and that would have involved a move back to the mainland too tanabe thats right and quality of life was very important to me i remember always what dan told me about wanting his child to grow up to manhood being very confident about himself before he went to the mainland and i thought that would be important for my son we had made a decision that we wanted to stay here at least until our son was an adult and i wanted to get more involved in the community plus i didnt like being so visible because for my son i mean youd see mom on tv and mom would always get stopped in the streets and it just wasnt normal it wasnt normal to have a mother that was too visible and i didnt need it anymore before i got to the point where i would have too many doubts about continuing in television i thought it was time to make a decision so i made a decision and khon was shocked they said barbara heres a new contract it was a tremendously generous contract but i said thank you mike i really appreciate you coming back with this kind of a generous offer but its really not money im talking about its more the kinds of things that i would like to do theres a new mountain i want to climb its a new way to challenge my mind ill always think very kindly about khon but it really is time for me to move on so we had a very good amicable parting of the ways and i still keep in touch with everybody over there i think i left when things were best and thats the way to leave you want very good memories of journalism i still have very good memories of it i still believe that what i tried to do is something that was not wrong in this field i find that im still doing a lot of the basic things as far as trying to get our clients to be comfortable talking to the news media to provide information that will help reporters do a good accurate story to be responsive to the community so that there is information and perspective that they can understand when they make decisions to be in touch with government regulators political leaders all the time so that they know what private business concerns are so when they make public policy decisions its with the entire picture in hand i think its very important that we raise the level of community participation in all segments business as well as individuals as well as communities in a way i feel like im still doing the basic thing i was doing as a journalist but obviously were advocating certain positions on behalf of our clients its been an extremely rewarding and very very stimulating past seven years since ive been in private business moorhus did you come over here as president and ceo page  page  tanabe no i came over here as senior vice president i worked a lot with the japanese businesses and helped counsel them on certain types of practices in which it is important for them to communicate not only with their employees but communities moorhus can you give me some examples of that tanabe for instance when a japanese investor purchased property that he wanted to develop into a golf course and there was community opposition he couldnt understand it he couldnt understand why people wouldnt support him because it would beautify the area it would increase property values a typical japanese says this is my land and im going to do it because its legal and i dont have to tell anybody about it because this is going to be good for everyone its that kind of an attitude which to a lot of people is arrogance to the japanese its normal so it was a matter of working with the japanese investor to understand that in the united states government approval processes require community support if the community does not understand what you are trying to do they will not support it and therefore the government will find it difficult to allow permits to go ahead with that plan and so it requires more dialogue more sharing of information more discussion and meetings with the community and its that kind of thing that i work with the japanese on when the japanese investments started to dry up because they had their own problems back home i did a lot of work with american companies going into japan i would work with them on japanese business etiquette where i would take them through a fullday program where i would work with them on japanese traditions historical behavior patterns proper etiquette right down to name cards bowing how to enter a room how to seat yourself how to address people how to negotiate the body language to look for and then in dining some of the protocol for dining my mother was a very very oldstyle japanese and taught me a lot about manners because she felt it was very important when youre dealing with people today those types of manners are not normally taught to most japanese they have to go to manners school to learn the proper way to eat the proper way to use chopsticks which foods to start with all of those kinds of things i worked with a lot of americans or i should say westerners who were going into japan i worked with them here i trained australians new zealanders a lot of chinese and hong kong chinese who were unfamiliar with japanese so its almost like coming full circle im going back to my japanese roots and trying to explain some of the japanese traditions that cause people to think that the japanese are not real open well it looks that way its just that the behavior patterns are different and its easy to interpret that as a closed society when actually its more open than people think moorhus so youre kind of a cultural broker and interpreter tanabe in many ways yes and thats a role that a lot of japaneseamericans play second third fourthgeneration individuals such as myself who are very knowledgeable about japanese culture traditions language history i work very closely with the japanese foreign ministry for instance a couple of years ago when there was japanbashing at its height you remember when toshiba was accused of selling secrets to the soviets and the toshiba products were bashed on the capitol steps by some congressmen the foreign ministry called four public relations specialists from throughout the nation to go to tokyo and give them a sense of what the problem was and how we as public relations specialists saw possible solutions i was one of the four flown from hawaii chicago los angeles and washington and we had several days of discussion on that page  page  one of the key things we told them was the need for japanese companies and japanese government officials to be more accessible to the news media because when we see japan with a face theres less of a tendency to blame japan as deliberately trying to circumvent american foreign policy its always easy to dislike somebody you dont really know but if you have japanese officials japanese company executives japanese community leaders who are willing to come out and meet with the media and talk about things and try to come up with solutions its a lot better so that was a key thing that we emphasized�more meetings with reporters more meetings with community organizations and those types of things i think there currently is more of an effort being made at various levels�business academic community organizations�to do more an exchange of information with japan so although the trade war talks and words are very sharp at that narrow level everywhere else its fine theres great business relationships great academic relationships between schools great discussion between american and japanese reporters its probably a better stronger relationship than we have had at any time in the past fifty years but if you only look at the headlines it does look bad ambassador walter mondale was here a couple of weeks ago and he said yes were having a trade spat but so what we do this all the time we did it with our european partners we did it with mexico everybody we have these kinds of conflicts but its not a conflict thats going to destroy a strong relationship moorhus its interesting that this seems to fit very well with the university of washington school of communications it was not the school of journalism but the school of communications tanabe the school of communications thats right moorhus and so youve taken communications in yet another direction from the journalism tanabe yes thats how i feel moorhus do you apply some of the ethics of journalism to what you do now tanabe oh yes never lie cheat steal those types of things but if you look at the ethics of journalism the ethics of business theyre very similar its pretty basic stuff i think truth integrity those are all things that are emphasized by any reputable organization and group john hill is the founder of hill  knowlton and his big thing was integrity is it if you cannot be honest about it dont do it because its wrong its as simple as that and its something that we always try to adhere to here also although many people believe that public relations means coverup that whenever a public relations firm is called in that means theres a major coverup going on end tape  side a begin tape  side b tanabe i remember one public relations critic called me one day and said we did a survey and found out that whenever public relations people were involved on an issue especially a controversial issue the amount of news coverage went up dont you think thats bad i said i think thats great because what it shows is theres more coverage theres more discussion and people are exposed to all the perspectives of this particular issue and it leads to page  page  better decisions in the long run theres nothing wrong with public relations firms being involved if they are involved thats great i never saw the story written laughter so i feel in many instances that we do work with reporters providing information and there are other instances when we work with reporters to correct information but theres nothing wrong with that if there are inaccurate statements in print or in the public domain they should be corrected because it leads to bad decisions moorhus when did you become president here tanabe i became president last may and i became ceo in january so this is my first full year or it will be as president and ceo of this operation moorhus how does your being a woman influence your management style tanabe thats a difficult question i think my management style really is quite flexible and it depends on the situation when im dealing in a crisis situation im not real participatory ill make decisions and will move very quickly but those are decisions based on a lot of facts it has to be and its based on my experience but in normal instances my style is to involve all the group managers and get their input and together try to reach a decision now sometimes thats a little too slow for my liking but i have found that that kind of decisionmaking is the one that helps people feel a part of the company they have to have ownership of a decision or a policy otherwise its very difficult for them to feel affected or feel supportive so it is much more participatory and ive heard feedback from our managers saying that its a much more open system than theyve been used to in the past i also do share with them a lot more information as far as financial and policy issues than has been in the past and again this is because i feel that as managers they need to know how i think and so i do get them more involved i have been criticized by some who say that barbara you seem to be too handson youre always looking over my shoulder well my feeling is that im the ceo and im responsible for everything that happens so therefore i do get involved and i will be handson until the managers have a better sense of the way i make decisions when i meet with them i always want to know what their recommendations are i want to know what the facts are i want to know what their recommendations are and i want to know why theyre recommending that and then i either approve it or we have other discussions and look at other options and then together we come up with a solution but thats how i feel we need to operate in order to make sure that managers are trained properly because management is not something youre born with its not a gift that youre born with its a skill that must be developed and i find that every year i feel like im becoming a better manager because its experience it also helps that i have a teenage son moorhus which is a very humbling experience tanabe its a very humbling experience you learn to deal with various options it may not be what you want most but you dont have to make a perfect decision every time its a decision that should involve and provide as much benefit as possible to as many people as possible and thats kind of where you have to go obviously there are certain objectives that you try to reach too but those objectives have to be supported by as many people as possible so i think my style tends to border on participatory and autocratic depending on the issue page  page  moorhus youve made a couple of references as weve been talking to religious issues and to participation in religious activities and i know from one of the articles you sent that you have taught sunday school how would you describe the importance of a religious framework on your personal and professional life tanabe its very important but i wouldnt consider myself very religious and i think i need to explain that as a child when there arent too many humans you can trust you have to believe that there is a greater spirit somewhere thats watching out for you and you have to have absolute absolute belief in that otherwise theres nothing for you as a child to hang on to i just felt that there was something out there watching out for me all the time whether its the god that the christians refer to with a capital g or the spirit that the buddhists believe in or the shintos pray for as their deity its a spirit its a sense that there is a greater good that we all strive for and its common among all religions as a child i always went to sunday school and i always went to church it didnt matter which church i went to i didnt really care as long as i knew that there was something or someone listening to my needs and then i just did the best i could we were baptized as episcopalians and father nakayama to whom i referred is an episcopalian priest in seattle thats the congregation that my grandmother belonged to but when we came over here we went to a congregational church because that was the church that my friends went to and then there was another church which is a methodist church which i took nicolas to as a child because his friends were there and so again it didnt matter to me but i wanted nicolas to know that whatever happened to mom and dad that there would be a greater love for him and thats why i was very deliberate in choosing for him a private school with some kind of a religious support the first school he went to was punahou which was founded by christian missionaries but its very interesting every seventh day they have a chapel service and they start out by singing shalom and they talk about buddhism and christian and all these kinds of things but they always talk about some of the basic values that we as christians adhere to and thats very important i wanted my son to learn about it and it had to be a part of his education he now goes to a lutheran school so weve been all over but i think it is very important moorhus but basically christian tanabe its christian and the reason its christian is because the christian religion is more based on western culture which is more my attitude and my thinking ive always believed in god and ive always believed that god provides strength when youre in a time of need and when youre in a time of success that god reminds you to be humble because there are others not as fortunate who can benefit from your success and thats what you need to look at so i think in my own way ive created a process thats comfortable for me i dont go to church every day i dont go to church every week but i think about that a lot moorhus it makes a lot of sense tanabe and im not one to blame god or give him credit because i dont believe god causes storms and i dont believe god takes away a child in cebu i believe we have to work together to make situations better so those types of things dont happen but when natural calamities happen it just happens its not anyones fault we have to pick up after it moorhus so we are ultimately responsible for ourselves page  page  tanabe we are responsible for ourselves not god he gives us certain rules through various disciples and through various religious denominations and we choose to follow those rules that will help us become stronger to deal with calamities but its not him that we are to blame or to give credit i dont think moorhus i dont know whether this is a difficult or a loaded question but do you think of yourself as american japaneseamerican asianamerican do those labels mean anything to you tanabe well sure labels mean a lot because thats what people use to judge you so by definition i cant ignore them i may not like them but i cant ignore them ive always thought of myself as an american because technically that is my citizenship and so that is most accurate the hyphenated descriptions are to explain situations i think im a japaneseamerican because that explains my heritage but you know those things change all the time i probably thought of myself more as a japaneseamerican as i was growing up and as i was going to school but now i think of myself more as an asianamerican and the reason i think that way is because its too narrow to only identify myself with a small country in this world we have attributes as asians that are common among many countries its in the way that sometimes we think its in the values that we hold its in the cultural traditions that we share so that when i went to china when i went to the philippines and even when i met the vietnamese i felt a certain kinship i would not have felt that way if i had been living only in japan or living only in the united states i feel a wider identification with people who look like me who are people of color i dont identify myself as closely with black americans or hispanicamericans because i havent had that association with them i havent visited their countries or their roots perhaps i would so right now if i have to be labeled asianamerican is probably a more accurate description of how i feel now maybe twenty years down in the future i might find a different label that may fit how i feel were always growing and constantly changing and the united states is constantly changing so we shouldnt be stuck with a certain label theres only one label that im comfortable with and thats as an american and then anything else is descriptive of that particular time or that particular situation i refuse to be stuck with one label if people think im japaneseamerican well thats fine asianamerican thats fine too i know what i am moorhus so you see that the labels have evolved and certainly as a reflection of you and how you think of yourself the label has evolved but you would rather not have a hyphenated label tanabe no americans are going to look like all colors and we do right now we do theres nothing wrong with that i mean who said an american had to look like a european that may have been true  years ago but its not true today i think its great that were all different the only thing that really is not different is that we believe in the constitution we believe in certain principles that led to the founding of our country thats whats important now sure some of those are under attack because of the change in values people have but i think the founding fathers did a pretty good job considering what they were faced with to come out with certain principles the interpretation may differ now you look at the way the supreme court and the courts of the land interpret the constitution and its right that it changed now and then the laws shouldnt be rigid for hundreds of years moorhus does nicolas know japanese page  page  tanabe a little bit hes anxious to go to japan and learn more about it i havent pushed his japanese on him because i want it to become more naturally plus i had kind of an unusual childhood so its difficult for me to figure out what would be normal to describe to him he knows what i went through in that i grew up in japan and that i ate certain types of things and i observe certain holidays in a different manner and thats no big deal to him but then i think as a teenager he has started to ask questions more about japan and he wants to go the next time i go on a trip so that he could check things out himself im just really concerned about what hes going to check out laughter but its a pretty safe country and i think that hell be okay and it might be a lot of fun but i think i would like for him to learn a little bit more about the language so hes not totally at a loss moorhus but you and roy have not tried to create a bilingual household tanabe there are certain words that we use but beyond that its been quite normal i have noticed however that his japanese pronunciation is very good and its probably because hes heard us pronounce certain japanese words i took him one time for a very short time to study karate and i noticed that his rhythm was very very good hes a natural in certain things so those are things that i would like for him to continue but again i didnt push it hes into basketball and other things now i think at some point hell want to go and learn more about my tradition but the priority is for him to get through his teenage years laughter moorhus the priority for all three of you to get through his teenage years yes one last question is about your hobbies are you still doing origami tanabe yes moorhus i see only one piece of origami which looks to be a frog tanabe well yes you know what i did was ive stopped doing it as i used to do all the time for relaxation but i still do it at home i have a huge bookshelf of books that ive collected and when i go to japan i always go to origami stores and i buy paper so i have this drawer filled with paper i still teach it to my nieces and i get great enjoyment in doing that its a wonderful art and ive done it with nicolas school classes when i go to japan i visit my uncle who is a master origami folder when he retired which is about five years ago he went whole hog into this he and i have always shared origami things but now hes really into it and he does fabulous folding so every time i go he saves things for me and so together we spend hours just folding moorhus how wonderful tanabe hes a great master and some day i hope to be able to do things like he can because its a wonderful art i still enjoy reading immensely but i read a lot of novels just to get me out of this break of always reading heavy things and it helps i read popular novels just to find out what people are talking about and why movies are being made but i dont get as upset about some of these popular novels as a lot of other organizations do i basically look at it as entertainment much as television is i dont watch as much tv but i still do a lot of reading and origami and ive taken up golf i used to do tennis but my elbow went out so now i do golf and kick myself constantly but i love it because it takes you outside and its like being in a park and you can really relax page  page  so what the white ball doesnt go everywhere you want it to go but youre in a beautiful environment and so ive learned to relax a little bit better moorhus thats good and do you visit the mainland tanabe very often because my folks are in seattle so i go over there quite frequently i go to new york and visit the head office when necessary i enjoy going to the mainland every time i go it seems different and i love it that it changes moorhus thank you very much anything i didnt ask you that i should have tanabe no other than i was really floored when the washington press club foundation called and asked about it because it just never occurred to me that what i was doing was different it was hard but it was exciting and challenging and i just thoroughly enjoyed what i was doing to be able to participate in something like this is really a great honor im just so glad its being done so i thank you for this opportunity moorhus thank you

moorhus interviewer because this session was videotaped material from other sessions may be repeated here go to session one  session three index  cover  home page  note this session was also videotaped but in the first ten minutes there were technical problems with both the videotape and the audio tape recorder this transcript reflects two false starts and includes a portion of the interview not recorded on videotape begin tape  side a moorhus okay wed like to start this morning with the university of washington you arrived in seattle in  tanabe yes and youre dating me but thats all right laughter moorhus well i was already through school in  so� tanabe you dont look the part we were both ten years old when we started college moorhus thats right well why dont you discuss the university of washington you start and ill ask questions to move us from topic to topic tanabe okay well the university of washington in  was just a wonderful stimulating place with wonderful teachers students who were extremely curious and also involved remember that were talking about the sixties and this was the age of the�i guess there were many student radicals antiwar protests and there was a great deal of discussion on campus about whether us foreign policy was the right thing and a lot of questioning about the establishment keep in mind that i have just come from a very military background from a military base in which we were constantly supporting the military effort it was just a way of life we never questioned it was duty it was responsibility it was for country okay what happened tape interruption moorhus okay were going to restart the video tell me about the university of washington beginning in  tanabe okay the university of washington was a great stimulating place it had excellent teachers the students were very very involved in the community involved in the issues of the day and just to set the framework�because many people dont remember what the sixties were like�it was a time of strong feelings against the vietnam war the war was at its height there were many many protests rallies statements against government involvement this was a real shock to me as a freshman coming into the university system because i had just come from a very strict military base on okinawa it was the staging area for all of the bombing runs to vietnam and i came from an atmosphere where as military dependents we never questioned it was all duty honor dedication to country and therefore to the war effort page  page  and so it was kind of different for me to be in an environment where questioning was okay as a matter of fact it was not just questioning but actually opposing and so it was a shock for me not necessarily one that turned me off but caused me to think well gee i never thought of it this way perhaps theres merit in thinking more along those lines and so i guess in many ways i was able to start widening my perspective which i think is always what you mean to do when you leave high school at the end of high school�you know i graduated near the top of my class and i felt like i knew everything laughter teenagers are very arrogant in a way i felt like i could do anything i could conquer anything i just�i have it and then to come and be in such a competitive atmosphere where there were so many bright kids and they were thinking far ahead in terms of understanding the issues of the day i thought wow im going to have to play catchup here but it was extremely stimulating for me and i thoroughly enjoyed my four years there however i must say that i didnt have the opportunity to participate in a lot of the campus activities as many of my peers did i didnt get to go to local rallies or join in a lot of the programs or community efforts and part of that is because i had to work my way through school i arranged my school schedule so that in the morning from seven oclock to noon i took my classes and then i ran downtown and i worked from one oclock to six oclock at a reinsurance firm as a secretary in high school i had learned shorthand and typing and so thats what i did for the four years id get home at about six or seven oclock fix dinner and take care of my grandfather whom i was living with i had a very strict schedule then from eight oclock to midnight or  am i would study back in those days the university of washington was extremely competitive we had classes where i remember as a freshman there were  kids in my social science  or something like that in this huge auditorium and wed see the professor kind of this big gestures way down at the bottom it was strange by the end of the quarter there would be maybe two or three hundred of us left it was that kind of a weedingout i took a japanese language class i was in a more advanced class as a freshman because i grew up speaking the language and i still had maintained some fundamentals although i didnt know the reading and writing as well as i should and there were only sixteen of us in this advanced class and every single one of them studied it two or three hours a night memorizing characters and i had to keep up with them i couldnt be at the bottom of this class i mean it was really a matter of honor it was very competitive and i thoroughly thoroughly enjoyed it so i say it was a very stimulating experience and of course this was also the time when i was reading more newspapers to this point id been reading stars and stripes which is very controlled coming over to the united states and reading a variety of newspapers with a variety of editorial opinions was really very good for me most stimulating and then to be able to watch television news more frequently was also good i remember when i went to the university and of course you always have to declare a major i noticed that what i wanted to do which was journalism�it was actually called the school of communications and there were various sequences i had always assumed that i would go into the print journalism sequence there was the broadcast journalism sequence public affairs advertising�all in the school of communications from which chet huntley had graduated page  page  he was our star all this time id been thinking about print but why not broadcasting this was really the wave of the future end of tape  side a begin tape  side a tanabe so thats when i made the decision okay instead of going strictly into print ill go into broadcast because thats the wave of the future thats the way things are going to be happening so thats why i got into television news or broadcasting it wasnt something that i had deliberately said i would do at the age of ten at the age of ten i picked journalism as the career because i felt that this was the business i suppose that best fit what i felt needed to get done to make this a better place to live as a kid you want to make things happier make things better or easier as a child and so in my own little way i just felt that this is what i wanted to be involved in but still i wanted to also be involved in a way that was most progressive and thats why i picked broadcasting it has nothing to do with being an anchor or anything like that i never thought of myself as being an anchor or a talent i was going to be a reporter and a reporter is a reporter is a reporter is the way i felt toward the third and fourth year is when we started to get into the nittygritty of journalism where we studied ethics and actually the mechanics of journalism and some of the questions about social responsibility and things like that i was quite fortunate to have very good professors who encouraged me and saw right away that i was very quick at it in the sense that we would go through drills and it was just pretty simple for me to do because i had been doing it all along i think they were a little bit more critical as far as providing feedback and saying why did you do it this way why not this way and so i just really learned a lot of the basic skills as a journalist that people should have in journalism school it was good oldfashioned traditional journalism school and i really enjoyed that moorhus what about your fellow students how did you get along with them did you have much of a relationship with them tanabe to be quite honest i dont remember everyone and there werent that many in broadcast journalism because after all this was in the late sixties and broadcast journalism wasnt seen as a real big thing more people were in print there were maybe sixteen of us that finally graduated in the broadcast journalism sequence and they were young students like i some were vietnam veterans who had come back so they were in their midtwenties out of the sixteen of us who graduated together i was the only one that eventually found work in the field in television news because there just werent that many openings there werent that many opportunities and so many of the others went into things like public relations and advertising one other eventually broke into the field and i learned later that he became an nbc correspondent and was sent to the middle east and so he did quite well and i stayed in seattle moorhus what about the ratio of men and women tanabe there were very few women out of the sixteen perhaps there were two of us two or three very very few moorhus did that concern you at all that you were so much alone in the field that you were obviously different again tanabe no and i think part of it is because the professors were quite supportive and it was just competitive according to your ability i think at the university there wasnt that barrier between page  page  sexes that you see so prominently in business or in public after all we were all students and a lot of us were there to really have a good time and it didnt matter if you were male or female in fact it was better to have a mixed group and so it wasnt as pronounced not in the area that i was in now perhaps it was different in things like school of engineering or school of architecture but certainly in the school of communications i didnt see it as a problem at all moorhus what are some of the courses that you remember taking tanabe there were a number of great courses i thoroughly enjoyed it one was by professor george taylor called foreign policy i had to turn in a term paper and it was the impact of public opinion on foreign policy the class was on foreign policy issues and george taylor was an advisor to the administration at the time and then there was giovani costagen who was an historian a wonderful historian with shocking white hair he told lovely stories and i remember taking some courses with him there was donald treadgold modern russian history that was really a tough course im okay on history but it was tough because there were a lot of concepts that i hadnt thought about that he taught i took things like japanese literature in which we read a novelists story he commits suicide at the end so it really is stimulating youre looking at various cultures and behavior patterns and things that i had never even really thought about i took english literature and for the first time read a lot of american classics somehow i had kind of skipped over that era in high school so i didnt have a chance to delve into it and then i took things like japanese geography again that sounds pretty staid but it was just fascinating because of the ways that you look at cultural development in a geographic pattern so there were just a number of courses that i found quite stimulating there wasnt any one that really changed my mind about anything because i just looked at it as an opportunity to expand and learn in other areas interesting to note however when i first went in i guess i was selected as one of a group of students to take aptitude tests and so at the very beginning i had to do all these funny tests i had no idea what i was doing and then at the end they came back to you and said according to test results here is what you would do best in and heres what you would do poorest in and what i would do best in was russian language i had never taken russian and i had no interest in russian but according to the test if i did i would do well in it and the worst was music well i know im terrible in music im tone deaf and dont play any musical instrument but it was quite interesting i remember that thinking well you cant believe surveys laughter moorhus thats interesting were you able with your very tight schedule to establish friendships with any of your fellow students or was that limited tanabe that was quite limited i have a handful of people that i still keep in touch with one was a gal that was not into journalism at all but was quite different in fact she was into physical therapy but she was chineseamerican id never met a chineseamerican on this military base in which i grew up as a highschool student most of my classmates were caucasians from the mainland very few asians and so it was interesting for me to meet bev she had a different background her sense of family was just as strong as mine she was also very close to her grandparents and so we developed a very tight friendship and we continue to correspond regularly to this day and weve kept in touch unfortunately she left after the first year at the university of washington you know it rains up there its very dreary so she ended up transferring to california and going into physical therapy but weve always kept in touch page  page  as far as other individuals who were in journalism for some reason i really didnt establish friendships and it could be because i just didnt have time to stick around and talk to them as much as most people do and so i really didnt meet that many with whom i kept up a friendship moorhus was there ever a point during your college years that you thought about an alternative to journalism or were you unwavering in your interest in pursuing it tanabe i was pretty set but i was also quite interested in international relations because of my background i felt very much like i had a strength perhaps that others may not have in that i also knew and understood very well a different culture an asian culture and i felt i needed to use that to help bridge the differences and hardships that are imposed on individuals and families and groups of people because of misunderstandings and so i knew i would eventually get involved in something like that i remember in my last year at the university there was opportunity to take the foreign service exam and i was encouraged by several of my professors to take that and also to take the lsat test that gets you into law school moorhus the lsat tanabe the lsat because they felt that i would do very well in law school especially in international law but i said since ive been ten i wanted to be a foreign correspondent and i want to give it a chance plus at the end of four years id run out of my tuition money and i just really wanted to make enough money so that i would be able to just kind of enjoy myself youd been working hard all these years and studying and now its time to go out there and really test yourself is what i felt so i passed on the foreign service test and i also passed on lsat there were other opportunities that came up i remember there was an expo exposition at osaka an international expo and the united states was going to have a pavilion there i threw in an application to see if i could just work there during the summer as experience and because of that it led to a number of offers from within the administration because they were looking for individuals with my background language ability to do other things it was a fairly good position very good position moorhus this is the federal administration in washington tanabe yes it was the richard m nixon administration i thought about it and my father really wanted me to go into that because he felt that it was close to the center of power and there would be all kinds of opportunities for movement up but i wasnt too keen on that i just wanted to be a journalist simple as that other things i could do later on i felt and so i made some critical decisions in those years when i decided im at the fork what am i going to do i want to be a journalist and that was that i was quite fortunate in my last year of school to be able to get a job at komo as a newswriter so even before i was graduated i was already working in the field and it was because of a high recommendation from my professor when he found out there was an opening in the komotv newsroom he recommended me and i went in for an interview i do remember one of the key things in that interview was would it bother you that you were hired because youre a woman and youre a minority because remember at that time there was a great emphasis on affirmative action and especially for those holding fcc federal communications page  page  commission licenses there had to be a real effort to hire minorities and hire women and i happened to hit both qualifications i remember friends of mine saying thats insulting you shouldnt take the job if thats why youre going to be hired i said whats wrong with that its a foot in the door and besides i know i can do it i can do it and so therefore it doesnt matter what the reason is as long as i can get the job and im not going to fail at it i can do the job so i took it but obviously you feel not just responsibility for yourself but for those who will follow behind you to do a good job so youre not seen as a token i thought even though i am a woman and i am asian and there were no asian women in the field anywhere on the west coast that i knew of i knew i could do it so thats how it started out moorhus who was the professor that recommended you tanabe it was jack kinkle i kept in touch with him until just a few years ago but he highly recommended me and he had also worked at abc news and was highly respected by the broadcast professionals in the seattle area so i was quite fortunate that even before i left school i was able to start working in that field moorhus was that early in  tanabe no it was in  it was in late  so again there werent that many people at all in fact the only other woman in the newsroom was a caucasian woman who had started out as the secretary and then was doing feature reporting so i became the second woman in that news department moorhus and you were very young tanabe i was very young but you know its kind of good to be young because you dont know any better laughter you dont know that certain things cant get done you just think i can do anything and you have a lot of energy and boundless optimism so it was just good for me to do it i was graduated in march i had accelerated my program because i was starting to run out of my scholarship money and i said id better get out of school and get my job so i doubled up on my course work and so i was graduated in march and thats when i became a fullfledged reporter i joined the union got my union card and then started doing things on the air although i had started in late  it wasnt until early  that people noticed that i was on the air and of course it did make quite a stir because first of all there were absolutely no asianamerican women in broadcasting there had never been in that market and probably not on the west coast i dont recall and so it was quite unusual the station management�the management was the fisher family the station was owned by the fisher family but the managers were quite supportive of my effort and i never in any way felt that i was being used as a token as so many women during that period felt or that i was being denied certain opportunities to do meaningful work and at that time susie who was the only other female left and i cant remember what the reason was but it was something like getting married�or something like that it was not under duress or anything page  page  so i was the only one left and i remember the other men being very supportive now it could be for a number of reasons it could be that they didnt feel that i was a threat to them because i was so different or it could be that they genuinely wanted to support me i think it was a combination of many things but i never felt at all any negative pressure to keep me down or negative remarks or any sexual harassment types of remarks sure they may have called me girl occasionally but in those days it just didnt bother me i was kind of small and i still am and i was very young and they may have looked at me as a teenager struggling to do better but they always came and said barbara do you need any help or barbara do you want us to review your script well be more than happy to help you out so it was okay i did feel however that i didnt want to be always cubbyholed in doing what we called turkeys which are the fluff pieces i mean i did that for a while it was good because it got you out into the field you sharpened your interviewing skills and things like that so i didnt mind doing it but when hard news stories came up and i was passed over i marched right up to the news director and i said jack eddy you need to know that i would like to do these types of stories and im fully capable and he liked that and you needed to do that so very slowly i was able to do other things such as some political things major interviews i got to interview spiro agnew well� laughter so i was slowly getting up there i remember they sent me to the airport to cover this hijacking and i was stuck on the airport roof for twelve hours waiting for action to happen but thats the life of a reporter so it was okay the one thing that i did think about more deeply was however how minority events were covered�blacks asian community events i felt that it was totally ignored for a reason perhaps and thats because the newsroom was completely caucasian and they really had no interest in events that were occurring in minority communities i felt that i could bring sensitivity and good objective reporting to those types of issues and i really pushed to cover more of those whether it was an asian festival such as the annual obon dance or major personalities or major events that were happening in the minority community my feeling was and this was something that i had also been taught at the university of washington is that news is not necessarily what people are talking about or big events of the day but what people should be talking about its our responsibility to bring this up in a forum to increase dialogue and so ive always thought about things in a community that people might not be talking about a lot but they should be because these are important issues i remember always telling my news director as i scanned things that were happening in the newspaper and within the minority communications vehicles whether they were newsletters or newspapers or whatever bulletins that i would say heres an idea that i have jack what do you think and i was always supported it was just a great feeling moorhus while i think about it what is jacks last name tanabe jack eddy eddy he was the news director at the time that i was there   spiro t agnew b  governor of maryland  vice president of the united states  resigned on october   pleading no contest to charges of evading income taxes while governor obon  traditional seasonal festival page  page  moorhus did you report directly to him tanabe yes in fact he was the one that said barbara maybe its time for you to start doing some anchor work or talent work we had a morning news show and there were four of us who were the hosts of this morning show there was another newsperson and i was sort of his support then there was a general talk show host and then there was a woman who was an institution in seattle�katherine wise she did the cooking just a wonderful wonderful woman a former newswoman who loved cooking and then did that on television and in radio the four of us did it and thats how then i got even more visibility as an anchor moorhus how soon after you started did that� tanabe a matter of months it was just a matter of months i conducted a lot of interviews with people who came through i remember doing gloria steinem for instance and i cant remember what it was maybe it was the beginning of ms magazine or a book that she had just written she thought it was great that i was in a position such as this at my young age it was just a wonderful interview she was so supportive and then at the end after we started walking out she said barbara i want you to remember one thing i think that women sometimes take themselves too seriously and take the job too seriously you should remember to see the fun side and see the humor of things so ive always tried to keep that perspective too that everything isnt down and serious that its okay to have fun i remember doing an interview with betty friedan author of the feminine mystique  and she was just neat things didnt upset her or faze her when she got thrown these very awkward questions about bra burning and what did that do and she was very very good i interviewed a lot of actors and actresses that came through i remember rosie roosevelt grier the football player and he talked about needlepoint and how much he enjoyed that moorhus i remember hearing about his love of needlepoint tanabe yes and he was such an ordinary man in the sense that he didnt put on airs he didnt make you feel awkward so i met people that were considered celebrities who were really normal and that was nice to see and i also met people who went through a lot and were willing and able to share experiences it was just a very good experience for me moorhus so you were getting a lot of variety in this period tanabe oh yes oh yes that first year as a reporter was a great learning experience but then every year that i was a reporter�and i was one for seventeen years�i learned something new every day i learned from people that i interviewed i learned humbling experiences as well as uplifting experiences it was just wonderful but i think in that first year the first year was obviously difficult because youre still learning things and youre trying things out and people are watching you so youre doubly careful and working extra hard all those kinds of things   gloria steinem b  a founder of the womens political caucus in  a founder and editor of msmagazine  betty friedan b  us feminist writer as author of the feminine mystique  helped revive the feminist movement in the us a founder and president of national organization for women  page  page  but that first year too was when i remember going to jack and i said�and this was still in the summer and i was looking ahead at the kinds of things that i wanted to do im always like that i kind of like to project ahead december seventh i said to jack you know ive watched how the news is covered on december seventh every year and its one of going to memorials and paying homage to all the sailors and soldiers who died during that attack and its always a period when i feel a little awkward because i look japanese and i know that this is also a time when latent hostilities sometimes surface id like to be able to address that if i may with maybe a series of stories on the impact that such an attack had on the japaneseamerican community those of japanese ancestry who were american citizens and to whom a great injustice had been done he thought that was a great idea i mean thats the kind of newsperson that i worked for he said go to it barbara in fact why dont you do a halfhour documentary so i started my research remember this was before the freedom of information act i went all over the place�libraries school libraries individual regulatory agencies�and i found very little on the internment of the japaneseamericans during world war ii precious little enough to fill maybe one folder because i think many of those items were still classified so instead i went to the japaneseamerican community and i started to interview people and they were very uncomfortable because they said well you know barbara its been thirty years this is  now and weve never talked about it before youre asking us to look into a part of history that was very sad for many of us we dont know if we want to talk about it but im very stubborn so in my own way i kept after them and after them and after them and pretty soon i started to get people to open up they would look back into their old trunks and come out with photographs or letters or memories and i was able to piece together a history�not a history but events of what happened shortly after the attack and during the war years to at least the families in seattle including my own except that i didnt get that much from my father he didnt want to talk about it at all moorhus but you said your grandfather had talked to you tanabe my grandfather had a yearbook and he would tell me about things that happened during the period but not very much either i think he also was not too anxious to say much more than that but i managed to find an american minister floyd schmoe a quaker who had opposed the effort and who had continued to keep in touch with his internees his congregation the people who were interned and things like that so little by little i started to get very good interviews i was working very closely with the news director because i had never done a halfhour documentary before then he said well barbara you know you really need to go to the site of the camp   on december   japanese planes attacked united states installations in hawaii drawing the us into world war ii tv listings including the fence at minidoka came out december   the documentary aired december   later jeanne houston wrote a book farewell to manzanar which was made into a tv special page  page  i said but thats all the way in idaho he said its okay go down i managed to find a family a couple who had instead of returning to seattle stayed near the vicinity of the campsite just a little bit of background here the people in seattle washington were first taken out of their homes and taken to an assembly center in puyallup which is a small town outside of seattle assembled there until the camps further inland were built and then they were just transferred by rail to these camps this particular one where the seattle people were interned was in idaho it was in hunt idaho i always thought hunt was a town but its actually just a post office and its near twin falls moorhus who gave the camp the name minidoka tanabe im not real sure i think its written in this yearbook i just cant remember but its an indian name and i think it could have been the name of that site in indian im not real sure i remember finally getting this couple and since no one really knew exactly where the camp was but they knew they took us there a photographer and i went there and spent a couple of days walked the site and took pictures of it there was very little of the camp left other than the guard gate some barbed wire some shacks the irrigation canal which my husband roy kawaguchi used to tell me about because as a youngster he swam there grave sites it was very touching and i came back and we put the story together moorhus how many residents were there from seattle how many people had been taken out of seattle tanabe i dont have the exact figure but it was  to  it was everyone everyone was taken out moorhus during this time as you were preparing this did you try to talk to your father tanabe no he was still in okinawa moorhus did he know what you were doing tanabe i cant remember if i told him i may have mentioned it briefly in a letter but i never said anything more beyond that moorhus what about your grandfather tanabe i didnt really interview him when i look back i dont recall exactly why other than i didnt want it to be too personal so i didnt interview anyone within the immediate family i interviewed others before the documentary aired and jack said its got to air on december seventh on the thirtieth anniversary there was a preview with the local newspapers they did a writeup even before the documentary aired as a result of the preview we got a number of calls and letters angry ones to the station you know it was a renewal of some of the war hatred page  page  why are you honoring the japanese enemy why are you doing this the japanese should be sent back to japan i mean it was those types of things the whole point of doing this documentary was to show what happened to a group of american citizens who were denied the rights guaranteed under the constitution of which we are all so proud because they kind of looked like the japanese enemy there was no difference other than their face and because of that they were punished with their homes being taken away their businesses being taken away they themselves relocated four years with no idea what was going to happen to them in the future so that was what the whole thing was about and unfortunately of course many people felt still that we were the enemy i dont know if these people would ever change their mind but i was doing this documentary to bring to light an event that occurred in the past that people ought to be talking about because if people are not willing to speak up and address a problem that occurred then lessons are not learned and mistakes are repeated and so it was very important that from my perspective and i believe the station felt the same way that we air something like this so it aired and the day afterwards i remember the manager coming down his name was david crockett he came down and said barbara that was a beautiful piece im sorry that we even had commercials in it it should have just been a piece by itself for days after that we got all kinds of very angry letters bitter letters telephone calls but i also got letters of support i think the japaneseamerican community galvanized mobilized behind me because they wrote many letters of support and it was quite gratifying to get that kind of reaction but most gratifying was the reaction i got from the school board who decided to put it the film in the public libraries and within the school system so that it could be part of the curriculum because there was no school material covering this part of american history i also got calls from universities throughout the nation�princeton university numbers of schools calling to see if they could view it so that they could also use it as part of their curriculum and i remember nbc came down and we were an abc affiliate nbc heard about it and wanted to see it and there were many people that kind of realized that this had occurred and it was worthy of attention and perhaps followup after that of course the united states congress initiated a hearing they put together a commission that went throughout the nation hearing testimony from internees and that culminated ten years later with a call for reparations and apology to the japaneseamericans reparation in the form of  to each internee which was signed by the way by president george bush i didnt realize that this would start mushrooming into anything this big i was just kind of doing what i thought was an important issue im very happy that others then took up this issue and pointed out the great injustice and went forward to try to find some kind of a resolution because i think we all learned from it what i learned is that the united states is a great country to be able to recognize an error that it made and to try to respond in some positive manner moorhus did your father receive a check tanabe he did two years ago but i remember i sent him a copy of the script after i did it and i said what do you think dad page  page  and he wrote back and said good job kid he said a lot of good came out of it and you should never forget that tanabe crying excuse me moorhus thats an amazing story tanabe yes for a first year moorhus it certainly is your professor must have been bursting with pride tanabe yes hes real proud it was great i was able to do it and it was a great way to start a career im ruining my eye makeup this is terrible this happened thirty years ago youd think by now as an adult i wouldnt be so moved moorhus i dont think you have anything to be sorry about tanabe when i look back at it i think oh the script oh some of it was so bad and oh i looked awful in it you make all those kind of judgments but in the long run if it did help create greater dialogue it was worth it moorhus i think there are people who could work their whole lives and never have the kind of longterm impact that your very first significant story had really tanabe yes i didnt expect it but thats the nice thing about life there are these unexpected surprises when you do something with great commitment it could never have been done unless the japaneseamerican community had opened up if i hadnt had the support of station management and really the direction and guidance from others around me moorhus you must have had help in the writing and the editing and as you said the camera person and then the final production to get it all put together what a team effort tanabe it really was a team effort and not one of them really knew about the experience i remember the photographer his name was kurt horn a germanamerican he really didnt want to do this he said barbara this is almost unamerican what youre trying to do i said no no no lets just keep doing it it wasnt until we actually went to the site and he saw all this and he said we need to do this so it was a commitment by so many people im very happy that i was able to get it started and my name was kind of the signature on it but it really was a team effort it just taught me a lot that you need support beyond just yourself you need a commitment you need a certain tenacity to see it through and you need a hard shell to withstand the kinds of reaction that you are going to get as a child of ten i didnt think that this was what it was going to be like that i would become sort of a symbol a target but you do become that because youre on the air youre a very visible individual and many people see you in different roles some people saw me as a journalist and a very good one others saw me as an asianamerican and others saw me as page  page  that damn jap whats she doing on the air thats the nature of our society and you have to learn to deal with all of them but you know move forward moorhus from the material you sent me in addition to all of this work activity there were things going on in your personal life in  as well tanabe yes thats the year i got married moorhus thats right tell me about how you met your husband and then about your wedding and your marriage tanabe the whole time that i was going to school i was also working i started out as a secretary and then i got a call from a fellow who owned a travel agency asking me to join his travel agency i said george i dont know anything about travel he said thats okay youre smart i know youll be able to handle it moorhus how did he find you tanabe i cant remember i dont know it could have been a friend of the family or something like that he knew that i spoke japanese and he was looking for someone who could talk to his japanese customers and so i started working for him as a travel agent his brother roy was my future husband and we met while i was working at the travel agency he was an engineer with boeing when we decided to get married my parents really didnt like the idea of my getting married to him because he was divorced and had three children but i said this is my decision and im going to make it they said we dont want you to i said im sorry so we eloped this is the only thing i ever did in my entire life against the wishes of my parents and they were very upset about it i recall the relationship was strained for a while but were fine now but it took them a while to get used to the idea but sometimes you know what youre doing is right and i knew that what i was doing was right weve been married now for how many years its from  to �twentythree years we still havent done a wedding reception because i said lets wait until were sure and then twentythree years later we still havent done a wedding reception well get around to it eventually moorhus when did you elope tanabe in june of  so this was still when i was trying to get things done i was just too busy and i didnt want a wedding weddings are really for family and my family happened to still be in okinawa i just felt it was easier to just quietly get it out of the way i remember people at the office were stunned because one day i showed up and i said oh im married that was it they said shouldnt we do something for you barbara i said you can buy me some cookies or something but dont make a big fuss out of it page  page  i remember some of them took me out to dinner because they also knew roy i just didnt want to make a big deal of it it was more important for me to get my career going and get certain things done and marriage to me is a personal private matter and i didnt want it to affect my profession so i never changed my name tanabe is my maiden name i remember that was very difficult everywhere i went i had to bring my marriage certificate and my passport so that they understood that i was keeping my maiden name and my married name i didnt have one it was just he had his name and i had mine moorhus and his name is roy� tanabe kawaguchi moorhus how long had you known him before you were married tanabe oh about six months not very long which is quite unusual because im very deliberate and very careful but sometimes you know these things were kind of opposites in that hes very mellow but it was a good match and i knew right away it would be a good match hes quite a bit older than i am eighteen years but that didnt bother me it probably worked out better that way because if you have a younger partner there is a sense of competition because then he would also be establishing himself roy already had an established career he wouldnt be threatened by a woman who wanted her own career and i made it real clear to him that im going to have my own career im going to do my own thing and he thought that was great he was very supportive as a matter of fact during the time that i was in seattle�i was a reporter from  to  there�i received many many offers from all over the country from larger markets asking if i would be interested because i was kind of an unusual commodity i hate to use that word but i mean i was a nonwhite nonmale journalist and there werent that many of those around moorhus and the fcc had made it clear that more women and more minorities should be given opportunities and the networks were certainly hiring tanabe oh they were looking they were looking real hard but i didnt want to leave at the time from seattle because i felt that i was a part of the community and there was a lot that we could be doing i was working very closely with other journalists other asians and i had many students come and watch me work because now they were looking at broadcast journalism television news as a possibility for a career and they hadnt thought of it before i did many speaking engagements so i felt it was very important to keep this momentum going moorhus and roy was supportive of all of this tanabe yes he was he was very supportive i remember finally i got this offer from hawaii moorhus lets not jump to hawaii yet tanabe okay we wont jump to hawaii yet moorhus lets stick with some of the things around what was going on in seattle im really interested� page  page  end tape  side a begin tape  side b moorhus you are marrying someone that youve known a very short time that is much older without your parents permission and they must not have met him either tanabe no they hadnt met him moorhus so he was a totally unknown quantity that was a real risky thing for you to do but you apparently didnt see it as a high risk but as something that seemed quite appropriate natural tanabe i did i suppose it may be uncharacteristic its not what a daughter should be doing right but as a child i was always quite independent i kind of did what i thought my parents would want me to do and i never disobeyed but they never made huge demands on me because they kind of figured i would handle everything theyve always told me how proud they were that i got through school by myself all through my childhood i never was reprimanded that much and so it was a streak of independence but when i was living with them the independence was in support of them not necessarily opposed to them but when im on my own im on my own and i can make my own decisions so as long as it was nothing illegal and i wasnt marrying a felon you know its no big deal so hes older and he had three children i mean thats my problem not my parents problem so thats how i felt and i think they got over it eventually moorhus were there other stories that were as significant during the time you were in seattle as the documentary the fence at minidoka tanabe no i think that was the most significant i did a number of stories dealing with asianamericans black americans and in my own way i think that i raised the sensitivity in that market to the variety and richness that existed in seattle because of its people thats what makes a community and being able to acknowledge each others differences is what is most important because if you can acknowledge and understand differences its not a barrier its a source of pride moorhus did your success at komo open the doors for other women other minorities in the time that you were there tanabe oh i hope so because shortly after i left others came in immediately i think more asianamericans went into the school of communications and went through the program i hope so and i wasnt the only one in the field at the time there were other asianamericans in the print area but because i was in television it happened to be a more visible medium so in a way too much credit may have been coming my way when there were others who were doing the same thing plus i always felt that i was doing it for more than just myself and more than just people who were going to be following me i really was doing it for people like my parents and my grandparents because it was they who really paved the way and laid the foundation for our success moorhus were there ever any instances when the japanese community became critical of stories that you did that you were somehow being unfair to them tanabe that never came up page  page  moorhus did you feel that you were an advocate for the community per se or for a discussion of their issues tanabe i think i was an advocate for a discussion of their issues i was very careful not to be making editorial judgments and taking editorial positions because i felt that that was not the role of the journalist that is the role of an editorial writer and i was not that ive always felt that editorial decisions should be made after discussion after issues were raised and most of those who make editorial pronouncements whether they are writers or broadcasters are normally those who are a little bit older more mature and have more credibility within the market and so i greatly respected those who made editorial analyses but i felt i wasnt there yet my role was to bring out issues and certainly i was an advocate for that there should be many of them i think within the news department there was always discussion about what i was doing and why but i dont ever remember people saying youre wrong it was people saying i never looked at it that way or i didnt think about those types of things and thats because it was a homogeneous group it was all white male and they were talking about the same thing its important to bring in different perspectives and in that era the different perspective came from people who had different backgrounds whether it was ethnic background or different social economic level or different living experiences i lived abroad so i really was very different from anyone else plus i was a woman that also added to it moorhus would you happen to know what the percentage of the population the japanese or larger asianamerican community was in seattle at that time tanabe i think it was very small it was about  to  at the time and it was mostly japaneseamericans some chineseamericans very few in fact no vietnamese cambodians very few filipinos there was some i remember dee sibonga worked in the station at the time she later ran for city council i was very proud of that as a matter of fact in the newsroom�i forgot to mention this at the same time that i was a reporter the news director also hired a black reporter and his name was norman rice hes now the mayor of seattle but he and i took jack kinkles class together and we both went into journalism at the same time then i left and i guess he went into a different area but yes hes the mayor of seattle now moorhus you said that you did a lot of speechmaking in seattle can you tell me some of what you remember about that tanabe this is going a while back it was to japaneseamerican organizations church groups students it was that type more communitybased nothing that was business oriented not like rotary club or anything but very communitybased small groups moorhus did you enjoy that tanabe i did i felt i was able to discuss what we can be in the future we can create a vision for ourselves instead of being a victim of the past looking forward to what our children might be able to do the opportunities that existed the medium of television and how it widened the world for all of us i really firmly believed that television was a great force in society people decry the violence and some of the poor values that they saw in television but i also saw it as a strength page  page  as i said earlier to break down barriers to acknowledge differences to show a variety of voices to show human drama emotional impact those kinds of things that you may not be able to see in a written article you could feel it in television and there is a certain impact that television produced that no other mass medium could moorhus did you ever think about going back into the print journalism that you had originally thought you were going to go into tanabe no i was having too much fun laughter moorhus did you ever think about going into foreign correspondence work tanabe oh yes that was always kind of still there but i was kind of taking one step at a time and making sure that the step that i took was a firm one eventually i wanted to because i felt that the world is not an isolated world just made of one community which may have been seattle at the time but we all come from a different world or our ancestors did or our grandparents did and i felt that it helps one understand better what we are if we look back at where our values may have come from where our grandparents values may have come from so in some way i would eventually have gone to japan and done a series of stories and other places on how japan itself was changing and looked at some of the connections and the bridges from seattle to japan i think those are all very important things for a journalist to do again these might not be things that people are talking about or consider to be important for them but they should know about and should appreciate moorhus in  you were nominated as one of the outstanding young women in washington state what group is that that does the nominations tanabe at that time it was someone from the university of washington my memory is just awful right now but it was someone from the university of washington that put in the nomination for me it was just again something that i wasnt quite expecting but it was very nice moorhus you were clearly on as they say a fast track at komo and you were getting offers from other places lets come back to the offer that came to you from khontv in honolulu how did that come to do and why was that offer different tanabe that offer came to me just via a telephone call george haggar was his name he was the general manager of khon and he said hi there barbara youve never met me but my name is and i own a television station in hawaii and i want you to come work for me essentially all it was i said thank you very much and ill follow up with you a little later it was just kind of a conversation like that but i remember i was kind of intrigued by it so i talked it over with someone it was ken kashiwahara who was with abc moorhus and still is i think tanabe he still is i remember calling him and saying hi ken i got this offer from hawaii and i know youre from hawaii what do you think page  page  he said man thats going to be a real challenge that station is way behind in the ratings there are no local people on tv and im sure the reason he called is because you look local meaning i look like most of the population here in hawaii but it will be a real challenge i said how come there arent more local people on tv he said because theres no one thats ever done it whos local i said why not he said i dont know so i thought a little bit more about it and i said well this is kind of different heres a situation where the majority of this population is an asian base and yet there are no asians on television that doesnt sound right my husband was kind of intrigued by it too he said well lets just try it its only a threeyear contract we should go over there and take a look at the market we didnt have any family here it would have been quite a traumatic jump but he said lets try it so i said well okay again this is what you would consider uncharacteristic it was totally different my father didnt want me to do it he said its going backwards its a smaller market you should be going to washington or new york thats where the big bucks are i said its a small community and its a different community and there are different sets of problems i want to go see it it was a challenge so thats why i came moorhus when did you actually make the move tanabe in june of  i mean i do things in june laughter married in june and so i came over here and i remember it was really funny i came to hawaii several years before just on vacation�before i even thought about ever moving over here with my husband we came on vacation i remember the first thing i said when i came here was wow look at all these people with black hair laughter because i was used to being a minority and it was quite unusual to see a majority of people with black hair and then wed go into woolworths and say wow they sell rice here laughter it was just like wow wouldnt that be great to be a majority and so in a way i guess the seed had already been planted that gosh it was so nice to go somewhere where it was so different and maybe the comfort level would be a little bit higher for us so i decided perhaps back then subliminally that someday id like to be able to come and work here not permanently but to try it i remember after we made the decision that we would be coming here the japaneseamerican community gave me all kinds of farewell parties so every day we were going to various parties at one of them father nakayama the priest from the church that i attended said barbara thats great because ive been there many times and we have a sister relationship with one of the churches here how long are you going to be there page  page  i said oh its going to be three years father ill be right back he looked at me and said barbara you should never take that kind of an attitude when you go somewhere you should go with the feeling that you are going to stay there for the rest of your life i thought about that and i said you know hes right if you go and think of it only as a temporary sojourn you dont give your whole commitment to that community and its not right so when i came although it was a threeyear contract i was taking father nakayamas advice to heart and saying im going to be here for the rest of my life and im going to do my best here moorhus very interesting advice tanabe yes it was i never thought of it that way and you know how network journalists are we kind of bounce around all the time as a child i had bounced around a lot and i really wanted roots thats why i really enjoyed seattle so much because it was a community and i was a part of it thats where i went to school i had relatives there good friends very supportive community a great career so i came here and i said thats what i want to continue i remember coming here and looking around at the station and it was maybe onetenth the size of the komo operation komo was a very strong affiliate it was the strongest abc affiliate very successful market leader the kind of station everyone wanted to work at because it had a strong reputation and everything i was quite fortunate to be a part of komo at that time and i wanted to kind of help make khon the komo of hawaii so i came with great hopes high hopes moorhus what kind of discussions did you and your husband have about his career tanabe well he just had to leave laughter hed been at boeing by this time for twentyone years and i guess in his own way he was ready for some kind of a change i said we dont need a lot of material goods we can live on one salary we didnt need two salaries and he was also willing to let me have a try and we said someday perhaps ill have to sacrifice for your career but lets just do this just this once he said okay so we were willing to try it out and he was very supportive he said well if i dont find something right away i can always go to school i can do different kinds of things and so he was fine moorhus what did he do when you came over here then tanabe he helped his brother on the travel agency side there were lots of groups that he worked with he also went to school and took some marketing courses plus its amazing how busy he can be with keeping up the household it really is a fulltime job so he kept himself quite busy he was never bored as it turned out it was just a wonderful move for the both of us we were almost adopted by a local family and became part of their holiday tradition i very early on became very involved with various community organizations hawaii is a small community its about people who care about the environment and about our future and people here are very committed it was just wonderful to be able to be part of that kind of a community page  page  moorhus how did you get involved with the community tanabe through various organizations that i joined and through our friends for instance i very early on became very active with planned parenthood working on ways to help prevent teenage pregnancies working with teenagers i became involved with hale kipa a shelter for runaway youths and those types of things i was also involved in the same type of things that i did before�speeches with youth groups things like that moorhus what was your position when you first came to khon tanabe i was anchor and assistant news director that was the other thing that also helped i felt that it was time for me to try this anchor thing full time and see if i liked it and in a smaller community i felt that i would feel more comfortable i was offered anchor positions in other areas but i just wasnt ready to make the move i had commitments to the family and to the community and i wasnt willing to break them the time that the hawaii offer came was when my fatherinlaw had passed away my grandfather had moved in with my aunt and uncle certain obligations had been lifted and so it was kind of a good time to make the move so it was an issue of timing also if the timing had been wrong perhaps i wouldnt have come perhaps i may have ended up somewhere else but again those are the kinds of hands that life deals you and you kind of have to take it at the time so thats what i did moorhus so you came as assistant news director and anchor tanabe assistant director so it was also more of a management role that i could take which i was anxious to also do a little bit more about moorhus did you go on the air right away tanabe yes i did yes i did again i was the first asianamerican anchor in this market on a regular basis there had been anchors in the past that did it as sort of like a fillin and then you get a certain amount of notoriety because of that moorhus what kind of buildup did the station give you before you went on the air did they do advertising did they promote you tanabe yes they did moorhus did it all work were people really eager to see you tanabe i think so i wish the ratings had jumped a little higher but it didnt i think i got all kinds of comments and people were thrilled to have a local face but i also heard that as soon as i opened my mouth they knew i wasnt from here because my enunciation was too smooth however they were quite surprised because whenever i pronounced a japanese name i said it the proper way which really surprised them and i really worked very hard on the hawaiian names so that i said it properly rather than anglicize those words i worked on that right away moorhus how did you like anchoring page  page  tanabe it was okay my first love was reporting and i couldnt do as much of it anchoring is quite restrictive sometimes because you read words that are handed to you of course i would rewrite and i would write lots of things i also felt that i was stuck in a mold as far as what females�now this is where the female part came in a little bit more strongly than i would have preferred i felt like i was sort of a subpartner in that the male always took the more prominent dominating role and i absolutely refused to do the weather because i felt that i didnt want to be typecast and i really wanted to project the role of a professional woman so i think early on people felt that i was a little too stiff and formal but they always used the word professional to describe me which is what i wanted i was not into this cutesy happytalk format i was there to do a job and i was there to show that women could do a job just as credibly as men this was very important to me and it was a message that i firmly believed in and i pushed a little bit more strongly than i did in seattle moorhus did you share the anchor role then tanabe yes we did moorhus who was the coanchor tanabe bj sams billy jack was his name but he went by bj sams wonderful individual moorhus were you the first woman that hed had to share with tanabe yes moorhus so he had some adjustments to make tanabe he had some adjustments moorhus how did you negotiate your working relationship tanabe pauses with difficulty tanabe with some difficulty with some difficulty but he was a very secure individual he didnt feel that threatened and he was quite willing to share certain things and i knew better than to push on others he led and closed every newscast for instance but i wasnt always relegated to the fluff things plus i early on developed a reputation for doing onair interviews which were very strong so in my own way i think i tried to project more of a news credibility thing when i look back at it now i probably�you know hindsight is always perfect right i was probably rather arrogant perhaps in the way i approached things perhaps i was a little inflexible or intolerant when i saw women who were treated as cutesies i didnt appreciate it and i said so myself if i felt that some of those women were not as professional as they could be i perhaps said it in a way i shouldnt have now that i look back i think i was quite arrogant in that way i should have probably been more supportive of other women who may not have had the training that i had and had the comfort level of doing hard news i probably should have been a little bit more supportive of them and i wasnt so when i look back i think i could have been better i could have been a better human being but i dont dwell on it now these are things that you learn as you grow older when youre out to carve a certain role for yourself you expect others to do the same and you shouldnt because all people are different and they all have their own strengths thats something that i wasnt as tolerant about page  page  moorhus were there any concerns or prejudices about your coming from the mainland tanabe some i remember when i first got here someone came and said so youre japaneseamerican right i said yeah my folks are from japan they said so you from here i said no oh well then youre a kotonk i said whats that its a local word to describe a japaneseamerican from the mainland kotonk is a japanese word which is sort of like the sound a barrel makes when its rolling down the street it goes kotonk kotonk kotonk kotonk its kind of a derogatory term so i said why are you describing me in that way he said well you know because knocking her head kotonk kotonk kotonk some japaneseamericans from the mainland are pretty emptyheaded anyway theres a long history to that term that dates back to world war ii when the japaneseamericans from here went to the mainland to train to be in the army thats when they met up with mainland americans of japanese ancestry they had differences and fought it out and thats where the term came out that when you beat up a mainlander you know laughter its very local humor but i remember i said you cant tag me with that because im from japan originally because i was born in japan then they said oh well youre a bobora which is the term for country bumpkin i said well thats not right either early on you learn that the local community does put labels on people but its more to try to understand where youre from and how they should communicate with you i said well okay if thats the way you folks want to do it thats fine but im going to tell you that im a professional and this is what i do so there were things that you had to overcome i think thats true with any community i was fortunate in seattle in that i went to school there and my family roots were in seattle i didnt have similar roots here so i had to work on it but it didnt impede me from anything it didnt stop people from inviting me into their homes or anything because once they figured out that i knew what i was doing and that i came not to exploit but to learn�i think ones attitude is always most important in being accepted and for this community that was important as father nakayama said youre there for the rest of your life and i was here with that kind of an attitude page  page  of course i missed seattle a lot during the first year i missed my family a lot you miss getting phone calls from your friends but you know thats what moving and developing a new community is all about moorhus why dont we stop at this point and pick up next time tanabe okay great page  go to session one  session three index  cover  home   washington press club foundation washington dc all rights reserved microsoft personalized
