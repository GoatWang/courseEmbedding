partnership hale partnership fund lp investment philosophy hale partnership’s investment philosophy has three basic tenets first capital markets have pockets of inefficiency due to the dominance of large institutional investment managers and the regulatory and investment mandate restrictions under which they operate second the most important aspect of any investment is asymmetry of reward versus risk undertaken third mispriced assets with catalysts to value realization provide the highest probability of achieving satisfactory absolute returns over the longterm through following these core values hale partnership feels it has a strategic niche that gives its investors an edge investment process the firm’s sourcing strategy focuses on sifting through inefficient areas within capital markets which include postreorganization equities micro capitalization equities distressed debt both bonds and loans and private bankruptcies our investment process involves extensive fundamental earning power analysis and independent industry research opportunities in these inefficient areas are further analyzed for optimal position within the existing capital structure portfolio construction the portfolio is concentrated in  positions at a given time the average position sizes are between  and  depending on the relative expected aftertax return and liquidity of each security the portfolio is not fully invested at all times and cash is held in the absence of attractive absolute return opportunities holding periods have averaged  years hale medical office building fund lp a delaware
