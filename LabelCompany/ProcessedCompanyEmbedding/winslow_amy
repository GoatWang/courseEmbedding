i can now tackle overseas expansion where lead poisoning is a serious problem however this adds regulatory and commercial complexity as well as new cultural and business issues i’m thinking a lot about navigating these challenges to find the fastest paths for growth amy winslow thinks the market for her company’s main products is tragically too big not that winslow whose magellan diagnostics makes leaddiagnostics equipment for physicians and laboratories isn’t prepared to tap into the growing national and international demand for products that can quickly identify whether patients especially children suffer from lead poisoning it’s more about how so many people and policymakers still don’t appreciate how widespread dangerous and preventable the threat is from leadbased products whether the lead is found in paint water pipes brass light fixtures or even food “it’s shocking” winslow head of magellan diagnostics since  said of the extent of lead contamination across the county and world “apathy is our biggest rival i feel passionate about this issue as both a professional and as a mother” with its sale last year to meridian bioscience for  million the north billericabased magellan diagnostics with  employees and revenue of  million when it was sold in early  now has the backing and opportunity to aggressively expand its market reach overseas where demand is high for its products especially it’s muchindemand leadcare ii a portable leaddiagnostics instrument that doctors can use in their own offices to test patients for lead poisoning for winslow her work at magellan and the opportunities that lie ahead are the culmination of a career that combined her talents interests and passions for both entrepreneurship and the sciences a native of the midwest whose family moved to the boston area when she was young winslow is the daughter of a tech entrepreneur father an executivesearch and venture capitalist mother and the granddaughter of a scientist and inventor who once taught at mit’s sloan school of management “it runs in the family” she says of the entrepreneurial and scientific interests she inherited after graduating from brown university with a degree in biology winslow has worked over the years usually on the business side as a product manager at cr bard a marketing manager for genzyme transgenics vice president for marketing for athena diagnostics and most recently as founder and owner of mw advisory a strategy and marketing consulting firm serving fastgrowing companies in novel diagnostic and device markets earlier this decade she was recruited to run a thensmall magellan diagnostics a spinoff from magellan biosciences and she was intrigued with its main product now known as leadcare ii among magellan’s other products today are leadcare plus and leadcare ultra geared toward laboratory clients but leadcare ii remains the backbone of its products line “our little system is loved by our clients” she said after consolidating operations and expanding its sales marketing and distribution teams winslow grew magellan from a person company to today’s  employees “amy is very thoughtful and strategic with a leadership style that is able to bring together people with disparate perspectives and backgrounds to work toward a common goal” says peter h glick former executive chairman at magellan diagnostics “she did a great job transforming a small product line into a fully integrated company and then using that platform to maximize the number of kids we could help protect from lead poisoning” when not running her company winslow the mother of two has been involved in organizations such as the boston museum of science and women in science and engineering which helps professional women in the sciences and pushes to increase interest among females in stemrelated fields she also blogs on huffington post to raise awareness about lead poisoning and prevention “people are becoming more aware” of lead poisoning she says “but we still have a long way to go” related content after flint billerica lead test maker targets risk for pregnant women industries technology human resources topics bioscience suggested

important considerations when sourcing hardware products online optimizing packaging for major retailers for hardware startups → getting your hardware product into retail with amy wenslow of product to profits april   amy wenslow is the ceo of products to profits a consulting company that specializes in helping small businesses  hardware startups get their products onto the shelves of retail stores there aren’t a lot of resources focused on how to grow a hardware startup into a business post crowdfunding  a lot of attention has been given to developing a product and then crowdfunding the product however if you truly want grow into a hardware business you’re going to have to scale and get into retail to sell your product to more consumers so it is with great excitement that we were able to ask amy some questions and have her share advice with our readers on getting products into retail  this is your opportunity to get some free insiderinformation that can help you to take your business to the next level questions and answers greg i have the pleasure of having amy winslow founder of a great company called products to profits today she is going to help us learn a little bit more about how to take products to market thanks amy for joining us amy you are absolutely welcome greg i am really excited when i get a chance to talk with people that are launching new projects and putting something innovative out in the space greg one of the questions that come up often amongst hardware startups is how to get connected to buyers what do you suggest startups can do to start reaching out and make that connection amy when you’re looking to connect with a buyer one of the first things you want to do is try to work with the connections and contacts you have in your network number one thing to focus on is making sure you are talking to the right people we see people make the mistake of finding a contact with a walmart buyer or a target buyer and when they call and first speak to them they go “blaalalalalalalala” all about their products then it turns out it’s not even the right category buyer or it’s an assistant buyer so you want pay attention to the categories that the buyers are working in because there are a host of buyers at every one of the large corporations that buy different categories of products second you want to make sure that your pitch is concise  if you’re doing the pitch in email make sure to proof read it for grammar your pitch should be personable and friendly but it has to put forth the case of why your product earns a place in their store i really want to stress that the buyer is interested in how much money your product is going to generate per square foot in their location even with online sales it’s how much of your product are you going to be able to sell the more prepared you are in the beginning of the conversation the more it sets you up to look like you’re going to be an amazing partner for them greg what are some of those key numbers or key points that you should make sure to address you know in that first phone call or that first email amy the first thing you’ll want to address is if you have any sales history with them  for example if you are moving from selling with target online to target instore they are going to be able to look at the online sales history you’ll want to be able to address questions around any little glitches or things like being out of stock for a month or your sales tanking online you’ll want that information prepared and ready to be addressed but don’t lead with it and say “well you know when you look at your sales history you’re going to see there was a dip in february” some other things you should be prepared to talk about are the sales numbers the costs delivery timelines and how long until the first order  you want to have your data about the product lined up which means having upc codes that are right and descriptions that are right  have the back office of your product set up because if they like it they’ll ask for forms pretty quickly and you want to make sure you’ve got those pieces in place greg great information yeah we have seen a number of startups go through that cycle and not be prepared for those next steps amy it’s such a speed bump that takes emotional energy out of your sales and the pace can get a bit exhausting sometimes greg what are some of the things that buyers are looking for in new products amy well iot is obviously huge with buyers but one of the main things that they’re looking for is – how is this product driving sales when you’re talking to a buyer the things they look at are is it relevant to their consumer meaning – does this product work for the market they sell to they are going to look for products and the see if they into the market that they are serving you want to have good packaging in place with upc’s that are set up properly for the area you want to sell into the buyer is also going to look at do you have good instructions do you have sales history  when you send in your sell sheets have them be clear send some lifestyle images that show the story of the product and talk about the benefits not the features a lot of people making products will focus a lot on the features of their product but people and buyers really want to know what the benefits are of using your product who’s going to use it and is it their market those are the really big pieces to cover greg absolutely how is it going to change their life in a unique way right amy and are the benefits a positive thing does the buyer see that somebody is going to naturally understand your product and see that it’s for him or her packaging has to support that experience as well so that you can get the best price on the product which gives you and buyers store location the best profit margin you both can get greg many of our startups haven’t developed sales yet but they maybe had a great crowdfunding campaign with some numbers that can be pretty compelling how do you see that fitting into the buyer relationship amy it fits really well if you have done a great crowdfunding campaign you should hopefully have some data about what had people donate or what compelled people to click on an ad if you ran ads and tested a bunch of different messages that’ll tell you what features are most important about the product by running facebook or twitter ads you can frequently get demographic information about who actually clicked on your ads this can be huge when you’re talking to buyers because you can say this product does really well with a certain demographic you can also angle your sales presentation and say you found a certain feature of your product was popular and drove our sales you can also mention you see the buyer’s customers purchase other products that have similar features greg so they’re looking for both marketing information to make sure that it’s the right fit for their demographic and their category amy yeah absolutely investors are always looking at crowdfunding platform statistics to see what’s driving the success with crowdfunding campaigns one of the big points about crowdfunding is making sure products raise enough money to actually deliver on the gift that they get in exchange for the donation because that’s really the right way to be talking about it it’s much better for your business to say donation with gift then to say presales of product that’s a best practices nuance but you have to raise enough money to actually deliver on the reward then the other part is to make sure the company stays in communication with the early adopters because they’ll spring gorge you and you can get testimonials that’ll help you with buyers which in return can help you with other sales greg what do you see as some of the biggest mistakes among startups that are trying to develop those relationships amy the biggest mistake a startup business can make when trying to develop buyer relationships is to randomly go to every contact they can find we always recommend that people separate the opportunities into three buckets or tiers if you know that this product should be selling in a nordstrom or best buy then you don’t go sell it to costco first  i see people take any opportunity that comes across as a good opportunity and they try to make it work but that’s not the case some opportunities will kill the bigger strategies of your business if you take costco orders first and you set weird pricing you may never get the highend order a very big piece of advice is to keep your opportunities in sequence other challenges people face are putting off dealing with some of the infrastructure of their business i would really recommend getting professional help with things like your accounting it will save you time effort and help build momentum a lot quicker than of you had done or learned it by yourself my advice is to hire the expertise and learn alongside them greg we have certainly found besides just the knowledge and the experience of doing it you also get those relationships the network all of those maybe good ideas that tried and failed and all the understanding from that that is a little bit under the surface that really goes a long way to moving quick and getting sales and early ramping up amy i am a big fan of learning from other peoples mistakes so that i don’t have to make them all myself greg yes absolutely it’s enough mistakes to make by yourself right amy exactly so i love that question thank you for asking it i want to just finish up with one piece here and i’d really encourage everybody to keep in mind that if you’re talking about your business as a small business you actually are limiting it i really encourage people to think about their business in terms of where it’s going and to get committed to that vision the reality is that the majority of jobs and economic growth in this country comes from small businesses they come from innovation and somebody thinking creative and taking action i just really want to make sure that everybody keeps that in mind – it’s not just a small business you’re running a business  you’re expanding and growing into it all the time no matter where you are greg that vision goes a long way to really framing the kinds of questions and how you answer those questions i think certainly amy i’d really like to invite your community to come on to the live qa calls that i do every other monday they are on our website homepage – people can see more there you can find that at wwwproductstoprofitscom we specialize in working with hardware and consumer products that want to go to very large volume sales quickly effectively and in the smoothest way possible conclusion well there you go there’s certainly a lot of information to take away from that and hopefully you learned something from the discussion – we sure did while there is an awful lot to sift through there a number of things really stand out one is to make sure you do your research if you’re approaching a buyer then know your numbers especially if you’re already selling likewise make sure that you’re collecting qualitative information from your backers and site visitors rather than just looking at the quantitative data don’t ask how many clicks your ad has – ask who has been clicking it keep an eye on the internet of things if you’re looking for new hardware opportunities and don’t take every opportunity that comes your way stay focused on your bigger strategies we are very grateful to amy
