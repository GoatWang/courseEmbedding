user name  password  form submitted successfully too many failed attempts please contact ovation partners for the correct username  password strategy fund about contact ovation partners introduction our investment strategy ovation invests in niche markets where the supply of capital is scarce relative to the demand for capital management team ovation’s goals are to preserve our investor’s capital generate returns with low correlation to public markets and provide quarterly distributions we believe in balancing a conservative focus on absolute returns while remaining nimble as markets evolve ovation prefers to focus on principal protection and downside mitigation the niche markets where we focus are generally smaller in size and the need for operational expertise makes them difficult for larger financial institutions to source and service ovation believes it has advantaged access evaluation or origination capabilities in these markets ovation’s investment selection emphasizes cash flow collateral short duration and the ability to reprice there is no mandate to benchmark to any index thereby creating an artificial constraint that may restrict ovation’s ability to achieve its stated objectives while many of these niche markets have existed for more than  years and have a history of generating attractive returns the disruption and subsequent fragmentation of the broader credit markets since  has increased the relative isolation of these niche markets versus public credit investments corporate high grade and high yield bonds eg bank consolidation and increased regulation has resulted in a concentration of capital availability to only the larger borrowers through the issuance of public bonds or syndicated loans the market for public credit is highly liquid and can be easily accessed by nearly all investors globally as a result the substantial inflow of capital into public credit markets has lowered returns to investors ovation believes the assets in the private credit and specialty finance markets may offer a better riskreturn profile to their public counterparts these assets may include but are not limited to tax lien loans municipal tax liens first
