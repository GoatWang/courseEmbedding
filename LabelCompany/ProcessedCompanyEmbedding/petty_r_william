william petty nd earl of shelburne praised her as a woman of strong character and intelligence the only person who could manage her badtempered and tyrannical husband economic works and theories overviewedit economic writings  before discussing pettys economic theories it is important to point out two crucial influences in his lifetone the first is thomas hobbes for whom petty acted as personal secretary according to hobbes theory should set out the rational requirements for civil peace and material plenty as hobbes had centred on peace petty chose prosperitycitation needed secondly the influence of francis bacon was profound bacon and indeed hobbes held the conviction that mathematics and the senses must be the basis of all rational sciences this passion for accuracy led petty to famously declare that his form of science would only use measurable phenomena and would seek quantitative precision rather than rely on comparatives or superlatives yielding a new subject that he named political arithmetic petty thus carved a niche for himself as the first dedicated economic scientist amidst the merchantpamphleteers such as thomas mun or josiah child and philosopherscientists occasionally discussing economics such as john locke he was indeed writing before the true development of political economy as such many of his claims for precision are of imperfect quality nonetheless petty wrote three main works on economics treatise of taxes and contributions written in  verbum sapienti  and quantulumcunque concerning money  all refreshingly conciseeditorializing these works which received great attention in the s show his theories on major areas of what would later become economics what follows is an analysis of his most important theories those on fiscal contributions national wealth the money supply and circulation velocity value the interest rate international trade and government investment fiscal contributionsedit fiscal contributions were of prime concern to policymakers in the th century as they have remained ever since for the wise country would not spend above its revenues by pettys time england was engaged in war with holland and in the first three chapters of treatise of taxes and contributions petty sought to establish principles of taxation and public expenditure to which the monarch could adhere when deciding how to raise money for the war petty lists six kinds of public charge namely defence governance the pastorage of mens souls education the maintenance of impotents of all sorts and infrastructure or things of universal good he then discusses general and particular causes of changes in these charges he thinks that there is great scope for reduction of the first four public charges and recommends increased spending on care for the elderly sick orphans etc as well as the government employment of supernumeraries on the issue of raising taxes petty was a definite proponent of consumption taxes he recommended that in general taxes should be just sufficient to meet the various types of public charges that he listed they should also be horizontally equitable regular and proportionate he condemned poll taxes as very unequal and excise on beer as taxing the poor excessively he recommended a much higher quality of statistical information to raise taxes more fairly imports should be taxed but only in such a way that would put them on a level playing field with domestic produce a vital aspect of economies at this time was that they were transforming from barter economies to money economies linked to this and aware of the scarcity of money petty recommends that taxes be payable in forms other than gold or silver which he estimated to be less than  of national wealth to him too much importance was placed on money which is to the whole effect of the kingdom… not even one to  national income accountingedit in making the above estimate petty introduced in the first two chapters of verbum sapienti the first rigorous assessments of national income and wealth to him it was all too obvious that a countrys wealth lay in more than just gold and silver he worked off an estimation that the average personal income was £ s d per annum with a population of six million meaning that national income would be £m pettys theory produced estimates some more reliable than others for the various components of national income including land ships personal estates and housing he then distinguished between the stocks £m and the flows yielding from them £m the discrepancy between these flows and his estimate for national income £m leads petty to postulate that the other £m is the yield from what must be £m of labour stock the value of the people this gave a total wealth for england in the s of £m statisticianedit sir william petty pettys only statistical technique is the use of simple averages he would not be a statistician by todays standards but during his time a statistician was merely one that employed the use of quantitative data because obtaining census data was difficult if not impossible especially for ireland he applied methods of estimation the way in which he would estimate the population would be to start with estimating the population of london he would do this by either estimating it by exports or by deaths his method of using exports is by considering that a  percent increase in exports corresponds to a similar proportionate increase in population the way he would use deaths would be by multiplying the number of deaths by  – estimating that one out of thirty people die each year to obtain the population of all of england he would multiply the population of london by  such a simple use of estimation could have easily have been abused and petty was accused more than once of doctoring the figures for the crown henry spiegel money supply and the velocity of its circulationedit this figure for the stock of wealth was contrasted with a money supply in gold and silver of only £m petty believed that there was a certain amount of money that a nation needed to drive its trade hence it was possible to have too little money circulating in an economy which would mean that people would have to rely on barter it would also be possible for there to be too much money in an economy but the topical question was as he asks in chapter  of verbum sapienti would £m be enough to drive a nations trade especially if the king wanted to raise additional funds for the war with holland the answer for petty lay in the velocity of moneys circulation anticipating the quantity theory of money often said to be initiated by john locke whereby yp  msv petty stated that if y was to be increased for a given money supply revolutions must occur in smaller circles ie higher va this could be done through the establishment of a bank he explicitly stated in verbum sapienti nor is money wanting to answer all the ends of a well policed state notwithstanding the great decreases thereof which have happened within these twenty years and that higher velocity is the answer he also mentions that there is nothing unique about gold and silver in fulfilling the functions of money and that money is the means to an end not the end itself nor were it hard to substitute in the place of money gold and silver were a comptency of it wanting what should be equivalent unto it for money is but the fat of the bodypolitick whereof too much doth often hinder its agility as too little makes it sick so doth money in the state quicken its action feeds from abroad in the time of dearth at home what is striking about these passages is his intellectual rigour which put him far ahead of the mercantilist writers of earlier in the century it is also interesting to note the use of biological analogies to illustrate his point a trend continued by the physiocrats in france early in the th century theory of valueedit on value petty continued the debate begun by aristotle and chose to develop an inputbased theory of value all things ought to be valued by two natural denominations which is land and labour p  both of these would be prime sources of taxable income like richard cantillon after him he sought to devise some equation or par between the mother and father of output land and labour and to express value accordingly he still included general productivity ones art and industry he applied his theory of value to rent the natural rent of a land was the excess of what a labourer produces on it in a year over what he ate himself and traded for necessities it was therefore the profit above the various costs related to the factors involved in production the interest rateedit the natural rate of rent is related to his theories on usury at the time many religious writers still condemned the charging of interest as sinful petty also involved himself in the debate on usury and interest rates regarding the phenomenon as a reward for forbearance on the part of the lender incorporating his theories of value he asserted that with perfect security the rate of interest should equal the rent for land that the principal could have bought – again a precocious insight into what would later become general equilibrium findings where security was more casual the return should be greater – a return for risk having established the justification for usury itself that of forbearance he then shows his hobbesian qualities arguing against any government regulation of the interest rate pointing to the vanity and fruitlessness of making civil positive laws against the laws of nature laissezfaire governanceedit this is one of the major themes of pettys writings summed up by his use of the phrase vadere sicut vult whence we get laissezfaire as mentioned earlier the motif of medicine was also useful to petty and he warned against overinterference by the government in the economy seeing it as analogous to a physician tampering excessively with his patient he applied this to monopolies controls on the exportation of money and on the trade of commodities they were to him vain and harmful to a nation he recognised the price effects of monopolies citing the french kings salt monopoly as an example in another work political arithmetic petty also recognised the importance of economies of scale he described the phenomenon of the division of labour asserting that a good is both of better quality and cheaper if many work on it petty said that the gain is greater as the manufacture itself is greater foreign exchange and control of tradeedit on the efflux of specie petty thought it vain to try to control it and dangerous as it would leave the merchants to decide what goods a nation buys with the smaller amount of money he noted in quantulumcunque concerning money that countries plentiful in gold have no such laws restricting specie on exports in general he regarded prescriptions such as recent acts of parliament forbidding the export of wool and yarn as burthensome further restrictions would do us twice as much harm as the losse of our said trade p  albeit with a concession that he is no expert in the study of the wool trade on prohibiting imports for example from holland such restrictions did little other than drive up prices and were only useful if imports vastly exceeded exports petty saw far more use in going to holland and learning whatever skills they have than trying to resist nature epitomizing his viewpoint he thought it preferable to sell cloth for debauching foreign wines rather than leave the clothiers unemployed full employmentedit the goal of full employment was of most importance to petty having recognised that labour was one of the major sources of wealth for individuals and the greatest wealth and strength of the kingdom in this vein he extended the clothwine argument above arguing that it is better to employ men and burn their product or to engage in extravagant public works projects than to have indolent supernumeraries in an economy – hence his famous example of relocating stonehenge across the plains of salisbury division of labouredit in his political arithmetick petty made a practical study of the division of labour showing its existence and usefulness in dutch shipyards classically the workers in a shipyard would build ships as units finishing one before starting another but the dutch had it organised with several teams each doing the same tasks for successive ships people with a particular task to do must have discovered new methods that were only later observed and justified by writers on political economy petty also applied the principle to his survey of ireland his breakthrough was to divide up the work so that large parts of it could be done by people with no extensive training urban societyedit petty projected the growth of the city of london and supposed that it might swallow the rest of england – not so far from what actually happened now if the city double its people in  years and the present number be  and if the whole territory be  and double in  years as aforesaid then by the underwritten table it appears that ad  the people of the city will be  and those of the whole country but  which is but inconsiderably more wherefore it is certain and necessary that the growth of the city must stop before the said year  and will be at its utmost height in the next preceding period ad  when the number of the city will be eight times its present number  and when besides the said number there will be  to perform the tillage pasturage and other rural works necessary to be done without the said city he imagined a future in which the city of london is seven times bigger than now and that the inhabitants of it are  people and that in all the other cities ports towns and villages there are but  more he expected this some time round  extrapolating existing trends long before malthus he noticed the potential of human population to increase but he also saw no reason why such a society should not be prosperous summary and legacyedit the above shows the contribution petty made to theoretical issues that have dominated the later subject of economics ever since he covered such a wide range of topics according to his political arithmetic method ie like modern economists he set out to prove his claims by finding data and statistics rather than relying on anecdotal evidence he wrote rigorously but also with concision and humour the issues that petty thought about and wrote are major topics that have plagued the minds of economic theorists ever since he influenced not only immediate successors such as richard cantillon but also some of the greatest minds in economics including adam smith karl marx and john maynard keynes with adam smith he shared a world view that believed in a harmonious natural world the parallels in their canons of taxation epitomise their joint belief in natural liberty and equality they both saw the benefits of specialisation and the division of labour furthermore smith and petty developed labour theories of value as did david ricardo henry george and karl marx in the th century smith said nothing about petty in the wealth of nations in his published writings there is nothing apart for a reference in a letter to lord shelburne one of pettys aristocratic descendants petty continued to exercise influence karl marx thought as did petty that the total effort put in by the aggregate of ordinary workers represented a far greater contribution to the economy than contemporary ideas recognised this belief led petty to conclude in his estimates that labour ranked as the greatest source of wealth in the kingdom by contrast marxs conclusions were that surplus labour was the source of all profit and that the labourer was alienated from his surplus and thus from society marxs high esteem of adam smith is mirrored in his consideration of pettys analysis as witnessed by countless quotations in his major work das kapital john maynard keynes also wrote at a time of mass discord as unemployment was rampant and economies stagnant during the s he showed how governments could manage aggregate demand to stimulate output and employment much as petty had done with simpler examples in the th century pettys simple £throughhands multiplier was refined by keynes

and dangerous as it would leave the merchants to decide what goods a nation buys with the smaller amount of money he noted in quantulumcunque concerning money that countries plentiful in gold have no

twice as much harm as the losse of our said trade p  albeit with a concession that he is no expert in the study of the wool trade on prohibiting imports for example from holland such restrictions did little other than drive up prices and were only useful if imports vastly exceeded exports petty saw far more use in going to holland and learning whatever skills they have than trying to resist nature

the parliament of england briefly and was also a scientist inventor and entrepreneur and was a charter member of the royal society it is for his theories on economics and his methods of political

writings preadam smith of particular interest were pettys forays into statistical analysis pettys work in political arithmetic along with the work of john graunt laid the foundation for modern census techniques moreover this work in statistical analysis when further expanded by writers like josiah child documented some of the first expositions of modern insurance vernon louis parrington notes him as an early expositor of the labour theory of value as discussed in treatise of taxes in  in  henry pettyfitzmaurice rd marquess of lansdowne one of pettys descendants erected a memorial and likeness of petty in romsey abbey the text on it reads a true patriot and a sound philosopher who by his powerful intellect his scientific works and indefatigable industry became a benefactor to his family and an ornament to his country his grave slab on the floor of the south choir aisle reads here layes sir william pety early lifeedit pettys father and grandfather were clothiers he was a precocious and intelligent youngster and became a cabin boy in  but was set ashore in normandy after breaking his leg on board after this setback he applied in latin to study with the jesuits in caen supporting himself by teaching english after a year he returned to england and had by now a thorough knowledge of latin greek french mathematics and astronomy after an uneventful period in the navy he left to study in holland in  where he developed an interest in anatomy through an english professor in amsterdam he became the personal secretary to hobbes allowing him contact with descartes gassendi and mersenne in  he returned to england and after developing a doublewriting instrument with little success in sales he studied medicine at oxford university he befriended hartlib and boyle and he became a member of the oxford philosophical club academic and surveyoredit by  petty was an anatomy instructor at brasenose college oxford as deputy to thomas clayton the younger he was also gresham professor of music in london william petty c  in  he left on a leave of absence and travelled with oliver cromwells army in ireland as physiciangeneral his opposition to conventional universities being committed to new science as inspired by francis bacon and imparted by his aforementioned acquaintances perhaps pushed him from oxford he was pulled to ireland perhaps by sense of ambition and desire for wealth and power his breadth of interests was such that he successfully secured the contract for charting ireland in  so that those who had lent funds to cromwells army might be repaid in land – a means of ensuring the army was selffinancing this enormous task he completed in  and became known as the down survey later published  as hiberniae delineatio as his reward he acquired approximately  acres  km in kenmare in southwest ireland and £  this personal gain to petty led to persistent court cases on charges of bribery and breach of trust until his death back in england as a cromwellian supporter he ran successfully for parliament in  for west looe natural philosopheredit despite his political allegiances petty was welltreated at the restoration in  although he lost some of his irish lands in  he was a charter member of the royal society of the same year this year also saw him write his first work on economics his treatise of taxes and contributions petty counted among his many scientific interests naval architecture he had become convinced of the superiority of doublehulled boats although they were not always successful the experiment reached porto on  but sank on the way back ireland and later lifeedit petty was knighted in  by charles ii and returned to ireland in  where he remained for most of the next twenty years the events that took him from oxford to ireland marked a shift from medicine and the physical sciences to the social sciences and petty lost all his oxford offices the social sciences became the area that he studied for the rest of his life his primary interest became irelands prosperity and his works describe that country and propose many remedies for its then backward condition he helped found the dublin society in  returning ultimately to london in  he died in  he regarded his life in bittersweet terms he had risen from humble origins to mix with the intellectual elite and was by  a considerably wealthy man and leading member of the progressive sciences nonetheless he was insecure about his land holdings and his ambitions of obtaining important political posts remained frustrated perhaps he expected the astronomical rise he experienced in his early years to continue throughout his life contemporaries described him nonetheless as humorous goodnatured and rational familyedit william petty married elizabeth waller in  she was a daughter of sir hardress waller she had been married with sir maurice fenton who died  she was given the title baroness shelburne for life they had three surviving children charles petty st baron shelburne henry petty st earl of shelburne anne who married thomas fitzmaurice st earl of kerry neither charles nor henry had male issue and the shelburne title passed to annes son john petty st earl of shelburne who took his mothers surname and whose descendants hold the title marquis of lansdowne her grandson william petty nd earl of shelburne praised her as a woman of strong character and intelligence the only person who could manage her badtempered and tyrannical husband economic works and theories overviewedit economic writings  before discussing pettys economic theories it is important to point out two crucial influences in his lifetone the first is thomas hobbes for whom petty acted as personal secretary according to hobbes theory should set out the rational requirements for civil peace and material plenty as hobbes had centred on peace petty chose prosperitycitation needed secondly the influence of francis bacon was profound bacon and indeed hobbes held the conviction that mathematics and the senses must be the basis of all rational sciences this passion for accuracy led petty to famously declare that his form of science would only use measurable phenomena and would seek quantitative precision rather than rely on comparatives or superlatives yielding a new subject that he named political arithmetic petty thus carved a niche for himself as the first dedicated economic scientist amidst the merchantpamphleteers such as thomas mun or josiah child and philosopherscientists occasionally discussing economics such as john locke he was indeed writing before the true development of political economy as such many of his claims for precision are of imperfect quality nonetheless petty wrote three main works on economics treatise of taxes and contributions written in  verbum sapienti  and quantulumcunque concerning money  all refreshingly conciseeditorializing these works which received great attention in the s show his theories on major areas of what would later become economics what follows is an analysis of his most important theories those on fiscal contributions national wealth the money supply and circulation velocity value the interest rate international trade and government investment fiscal contributionsedit fiscal contributions were of prime concern to policymakers in the th century as they have remained ever since for the wise country would not spend above its revenues by pettys time england was engaged in war with holland and in the first three chapters of treatise of taxes and contributions petty sought to establish principles of taxation and public expenditure to which the monarch could adhere when deciding how to raise money for the war petty lists six kinds of public charge namely defence governance the pastorage of mens souls education the maintenance of impotents of all sorts and infrastructure or things of universal good he then discusses general and particular causes of changes in these charges he thinks that there is great scope for reduction of the first four public charges and recommends increased spending on care for the elderly sick orphans etc as well as the government employment of supernumeraries on the issue of raising taxes petty was a definite proponent of consumption taxes he recommended that in general taxes should be just sufficient to meet the various types of public charges that he listed they should also be horizontally equitable regular and proportionate he condemned poll taxes as very unequal and excise on beer as taxing the poor excessively he recommended a much higher quality of statistical information to raise taxes more fairly imports should be taxed but only in such a way that would put them on a level playing field with domestic produce a vital aspect of economies at this time was that they were transforming from barter economies to money economies linked to this and aware of the scarcity of money petty recommends that taxes be payable in forms other than gold or silver which he estimated to be less than  of national wealth to him too much importance was placed on money which is to the whole effect of the kingdom… not even one to  national income accountingedit in making the above estimate petty introduced in the first two chapters of verbum sapienti the first rigorous assessments of national income and wealth to him it was all too obvious that a countrys wealth lay in more than just gold and silver he worked off an estimation that the average personal income was £ s d per annum with a population of six million meaning that national income would be £m pettys theory produced estimates some more reliable than others for the various components of national income including land ships personal estates and housing he then distinguished between the stocks £m and the flows yielding from them £m the discrepancy between these flows and his estimate for national income £m leads petty to postulate that the other £m is the yield from what must be £m of labour stock the value of the people this gave a total wealth for england in the s of £m statisticianedit sir william petty pettys only statistical technique is the use of simple averages he would not be a statistician by todays standards but during his time a statistician was merely one that employed the use of quantitative data because obtaining census data was difficult if not impossible especially for ireland he applied methods of estimation the way in which he would estimate the population would be to start with estimating the population of london he would do this by either estimating it by exports or by deaths his method of using exports is by considering that a  percent increase in exports corresponds to a similar proportionate increase in population the way he would use deaths would be by multiplying the number of deaths by  – estimating that one out of thirty people die each year to obtain the population of all of england he would multiply the population of london by  such a simple use of estimation could have easily have been abused and petty was accused more than once of doctoring the figures for the crown henry spiegel money supply and the velocity of its circulationedit this figure for the stock of wealth was contrasted with a money supply in gold and silver of only £m petty believed that there was a certain amount of money that a nation needed to drive its trade hence it was possible to have too little money circulating in an economy which would mean that people would have to rely on barter it would also be possible for there to be too much money in an economy but the topical question was as he asks in chapter  of verbum sapienti would £m be enough to drive a nations trade especially if the king wanted to raise additional funds for the war with holland the answer for petty lay in the velocity of moneys circulation anticipating the quantity theory of money often said to be initiated by john locke whereby yp  msv petty stated that if y was to be increased for a given money supply revolutions must occur in smaller circles ie higher va this could be done through the establishment of a bank he explicitly stated in verbum sapienti nor is money wanting to answer all the ends of a well policed state notwithstanding the great decreases thereof which have happened within these twenty

among his many scientific interests naval architecture he had become convinced of the superiority of doublehulled boats although they were not always successful the experiment reached porto on  but sank on the way back ireland and later lifeedit petty was knighted in  by charles ii and returned to ireland in  where he remained for most of the next twenty years the events that took him from oxford to ireland marked a shift from medicine and the physical sciences to the social sciences and petty lost all his oxford offices the social sciences became the area that he studied for the rest of his life his primary interest became irelands prosperity and his works describe that country and propose many remedies for its then backward condition he helped found the dublin society in  returning ultimately to london in  he died in  he regarded his life in bittersweet terms he had risen from humble origins to mix with the intellectual elite and was by  a considerably wealthy man and leading member of the progressive sciences nonetheless he was insecure about his land holdings and his ambitions of obtaining important political posts remained frustrated perhaps he expected the astronomical rise he experienced in his early years to continue throughout his life contemporaries described him nonetheless as humorous goodnatured and rational familyedit william petty married elizabeth waller in  she was a daughter of sir hardress waller she had been married with sir maurice fenton who died  she was given the title baroness shelburne for life they had three surviving children charles petty st baron shelburne henry petty st earl of shelburne anne who married thomas fitzmaurice st earl of kerry neither charles nor henry had male issue and the shelburne title passed to annes son john petty st earl of shelburne who took his mothers surname and whose descendants hold the title marquis of lansdowne her grandson william petty nd earl of shelburne praised her as a woman of strong character and intelligence the only person who could manage her badtempered and tyrannical husband economic works and theories overviewedit economic writings  before discussing pettys economic theories it is important to point out two crucial influences in his lifetone the first is thomas hobbes for whom petty acted as personal secretary according to hobbes theory should set out the rational requirements for civil peace and material plenty as hobbes had centred on peace petty chose prosperitycitation needed secondly the influence of francis bacon was profound bacon and indeed hobbes held the conviction that mathematics and the senses must be the basis of all rational sciences this passion for accuracy led petty to famously declare that his form of science would only use measurable phenomena and would seek quantitative precision rather than rely on comparatives or superlatives yielding a new subject that he named political arithmetic petty thus carved a niche for himself as the first dedicated economic scientist amidst the merchantpamphleteers such as thomas mun or josiah child and philosopherscientists occasionally discussing economics such as john locke he was indeed writing before the true development of political economy as such many of his claims for precision are of imperfect quality nonetheless petty wrote three main works on economics treatise of taxes and contributions written in  verbum sapienti  and quantulumcunque concerning money  all refreshingly conciseeditorializing these works which received great attention in the s show his theories on major areas of what would later become economics what follows is an analysis of his most important theories those on fiscal contributions national wealth the money supply and circulation velocity value the interest rate international trade and government investment fiscal contributionsedit fiscal contributions were of prime concern to policymakers in the th century as they have remained ever since for the wise country would not spend above its revenues by pettys time england was engaged in war with holland and in the first three chapters of treatise of taxes and contributions petty sought to establish principles of taxation and public expenditure to which the monarch could adhere when deciding how to raise money for the war petty lists six kinds of public charge namely defence governance the pastorage of mens souls education the maintenance of impotents of all sorts and infrastructure or things of universal good he then discusses general and particular causes of changes in these charges he thinks that there is great scope for reduction of the first four public charges and recommends increased spending on care for the elderly sick orphans etc as well as the government employment of supernumeraries on the issue of raising taxes petty was a definite proponent of consumption taxes he recommended that in general taxes should be just sufficient to meet the various types of public charges that he listed they should also be horizontally equitable regular and proportionate he condemned poll taxes as very unequal and excise on beer as taxing the poor excessively he recommended a much higher quality of statistical information to raise taxes more fairly imports should be taxed but only in such a way that would put them on a level playing field with domestic produce a vital aspect of economies at this time was that they were transforming from barter economies to money economies linked to this and aware of the scarcity of money petty recommends that taxes be payable in forms other than gold or silver which he estimated to be less than  of national wealth to him too much importance was placed on money which is to the whole effect of the kingdom… not even one to  national income accountingedit in making the above estimate petty introduced in the first two chapters of verbum sapienti the first rigorous assessments of national income and wealth to him it was all too obvious that a countrys wealth lay in more than just gold and silver he worked off an estimation that the average personal income was £ s d per annum with a population of six million meaning that national income would be £m pettys theory produced estimates some more reliable than others for the various components of national income including land ships personal estates and housing he then distinguished between the stocks £m and the flows yielding from them £m the discrepancy between these flows and his estimate for national income £m leads petty to postulate that the other £m is the yield from what must be £m of labour stock the value of the people this gave a total wealth for england in the s of £m statisticianedit sir william petty pettys only statistical technique is the use of simple averages he would not be a statistician by todays standards but during his time a statistician was merely one that employed the use of quantitative data because obtaining census data was difficult if not impossible especially for ireland he applied methods of estimation the way in which he would estimate the population would be to start with estimating the population of london he would do this by either estimating it by exports or by deaths his method of using exports is by considering that a  percent increase in exports corresponds to a similar proportionate increase in population the way he would use deaths would be by multiplying the number of deaths by  – estimating that one out of thirty people die each year to obtain the population of all of england he would multiply the population of london by  such a simple use of estimation could have easily have been abused and petty was accused more than once of doctoring the figures for the crown henry spiegel money supply and the velocity of its circulationedit this figure for the stock of wealth was contrasted with a money supply in gold and silver of only £m petty believed that there was a certain amount of money that a nation needed to drive its trade hence it was possible to have too little money circulating in an economy which would mean that people would have to rely on barter it would also be possible for there to be too much money in an economy but the topical question was as he asks in chapter  of verbum sapienti would £m be enough to drive a nations trade especially if the king wanted to raise additional funds for the war with holland the answer for petty lay in the velocity of moneys circulation anticipating the quantity theory of money often said to be initiated by john locke whereby yp  msv petty stated that if y was to be increased for a given money supply revolutions must occur in smaller circles ie higher va this could be done through the establishment of a bank he explicitly stated in verbum sapienti nor is money wanting to answer all the ends of a well policed state notwithstanding the great decreases thereof which have happened within these twenty years and that higher velocity is the answer he also mentions that there is nothing unique about gold and silver in fulfilling the functions of money and that money is the means to an end not the end itself nor were it hard to substitute in the place of money gold and silver were a comptency of it wanting what should be equivalent unto it for money is but the fat of the bodypolitick whereof too much doth often hinder its agility as too little makes it sick so doth money in the state quicken its action feeds from abroad in the time of dearth at home what is striking about these passages is his intellectual rigour which put him far ahead of the mercantilist writers of earlier in the century it is also interesting to note the use of biological analogies to illustrate his point a trend continued by the physiocrats in france early in the th century theory of valueedit on value petty continued the debate begun by aristotle and chose to develop an inputbased theory of value all things ought to be valued by two natural denominations which is land and labour p  both of these would be prime sources of taxable income like richard cantillon after him he sought to devise some equation or par between the mother and father of output land and labour and to express value accordingly he still included general productivity ones art and industry he applied his theory of value to rent the natural rent of a land was the excess of what a labourer produces on it in a year over what he ate himself and traded for necessities it was therefore the profit above the various costs related to the factors involved in production the interest rateedit the natural rate of rent is related to his theories on usury at the time many religious writers still condemned the charging of interest as sinful petty also involved himself in the debate on usury and interest rates regarding the phenomenon as a reward for forbearance on the part of the lender incorporating his theories of value he asserted that with perfect security the rate of interest should equal the rent for land that the principal could have bought – again a precocious insight into what would later become general equilibrium findings where security was more casual the return should be greater – a return for risk having established the justification for usury itself that of forbearance he then shows his hobbesian qualities arguing against any government regulation of the interest rate pointing to the vanity and fruitlessness of making civil positive laws against the laws of nature laissezfaire governanceedit this is one of the major themes of pettys writings summed up by his use of the phrase vadere sicut vult whence we get laissezfaire as mentioned earlier the motif of medicine was also useful to petty and he warned against overinterference by the government in the economy seeing it as analogous to a physician tampering excessively with his patient he applied this to monopolies controls on the exportation of money and on the trade of commodities they were to him vain and harmful to a nation he recognised the price effects of monopolies citing the french kings salt monopoly as an example in another work political arithmetic petty also recognised the importance of economies of scale he described the phenomenon of the division of labour asserting that a good is both of better quality and cheaper if many work on it petty said that the gain is greater as the manufacture itself is greater foreign exchange and control of tradeedit on the efflux of specie petty thought it vain to try to control it and dangerous as it would leave the merchants to decide what goods a nation buys with the smaller amount of money he noted in quantulumcunque concerning money that countries plentiful in gold have no such laws restricting specie on exports in general he regarded prescriptions such as recent acts of parliament forbidding the export of wool and yarn as burthensome further restrictions would do us twice as much harm as the losse of our said trade p  albeit with a concession that he is no expert in the study of the wool trade on prohibiting imports for example from holland such restrictions did little other than drive up prices and were only useful if imports vastly exceeded exports petty saw far more use in going to holland and learning whatever skills they have than trying to resist nature epitomizing his viewpoint he thought it preferable to sell cloth for debauching foreign wines rather than leave the clothiers unemployed full employmentedit the goal of full employment was of most importance to petty having recognised that labour was one of the major sources of wealth for individuals and the greatest wealth and strength of the kingdom in this vein he extended the clothwine argument above arguing that it is better to employ men and burn their product or to engage in extravagant public works projects than to have indolent supernumeraries in an economy – hence his famous example of relocating stonehenge across the plains of salisbury division of labouredit in his political arithmetick petty made a practical study of the division of labour showing its existence and usefulness in dutch shipyards classically the workers in a shipyard would build ships as units finishing one before starting another but the dutch had it organised with several teams each doing the same tasks for successive ships people with a particular task to do must have discovered new methods that were only later observed and justified by writers on political economy petty also applied the principle to his survey of ireland his breakthrough was to divide up the work so that large parts of it could be done by people with no extensive training urban societyedit petty projected the growth of the city of london and supposed that it might swallow the rest of england – not so far from what actually happened now if the city double its people in  years and the present number be  and if the whole territory be  and double in  years as aforesaid then by the underwritten table it appears that ad  the people of the city will be  and those of the whole country but  which is but inconsiderably more wherefore it is certain and necessary that the growth of the city must stop before the said year  and will be at its utmost height in the next preceding period ad  when the number of the city will be eight times its present number  and when besides the said number there will be  to perform the tillage pasturage and other rural works necessary to be done without the said city he imagined a future in which the city of london is seven times bigger than now and that the inhabitants of it are  people and that in all the other cities ports towns and villages there are but  more he expected this some time round  extrapolating existing trends long before malthus he noticed the potential of human population to increase but he also saw no reason why such a society should not be prosperous summary and legacyedit the above shows the contribution petty made to theoretical issues that have dominated the later subject of economics ever since he covered such a wide range of topics according to his political arithmetic method ie like modern economists he set out to prove his claims by finding data and statistics rather than relying on anecdotal evidence he wrote rigorously but also with concision and humour the issues that petty thought about and wrote are major topics that have plagued the minds of economic theorists ever since he influenced not only immediate successors such as richard cantillon but also some of the greatest minds in economics including adam smith karl marx and john maynard keynes with adam smith he shared a world view that believed in a harmonious natural world the parallels in their canons of taxation epitomise their joint belief in natural liberty and equality they both saw the benefits of specialisation and the division of labour furthermore smith and petty developed labour theories of value as did david ricardo henry george and karl marx in the th century smith said nothing about petty in the wealth of nations in his published writings there is nothing apart for a reference in a letter to lord shelburne one of pettys aristocratic descendants petty continued to exercise influence karl marx thought as did petty that the total effort put in by the aggregate of ordinary workers represented a far greater contribution to the economy than contemporary ideas recognised this belief led petty to conclude in his estimates that labour ranked as the greatest source of wealth in the kingdom by contrast marxs conclusions were that surplus labour was the source of all profit and that the labourer was alienated from his surplus and thus from society marxs high esteem of adam smith is mirrored in his consideration of pettys analysis as witnessed by countless quotations in his major work das kapital john maynard keynes also wrote at a time of mass discord as unemployment was rampant and economies stagnant during the s he showed how governments could manage aggregate demand to stimulate output and employment much as petty had done with

sank on the way back ireland and later lifeedit petty was knighted in  by charles ii and returned to ireland in  where he remained for most of the next twenty years the events that took him from oxford to ireland marked a shift from medicine and the physical sciences to the social sciences and petty lost all his oxford offices the social sciences became the area that he studied for the rest of his life his primary interest became irelands prosperity and his works describe that country and propose many remedies for its then backward condition he helped found the dublin society in  returning ultimately to london in  he died in  he regarded his life in bittersweet terms he had risen from humble origins to mix with the intellectual elite and was by  a considerably wealthy man and leading member of the progressive sciences nonetheless he was insecure about his land holdings and his ambitions of obtaining important political posts remained frustrated perhaps he expected the astronomical rise he experienced in his early years to continue throughout his life contemporaries described him nonetheless as humorous goodnatured and rational familyedit william petty married elizabeth waller in  she was a daughter of sir hardress waller she had been married with sir maurice fenton who died  she was given the title baroness shelburne for life they had three surviving children charles petty st baron shelburne henry petty st earl of shelburne anne who married thomas fitzmaurice st earl of kerry neither charles nor henry had male issue and the shelburne title passed to annes son john petty st earl of shelburne who took his mothers surname and whose descendants hold the title marquis of lansdowne her grandson william petty nd earl of shelburne praised her as a woman of strong character and intelligence the only person who could manage her badtempered and tyrannical husband economic works and theories overviewedit economic writings  before discussing pettys economic theories it is important to point out two crucial influences in his lifetone the first is thomas hobbes for whom petty acted as personal secretary according to hobbes theory should set out the rational requirements for civil peace and material plenty as hobbes had centred on peace petty chose prosperitycitation needed secondly the influence of francis bacon was profound bacon and indeed hobbes held the conviction that mathematics and the senses must be the basis of all rational sciences this passion for accuracy led petty to famously declare that his form of science would only use measurable phenomena and would seek quantitative precision rather than rely on comparatives or superlatives yielding a new subject that he named political arithmetic petty thus carved a niche for himself as the first dedicated economic scientist amidst the merchantpamphleteers such as thomas mun or josiah child and philosopherscientists occasionally discussing economics such as john locke he was indeed writing before the true development of political economy as such many of his claims for precision are of imperfect quality nonetheless petty wrote three main works on economics treatise of taxes and contributions written in  verbum sapienti  and quantulumcunque concerning money  all refreshingly conciseeditorializing these works which received great attention in the s show his theories on major areas of what would later become economics what follows is an analysis of his most important theories those on fiscal contributions national wealth the money supply and circulation velocity value the interest rate international trade and government investment fiscal contributionsedit fiscal contributions were of prime concern to policymakers in the th century as they have remained ever since for the wise country would not spend above its revenues by pettys time england was engaged in war with holland and in the first three chapters of treatise of taxes and contributions petty sought to establish principles of taxation and public expenditure to which the monarch could adhere when deciding how to raise money for the war petty lists six kinds of public charge namely defence governance the pastorage of mens souls education the maintenance of impotents of all sorts and infrastructure or things of universal good he then discusses general and particular causes of changes in these charges he thinks that there is great scope for reduction of the first four public charges and recommends increased spending on care for the elderly sick orphans etc as well as the government employment of supernumeraries on the issue of raising taxes petty was a definite proponent of consumption taxes he recommended that in general taxes should be just sufficient to meet the various types of public charges that he listed they should also be horizontally equitable regular and proportionate he condemned poll taxes as very unequal and excise on beer as taxing the poor excessively he recommended a much higher quality of statistical information to raise taxes more fairly imports should be taxed but only in such a way that would put them on a level playing field with domestic produce a vital aspect of economies at this time was that they were transforming from barter economies to money economies linked to this and aware of the scarcity of money petty recommends that taxes be payable in forms other than gold or silver which he estimated to be less than  of national wealth to him too much importance was placed on money which is to the whole effect of the kingdom… not even one to  national income accountingedit in making the above estimate petty introduced in the first two chapters of verbum sapienti the first rigorous assessments of national income and wealth to him it was all too obvious that a countrys wealth lay in more than just gold and silver he worked off an estimation that the average personal income was £ s d per annum with a population of six million meaning that national income would be £m pettys theory produced estimates some more reliable than others for the various components of national income including land ships personal estates and housing he then distinguished between the stocks £m and the flows yielding from them £m the discrepancy between these flows and his estimate for national income £m leads petty to postulate that the other £m is the yield from what must be £m of labour stock the value of the people this gave a total wealth for england in the s of £m statisticianedit sir william petty pettys only statistical technique is the use of simple averages he would not be a statistician by todays standards but during his time a statistician was merely one that employed the use of quantitative data because obtaining census data was difficult if not impossible especially for ireland he applied methods of estimation the way in which he would estimate the population would be to start with estimating the population of london he would do this by either estimating it by exports or by deaths his method of using exports is by considering that a  percent increase in exports corresponds to a similar proportionate increase in population the way he would use deaths would be by multiplying the number of deaths by  – estimating that one out of thirty people die each year to obtain the population of all of england he would multiply the population of london by  such a simple use of estimation could have easily have been abused and petty was accused more than once of doctoring the figures for the crown henry spiegel money supply and the velocity of its circulationedit this figure for the stock of wealth was contrasted with a money supply in gold and silver of only £m petty believed that there was a certain amount of money that a nation needed to drive its trade hence it was possible to have too little money circulating in an economy which would mean that people would have to rely on barter it would also be possible for there to be too much money in an economy but the topical question was as he asks in chapter  of verbum sapienti would £m be enough to drive a nations trade especially if the king wanted to raise additional funds for the war with holland the answer for petty lay in the velocity of moneys circulation anticipating the quantity theory of money often said to be initiated by john locke whereby yp  msv petty stated that if y was to be increased for a given money supply revolutions must occur in smaller circles ie higher va this could be done through the establishment of a bank he explicitly stated in verbum sapienti nor is money wanting to answer all the ends of a well policed state notwithstanding the great decreases thereof which have happened within these twenty years and that higher velocity is the answer he also mentions that there is nothing unique about gold and silver in fulfilling the functions of money and that money is the means to an end not the end itself nor were it hard to substitute in the place of money gold and silver were a comptency of it wanting what should be equivalent unto it for money is but the fat of the bodypolitick whereof too much doth often hinder its agility as too little makes it sick so doth money in the state quicken its action feeds from abroad in the time of dearth at home what is striking about these passages is his intellectual rigour which put him far ahead of the mercantilist writers of earlier in the century it is also interesting to note the use of biological analogies to illustrate his point a trend continued by the physiocrats in france early in the th century theory of valueedit on value petty continued the debate begun by aristotle and chose to develop an inputbased theory of value all things ought to be valued by two natural denominations which is land and labour p  both of these would be prime sources of taxable income like richard cantillon after him he sought to devise some equation or par between the mother and father of output land and labour and to express value accordingly he still included general productivity ones art and industry he applied his theory of value to rent the natural rent of a land was the excess of what a labourer produces on it in a year over what he ate himself and traded for necessities it was therefore the profit above the various costs related to the factors involved in production the interest rateedit the natural rate of rent is related to his theories on usury at the time many religious writers still condemned the charging of interest as sinful petty also involved himself in the debate on usury and interest rates regarding the phenomenon as a reward for forbearance on the part of the lender incorporating his theories of value he asserted that with perfect security the rate of interest should equal the rent for land that the principal could have bought – again a precocious insight into what would later become general equilibrium findings where security was more casual the return should be greater – a return for risk having established the justification for usury itself that of forbearance he then shows his hobbesian qualities arguing against any government regulation of the interest rate pointing to the vanity and fruitlessness of making civil positive laws against the laws of nature laissezfaire governanceedit this is one of the major themes of pettys writings summed up by his use of the phrase vadere sicut vult whence we get laissezfaire as mentioned earlier the motif of medicine was also useful to petty and he warned against overinterference by the government in the economy seeing it as analogous to a physician tampering excessively with his patient he applied this to monopolies controls on the exportation of money and on the trade of commodities they were to him vain and harmful to a nation he recognised the price effects of monopolies citing the french kings salt monopoly as an example in another work political arithmetic petty also recognised the importance of economies of scale he described the phenomenon of the division of labour asserting that a good is both of better quality and cheaper if many work on it petty said that the gain is greater as the manufacture itself is greater foreign exchange and control of tradeedit on the efflux of specie petty thought it vain to try to control it and dangerous as it would leave the merchants to decide what goods a nation buys with the smaller amount of money he noted in quantulumcunque concerning money that countries plentiful in gold have no such laws restricting specie on exports in general he regarded prescriptions such as recent acts of parliament forbidding the export of wool and yarn as burthensome further restrictions would do us twice as much harm as the losse of our said trade p  albeit with a concession that he is no expert in the study of the wool trade on prohibiting imports for example from holland such restrictions did little other than drive up prices and were only useful if imports vastly exceeded exports petty saw far more use in going to holland and learning whatever skills they have than trying to resist nature epitomizing his viewpoint he thought it preferable to sell cloth for debauching foreign wines rather than leave the clothiers unemployed full employmentedit the goal of full employment was of most importance to petty having recognised that labour was one of the major sources of wealth for individuals and the greatest wealth and strength of the kingdom in this vein he extended the clothwine argument above arguing that it is better to employ men and burn their product or to engage in extravagant public works projects than to have indolent supernumeraries in an economy – hence his famous example of relocating stonehenge across the plains of salisbury division of labouredit in his political arithmetick petty made a practical study of the division of labour showing its existence and usefulness in dutch shipyards classically the workers in a shipyard would build ships as units finishing one before starting another but the dutch had it organised with several teams each doing the same tasks for successive ships people with a particular task to do must have discovered new methods that were only later observed and justified by writers on political economy petty also applied the principle to his survey of ireland his breakthrough was to divide up the work so that large parts of it could be done by people with no extensive training urban societyedit petty projected the growth of the city of london and supposed that it might swallow the rest of england – not so far from what actually happened now if the city double its people in  years and the present number be  and if the whole territory be  and double in  years as aforesaid then by the underwritten table it appears that ad  the people of the city will be  and those of the whole country but  which is but inconsiderably more wherefore it is certain and necessary that the growth of the city must stop before the said year  and will be at its utmost height in the next preceding period ad  when the number of the city will be eight times its present number  and when besides the said number there will be  to perform the tillage pasturage and other rural works necessary to be done without the said city he imagined a future in which the city of london is seven times bigger than now and that the inhabitants of it are  people and that in all the other cities ports towns and villages there are but  more he expected this some time round  extrapolating existing trends long before malthus he noticed the potential of human population to increase but he also saw no reason why such a society should not be prosperous summary and legacyedit the above shows the contribution petty made to theoretical issues that have dominated the later subject of economics ever since he covered such a wide range of topics according to his political arithmetic method ie like modern economists he set out to prove his claims by finding data and statistics rather than relying on anecdotal evidence he wrote rigorously but also with concision and humour the issues that petty thought about and wrote are major topics that have plagued the minds of economic theorists ever since he influenced not only immediate successors such as richard cantillon but also some of the greatest minds in economics including adam smith karl marx and john maynard keynes with adam smith he shared a world view that believed in a harmonious natural world the parallels in their canons of taxation epitomise their joint belief in natural liberty and equality they both saw the benefits of specialisation and the division of labour furthermore smith and petty developed labour theories of value as did david ricardo henry george and karl marx in the th century smith said nothing about petty in the wealth of nations in his published writings there is nothing apart for a reference in a letter to lord shelburne one of pettys aristocratic descendants petty continued to exercise influence karl marx thought as did petty that the total effort put in by the aggregate of ordinary workers represented a far greater contribution to the economy than contemporary ideas recognised this belief led petty to conclude in his estimates that labour ranked as the greatest source of wealth in the kingdom by contrast marxs conclusions were that surplus labour was the source of all profit and that the labourer was alienated from his surplus and thus from society marxs high esteem of adam smith is mirrored in his consideration of pettys analysis as witnessed by countless quotations in his major work das kapital john maynard keynes also wrote at a time of mass discord as unemployment was rampant and economies stagnant during the s he showed how governments could manage aggregate demand to stimulate output and employment much as petty had done with

grain planter proposed attaching engines to boats and patented a “doublewriting” instrument it produced an extra copy of whatever a writer put down on paper petty who died at christmas in  was also an innovator in the world of theories by tinkering with data and simple models this littleknown englishman came up with many of the ideas—how to measure gdp why the money supply and banks matter how lasting unemployment affects the economy—that form the bedrock of modern economicsborn in  the young petty showed an early interest in clockmaking and joinery but did not enter either trade his hometown romsey is close to the sea and he left home on a ship as a cabin boy aged  that brought the first of two mishaps that changed the course of his life after breaking his leg in a nautical accident he was put ashore for treatment in normandy as the injury healed he enrolled in a jesuit college in caen and developed an interest in anatomy which he went on to study in amsterdam and paris

then came the second upheaval after witnessing a bungled hanging petty appeared to bring the criminal a woman back to life she was pardoned his reputation soared and he received a lucrative post as physician general in ireland his travels explain why petty’s economics are full of international comparisons stagnant ireland more prosperous england and its great rival at the time the netherlandssuccess in ireland meant petty was granted an estate he puzzled over how to value it he first calculated its benefits if cattle grazing in a field put on a certain amount of weight each year the market price of the extra meat was a logical measure next he needed to work out how many years’ income to tally men cared about their children and grandchildren he reasoned but concerns for the future were finite using data on the extent to which generations overlapped petty reckoned  years was right he had jumped from a blank sheet of paper to an embryonic version of the “present value” calculation at the heart of modern financepetty’s landholding also provided the spur for his most important invention gdp england fought the dutch three times between  and  and landowners faced high taxes petty thought this unjust and to explain why he set out the first set of national accounts for england and wales first he asserted that total income must equal total spending since  pence a day was needed for food housing clothing and “all other necessities” and the population was m spending was £m a year next he tallied the income from a long list of assets—land houses in london ships—for a sum of £m if £m of the £m in spending was income from assets the remaining £m must be wages the tax burden he argued should be shifted accordinglyother ideas were less selfserving out of concern that high interest rates were holding back trade in ireland petty developed a sophisticated monetary theory according to james ullmer of western carolina university he calculated the cash needed for all the transactions in ireland each year and how quickly it circulated to derive an estimate of the amount of money needed to keep a lid on interest rates this “quantity theory of money” is core to monetary economics and petty’s version of it came a century before the one published by david hume in  that is usually credited as the first proper treatmentpetty’s monetary theories prompted him to contest criticism of england’s fledgling banking system take he argued the problem of an economy that needs a money supply of £ but has only £ in cash it could keep £ as currency with £ put into banks because banks could lend the money out loans and deposits would run close to £ add back the coins and you have £ since such “fractional reserve” banking could help multiply money petty was a supporter banks could help england compete with the dutchpyramid schemerpetty also drew conclusions from his national accounts which pointed to the importance of income from labour he worried that unemployment would reduce men’s facility to work—precisely the jobmarket scarring or “hysteresis” modern economists fret about he preempted a rhetorical proposal made centuries later by john maynard keynes since pointless work was better than none the unemployed could be paid to build a pyramid on salisbury plains or transport stonehenge to london petty’s real point was that deficient demand was a threat and that in times of slump public investment could help offset itvarious hues of academic snobbery explain why petty is little known that he included data with everything he wrote put him at risk later studies found different results in the century after his death his datafirst approach fell out of favour it seemed purer to construct theories first then test them against data worse petty did not seek an allencompassing theory of the world because he lacked a model that joined up all markets he was labelled an “anticipator” but not a founder of economicstoday these complaints seem flimsy the economists toiling in central banks have ditched their overarching models and now run lots of little ones at firms like google and ebay data mining is no longer a sin but a lucrative skill petty’s
