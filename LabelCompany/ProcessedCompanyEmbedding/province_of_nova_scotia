operations team at the province of nova scotia decided to implement gitlab for source control and cicd heres how we started exploring devops join our devops webcast live in  the unix operations team at the province of nova scotia decided to implement gitlab for source control and continuous integration and continuous deployment this was the beginning of our foray into devops practices this article describes our automated testing integration and release of puppet code source control a source control management scm system allows the user to “commit” code documentation and other system artifacts such as configuration files to a central location each change results in a new version of the file and previous versions of the file remain available on the scm restoring a previous version is quick and easy we needed a way for multiple sysadmins to be able to work on code without colliding with one another we also needed a way to vet changes through a peer review process gitlab makes this easy thanks to its support of branching and merge requests branching allows a sysadmin to create an individual copy of the production code “master” and work with it in isolation — this allows multiple team members to be working on the same production code base without being concerned about conflicts between their work continuous integration as we built out more of our infrastructure with puppet we needed an automated way of testing our code over time our test strategy has evolved to include automated syntax checking linting unit and integration tests manual testing was not sufficient as it was often forgotten about and was very time consuming automated testing solved that — for every code commit the test pipeline is executed a complete test cycle currently takes under five minutes on each code commit to a branch other than master the following test pipeline is kicked off by gitlab ci if at any point a job fails the pipeline stops and the sysadmin is notified one of the great features of gitlab ci is its tight integration with docker — each of the jobs above is run inside its own isolated container the syntaxlintspec job verifies that the puppet syntax is good linting confirms the code conforms to best practices and spec confirms that logically the code functions as designed the testkitchen jobs are a full suite of serverspec tests we automatically provision four containers that represent our four most common configurations our puppet code is applied to each container to verify that it will work in our production environment this acts as a full regression test each time a code commit is made and ensures that there were no unintended problems introduced it gives us confidence that the code is actually doing what it’s intended to do continuous deployment once all of the tests pass the sysadmin can submit a merge request for their branch and it will be reviewed by a senior staff member before reaching production this is an important part of our workflow because it gives junior staff the confidence that a more senior member of the team will review and approve a change before it reaches any of our servers if the merge request is accepted the branch will be merged into master and at that point gitlab ci will push the code to our red hat satellite and puppet enterprise servers where it will be deployed to our environment you can find the configuration files dockerfiles kitchenyml gitlabciyml and satellite push script at our github the implementation of our system automation strategy and the toolset we selected has proven itself many times we are spending less time fighting fires due to the streamlined and tested nature of our deployments and have earned the confidence of our clients the road ahead in upcoming articles we’ll write about the cicd process we built with communications nova scotia that allows their development team to deploy and roll back their dockerized application environment on demand we also plan to write about our automated test strategy for red hat ansible this post originally appeared on medium about the guest authors steve zinck spent most of his career working in the public service as a unix and infrastructure administrator over the past few years hes started to transition away from traditional systems administration and begun to focus on software delivery and automation as part of that transition his team has implemented gitlab at the core of our automation and software delivery stack his current focus is working with software and application teams to assist in streamlining their deployment and delivery process paul badcock started working in the it sector in  with positions in small startups to large fortune  companies to currently on a publicsector team his career was focused as a traditional it linux administrator until in the mids he started focusing on adopting development tooling practices and methodologies for operational teams this work culminated in implementing an early s devops workplace framework with the help of stewbawka and subsequently working with likeminded teams since as a part of adopting developer tools he has previously worked with

devops join our devops webcast live in  the unix operations team at the province of nova scotia decided to implement gitlab for source control and continuous integration and continuous deployment this was the beginning of our foray into devops practices this article describes our automated testing integration and release of puppet code source control a source control management scm system allows the user to “commit” code documentation and other system artifacts such as configuration files to a central location each change results in a new version of the file and previous versions of the file remain available on the scm restoring a previous version is quick and easy we needed a way for multiple sysadmins to be able to work on code without colliding with one another we also needed a way to vet changes through a peer review process gitlab makes this easy thanks to its support of branching and merge requests branching allows a sysadmin to create an individual copy of the production code “master” and work with it in isolation — this allows multiple team members to be working on the same production code base without being concerned about conflicts between their work continuous integration as we built out more of our infrastructure with puppet we needed an automated way of testing our code over time our test strategy has evolved to include automated syntax checking linting unit and integration tests manual testing was not sufficient as it was often forgotten about and was very time consuming automated testing solved that — for every code commit the test pipeline is executed a complete test cycle currently takes under five minutes on each code commit to a branch other than master the following test pipeline is kicked off by gitlab ci if at any point a job fails the pipeline stops and the sysadmin is notified one of the great features of gitlab ci is its tight integration with docker — each of the jobs above is run inside its own isolated container the syntaxlintspec job verifies that the puppet syntax is good linting confirms the code conforms to best practices and spec confirms that logically the code functions as designed the testkitchen jobs are a full suite of serverspec tests we automatically provision four containers that represent our four most common configurations our puppet code is applied to each container to verify that it will work in our production environment this acts as a full regression test each time a code commit is made and ensures that there were no unintended problems introduced it gives us confidence that the code is actually doing what it’s intended to do continuous deployment once all of the tests pass the sysadmin can submit a merge request for their branch and it will be reviewed by a senior staff member before reaching production this is an important part of our workflow because it gives junior staff the confidence that a more senior member of the team will review and approve a change before it reaches any of our servers if the merge request is accepted the branch will be merged into master and at that point gitlab ci will push the code to our red hat satellite and puppet enterprise servers where it will be deployed to our environment you can find the configuration files dockerfiles kitchenyml gitlabciyml and satellite push script at our github the implementation of our system automation strategy and the toolset we selected has proven itself many times we are spending less time fighting fires due to the streamlined and tested nature of our deployments and have earned the confidence of our clients the road ahead in upcoming articles we’ll write about the cicd process we built with communications nova scotia that allows their development team to deploy and roll back their dockerized application environment on demand we also plan to write about our automated test strategy for red hat ansible this post originally appeared on medium about the guest authors steve zinck spent most of his career working in the public service as a unix and infrastructure administrator over the past few years hes started to transition away from traditional systems administration and begun to focus on software delivery and automation as part of that transition his team has implemented gitlab at the core of our automation and software delivery stack his current focus is working with software and application teams to assist in streamlining their deployment and delivery process paul badcock started working in the it sector in  with positions in small startups to large fortune  companies to currently on a publicsector team his career was focused as a traditional it linux administrator until in the mids he started focusing on adopting development tooling practices and methodologies for operational teams this work culminated in implementing an early s devops workplace framework with the help of stewbawka and subsequently working with likeminded teams since as a part of adopting developer tools he has previously worked with and managed cvs svn installations and various vendor products before reading a “show hn” posting on hacker news about gitlab share on facebook share on

says new pilotproject results suggest roadside testing devices can be successfully used to detect drugimpaired drivingthe canadian pressdarryl dyck take our poll halifax – nova scotia’s landlords are looking for some assurances from the province ahead of canada’s legalization of marijuana the investment property owner’s association of nova scotia is asking the province to allow landlords the option to ban the smoking and growing of the drug in rental properties “this is actually all about the tenants” said the association’s kevin russell told global news “we’ve heard from tenants who have respiratory diseases tenants with young families seniors tenants who are nonsmokers “they’re expressing their concerns over the associated health risks with drifting secondhand marijuana smoke” russell said the association is asking the province to take multiunit dwellings into account when drafting regulations around legalization although the matter is a federal one provincial governments are responsible for a number of issues including where marijuana can be sold and in some cases where it can be consumed join the conversation cancel reply sign in to comment not connected to your
