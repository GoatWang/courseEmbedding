outmoded to win consumers attention and trust marketers must think less about what advertising says to its targets and more about what it does for them rather than conceive ad campaigns that hammer home a point they must think about advertising as well as the offerings it promotes  as a sustained and rewarding presence in consumers lives moving from engagement to a real marriage of brand and customer customers have more power than ever before in the history of economic life in this country or any country in the developed world because there is way too much product and not enough demand and not enough customers to go around we see an increadingly empowered customer this represents a dramatic shift that has been taking place over the past  years jeffreyrayporton twitter follow

some virtualare being created wich dramatically affect how business is being transacted and as a consequence where value will increasingly be created we call this a transition from the marketplace to the marketspace the transition is occurring at three levels of economic activity the first is products and services which will be reshaped to accommodate a marketspace whose salient characteristic is that it is informationbased the second level is marketing management systems the third level is the markets themselves affected as a consequence of the changes at the first two levels ultimately we believe the marketspace will supplant the marketplace for the simple reason that it will prove to be a more effective means of responding to customer needs and executing related transactions since we believe that it is inevitable our purpose here is to chart the territory and encourage managers to venture forth   more fewer audience level     kids general special   audience level  from  for best

that becomes the standard in a field of study the indispensable reference that every thoughtful practitioner must have on the shelf like samuelson in economics drucker in management and porter in strategy rayport and jaworski have written what leaders in the new economy are calling the standard in ecommerce strategy formulation  finally someone has put it all together these leading thinkers have put in one place a brilliant and comprehensive framework for thinking through planning teaching and managing ebusiness and beyond that this book is a portal to a stream of the most complete set of online video and other resources for ebusiness learning to date great insights powerful tools ralph oliva executive director of the institute for the study of business markets and professor of marketing pennsylvania state university  ecommerce is the first textbook to show how firms gain competitive advantage in the new economy the authors introduce a number of new and innovative concepts frameworks and tools that benefit both students and managers this book is destined to become the standard new economy text in leading mba programs john quelch dean london business school  this is a wonderfully designed pedagogical device the chapters build foundationally so as to empower the student to deal with unique new economy concepts like the dcf approach to valuation etc towards the end the chapters are filled with case vignettes viewpoints and thought bytes that draws the selfselected reader in and engages them in a sophisticated debate regarding the internet economy the highlight of the book for me was the way linkages were provided to existing management concepts thus the reader is not left wondering what the connection to the old paradigm is in fact the reader gets a working dose of those ideas in the book chapters this makes the book a standalone comprehensive text with a cuttingedge tone and content kastori rangan eliot i snider and family professor of business

frameworks and tools that benefit both students and managers this book is destined to become the standard new economy text in leading mba programs john quelch dean london business school this is a wonderfully designed pedagogical devicethe chapters build foundationally so as to empower the student to deal with unique new economy concepts like the dcf approach to valuation etc towards the end the chapters are filled with case vignettes viewpoints and thought bytes that draws the selfselected reader in and engages them in a sophisticated debate regarding the internet economy the highlight of the book for me was the way linkages were provided to existing management concepts thus the reader is not left wondering what the connection to the old paradigm is in fact the reader gets a working
