peter frampton les paul after paying his dues with humble pie and years of solo touring and recording in the late ’s and ’s young british guitar star peter frampton hit it huge in  with the release of frampton comes alive the biggest selling live album of all time and as every one of the more than  million fans who bought it in its first year of release alone could tell you you only needed to fold down that doublealbum cover to see frampton wailing on a black threepickup les paul custom players by the score ran out in search of their own version of that les paul custom the instrument in frampton’s hands widely assumed to be an original  model but its origins and its journey to the star’s hands and out of them once again reveal some unusual twists and turns during the first night of a threenight stand in  opening for the grateful dead at the fillmore west in san francisco while still playing with humble pie frampton was having trouble with howling feedback from his semihollowbody guitar on the big stage a fan named mark mariana approached him after his set on the second night said he’d noticed the hassles the guitarist was having and provided a solution if he wanted to frampton could play mariana’s solidbody les paul custom for the third night at the fillmore he delivered the instrument which looked for all the world like a  custom but was in fact a  custom freshly back from the gibson factory where it had been given a new coat of ebony black lacquer new frets and three humbucking pickups to update it to contemporary specs frampton bonded with the guitar instantly it not only cured his feedback problems for the closing night of the run it proved the most tuneful expressive guitar frampton had ever played when he offered to buy it after the set mariana said that no he wouldn’t sell it—he would give it to frampton and through that unprecedented act of generosity a reborn  les paul custom became one of the most iconic guitars of the decade sadly frampton’s original comes alive les paul custom was lost in  when a cargo plane crashed in venezuela but gibson’s custom shop raised it from the ashes in the form of the peter frampton les paul a
