didnt record gospel music any longer it was once rumored that phillips told cash to go home and sin then come back with a song i can sell although in a  interview cash denied that phillips made any such comment cash eventually won over the producer with new songs delivered in his early rockabilly style in  cash made his first recordings at sun hey porter and cry cry cry which were released in

released under the title million dollar quartet in cash the autobiography cash wrote that he was the one farthest from the microphone and was singing in a higher pitch to blend in with elvis cashs next record folsom prison blues made the country top  and i walk the line became no  on the country charts and entered the pop charts top  home of the blues followed recorded in july  that same year cash became the first sun artist to release a longplaying album although he was suns most consistently selling and prolific artist at that time cash felt constrained by his contract with the small label partly due to the fact that phillips wasnt keen on johnny recording gospel and he was getting only a  royalty as opposed to the standard rate of  presley had already left sun and phillips was focusing most of his attention and promotion on lewis the following year cash left the label to sign a lucrative offer with columbia records where his single dont take your guns to town became one of his biggest hits and his second album for columbia was a collection of gospel songs however cash left behind a sufficient backlog of recordings with sun that phillips continued to release new singles and even albums featuring previously unreleased material until as late as  placing cash in the unusual position of having new releases out on two labels concurrently with one  release a cover of oh lonesome me making as high as no  on the cw charts as opposed to when rca victor signed presley and also bought his sun records masters when cash departed for columbia phillips retained the rights to cashs sun masters columbia eventually licensed some of these recordings for release on compilations after cashs death the tennessee three with cash in  early in his career he was given the teasing nickname the undertaker by fellow artists because of his habit of wearing black clothes – though he did so only because they were easier to keep looking clean on long tours in the early s cash toured

seegers shortlived television series rainbow quest he also acted in and wrote and sang the opening theme for a  film entitled five minutes to live later rereleased as doortodoor maniac cashs career

spiraling out of control cashs frenetic creativity was still delivering hits his rendition of ring of fire was a crossover hit reaching no  on the country charts and entering the top  on the pop charts it was originally performed by junes sister but the signature mariachistyle horn arrangement was provided by cash who said that it had come to him in a dream vivian liberto claimed a different version of the origins of ring of fire in her book i walked the line my life with johnny liberto states that cash gave carter the credit for monetary reasons in june  his camper caught fire during a fishing trip with his nephew damon fielder in los padres national forest in california triggering a forest fire that burnt several hundred acres and nearly killed cash cash claimed that the fire was

outlaw image he never served a prison sentence despite landing in jail seven times for misdemeanors each stay lasted only a single night his most infamous runin with the law occurred while on tour in  when he was arrested october  by a narcotics squad in el paso texas the officers suspected he was smuggling heroin from mexico but found instead  dexedrine capsules amphetamines and  equanil sedatives or tranquilizers tablets that the singer had hidden inside his guitar case because the pills were prescription drugs rather than illegal narcotics he received a suspended sentence johnny cash and his second wife june carter cash had also been arrested on may   in starkville mississippi for trespassing late at night onto private property to pick flowers this incident gave the spark for the song

record mixing authentic frontier songs with cashs spoken narration and bitter tears  with songs highlighting the plight of the native americans his drug addiction was at its worst at this point and

experience for saving his life and he later came back to lafayette to play a benefit concert that attracted  people the city population was less than  at the time and raised  for the high school reflecting on his past in a  interview cash noted i was taking the pills for awhile and then the pills started taking me cash curtailed his use of drugs for several years in  after a spiritual epiphany in the nickajack cave when he attempted to commit suicide while under the heavy influence of drugs he descended deeper into the cave trying to lose himself and just die when he passed out on the floor he reported being exhausted and feeling at the end of his rope when he felt gods presence in his heart and managed to struggle out of the cave despite the exhaustion by following a faint light and slight breeze to him it was his own rebirth june maybelle and ezra carter moved into cashs mansion for a month to help him conquer his addiction cash proposed onstage to june at a concert at the london gardens in london ontario canada on february   the couple married a week later on march  in franklin kentucky she had agreed to marry cash after he had cleaned up he rediscovered his christian faith taking an altar call in evangel temple a small church in the nashville area pastored by reverend jimmie rodgers snow son of country music legend hank snow according to longtime friend marshall grant cashs  rebirth experience did not result in his completely stopping use of amphetamines however beginning in  cash ended all drug use for a period of seven years grant claims that the birth of cashs son john carter cash inspired cash to end his dependence cash began using amphetamines again in  by  he was once again addicted and entered the betty ford clinic in rancho mirage california for rehabilitation cash managed to stay off drugs for several years but by  he was dependent again and entered nashvilles cumberland heights alcohol and drug treatment center in  he entered

concertsedit cash began performing concerts at prisons starting in the late s he played his first famous prison concert on january   at san quentin state prison these performances led to a pair of highly successful live albums johnny cash at folsom prison  and johnny cash at san quentin  both live albums reached number  on billboard country album music and the latter crossed over to reach the top of the billboard pop album chart in  cash became an international hit when he eclipsed even the beatles by selling  million albums in comparison the prison concerts were much more successful than his later live albums such as strawberry cake recorded in london and live at madison square garden which peaked at  and  on the album charts respectively the folsom prison record was introduced by a rendition of his folsom prison blues while the san quentin record included the crossover hit single a boy named sue a shel silversteinpenned novelty song that reached no  on the country charts and no  on the us top ten pop charts the am versions of the latter contained profanities which were edited out the modern cd versions are unedited and thus also longer than the original vinyl albums though they retain the audience reaction overdubs of the originals cash performed at the österåker prison in sweden in  the live album på österåker at österåker was released in  san quentin was recorded with cash replacing san quentin with österåker in  a further prison concert this time at tennessee prison was videotaped for tv broadcast and received a belated cd release after cashs death as a concert behind prison walls activism for native americansedit in  cash and june carter appeared on pete seegers tv show rainbow quest on which cash explained his start as an activist for native americans in  i wrote a song called old apache squaw and then forgot the socalled indian protest for a while but nobody else seemed to speak up with any volume of voice columbia the label for which cash was recording then was opposed to putting the song on his next album considering it too radical for the public cash singing songs of indian tragedy and settler violence went radically against the mainstream of country music in the s which was dominated by the image of the righteous cowboy who simply makes the natives soil his own in  coming off the chart success that his previous album i walk the line had been he recorded the aforementioned album bitter tears ballads of the american indian the album featured stories of a multitude of native peoples mostly of their violent oppression by white settlers the pima the ballad of ira hayes navajo navajo apache apache tears lakota big foot seneca as long as the grass shall grow and cherokee talking leaves cash wrote three of the songs himself and one with the help of johnny horton but the majority of the protest songs were written by folk artist peter la farge son of activist and pulitzer prizewinner oliver la farge whom cash met in new york in the s and whom he admired for his activism the albums single the ballad of ira hayes was neglected by nonpolitical radio at the time and the record label denied it any promotion due to its provocative protesting and thus unappealing nature cash faced resistance and was even urged by an editor of a country music magazine to leave the country music association you and your crowd are just too intelligent to associate with plain country folks country artists and country djs in reaction on august   the singer posted a letter as an advertisement in billboard magazine calling the record industry cowardly djs – station managers – owners  where are your guts he demands i had to fight back when i realized that so many stations are afraid of ira hayes just one question why he concludes the letter ira hayes is strong medicine  so is rochester harlem birmingham and vietnam  cash kept promoting the song himself and used his influence on radio disc jockeys he knew eventually to make the song climb to number three on the country charts while the album rose to number two on the album charts cash in  later on the johnny cash show he continued telling stories of nativeamerican plight both in song and through short films such as the history of the trail of tears in  in response to his activism the singer was adopted by the seneca nations turtle clan he performed benefits in  at the rosebud reservation close to the historical landmark of the massacre at wounded knee to raise money to help build a school he also played at the dq university in the s in

a major career boost from the johnny cash show was kris kristofferson who was beginning to make a name for himself as a singersongwriter during a live performance of kristoffersons sunday mornin comin down cash refused to change the lyrics to suit network executives singing the song with its references to marijuana intact on a sunday morning sidewalk im wishin lord that i was stoned by the early s he had crystallized his public image as the man in black he regularly performed dressed all in black wearing a long black kneelength coat this outfit stood in contrast to the costumes worn by most of the major country acts in his day rhinestone suits and cowboy boots in  cash wrote the song man in black to help explain his dress code were doing mighty fine i do suppose in our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes but just so were reminded of the ones who are held back up front there ought to be a man in black cash performing in bremen west germany in september  he wore black on behalf of the poor and hungry on behalf of the prisoner who has long paid for his crime and on behalf of those who have been betrayed by age or drugs and cash added with the vietnam war as painful in my mind as it was in most other americans i wore it in mournin for the lives that could have been  apart from the vietnam war being over i dont see much reason to change my position  the old are still neglected the poor are still poor the young are still dying before their time and were not making many moves to make things right theres still plenty of darkness to carry off cash in the one piece at a time

to memphis tennessee where he sold appliances while studying to be a radio announcer at night he played with guitarist luther perkins and bassist marshall grant perkins and grant were known as the tennessee two cash worked up the courage to visit the sun records studio hoping to get a recording contract after auditioning for sam phillips singing mostly gospel songs phillips told him that he didnt record gospel music any longer it was once rumored that phillips told cash to go home and sin then come back with a song i can sell although in a  interview cash denied that phillips made any such comment cash eventually won over the producer with new songs delivered in his early rockabilly style in  cash made his first recordings at sun hey porter and cry cry cry which were released in late june and met with success on the country hit parade on december   elvis presley dropped in on phillips while carl perkins was in the studio cutting new tracks with jerry lee lewis backing him on piano cash was also in the studio and the four started an impromptu jam session phillips left the tapes running and the recordings almost half of which were gospel songs survived and have since been released under the title million dollar quartet in cash the autobiography cash wrote that he was the one farthest from the microphone and was singing in a higher pitch to blend in with elvis cashs next record folsom prison blues made the country top  and i walk the line became no  on the country charts and entered the pop charts top  home of the blues followed recorded in july  that same year cash became the first sun artist to release a longplaying album although he was suns most consistently selling and prolific artist at that time cash felt constrained by his contract with the small label partly due to the fact that phillips wasnt keen on johnny recording gospel and he was getting only a  royalty as opposed to the standard rate of  presley had already left sun and phillips was focusing most of his attention and promotion on lewis the following year cash left the label to sign a lucrative offer with columbia records where his single dont take your guns to town became one of his biggest hits and his second album for columbia was a collection of gospel songs however cash left behind a sufficient backlog of recordings with sun that phillips continued to release new singles and even albums featuring previously unreleased material until as late as  placing cash in the unusual position of having new releases out on two labels concurrently with one  release a cover of oh lonesome me making as high as no  on the cw charts as opposed to when rca victor signed presley and also bought his sun records masters when cash departed for columbia phillips retained the rights to cashs sun masters columbia eventually licensed some of these recordings for release on compilations after cashs death the tennessee three with cash in  early in his career he was given the teasing nickname the undertaker by fellow artists because of his habit of wearing black clothes – though he did so only because they were easier to keep looking clean on long tours in the early s cash toured with the carter family which by this time regularly included mother maybelles daughters anita june and helen june later recalled admiring him from afar during these tours in the s he appeared on pete seegers shortlived television series rainbow quest he also acted in and wrote and sang the opening theme for a  film entitled five minutes to live later rereleased as doortodoor maniac cashs career was handled by saul holiff a london ontario promoter and this relationship was the subject of sauls sons biopic my father and the man in black outlaw imageedit as his career was taking off in the late s cash started drinking heavily and became addicted to amphetamines and barbiturates for a brief time he shared an apartment in nashville with waylon jennings who was heavily addicted to amphetamines cash used the uppers to stay awake during tours friends joked about his nervousness and erratic behavior many ignoring the warning signs of his worsening drug addiction although he was in many ways spiraling out of control cashs frenetic creativity was still delivering hits his rendition of ring of fire was a crossover hit reaching no  on the country charts and entering the top  on the pop charts it was originally performed by junes sister but the signature mariachistyle horn arrangement was provided by cash who said that it had come to him in a dream vivian liberto claimed a different version of the origins of ring of fire in her book i walked the line my life with johnny liberto states that cash gave carter the credit for monetary reasons in june  his camper caught fire during a fishing trip with his nephew damon fielder in los padres national forest in california triggering a forest fire that burnt several hundred acres and nearly killed cash cash claimed that the fire was caused by sparks from a defective exhaust system on his camper but fielder thinks that cash started a fire to stay warm and in his drugged condition failed to notice the fire getting out of controlpage needed when the judge asked cash why he did it cash said i didnt do it my truck did and its dead so you cant question itpage needed the fire destroyed  acres  ha burning the foliage off three mountains and driving off fortynine of the refuges  endangered condors cash was unrepentant and claimed i dont care about your damn yellow buzzards the federal government sued him and was awarded  cash eventually settled the case and paid  he said he was the only person ever sued by the government for starting a forest firepage needed although cash carefully cultivated a romantic outlaw image he never served a prison sentence despite landing in jail seven times for misdemeanors each stay lasted only a single night his most infamous runin with the law occurred while on tour in  when he was arrested october  by a narcotics squad in el paso texas the officers suspected he was smuggling heroin from mexico but found instead  dexedrine capsules amphetamines and  equanil sedatives or tranquilizers tablets that the singer had hidden inside his guitar case because the pills were prescription drugs rather than illegal narcotics he received a suspended sentence johnny cash and his second wife june carter cash had also been arrested on may   in starkville mississippi for trespassing late at night onto private property to pick flowers this incident gave the spark for the song starkville city jail which he discussed on his live at san quentin album in the mids cash released a number of concept albums including sings the ballads of the true west  an experimental double record mixing authentic frontier songs with cashs spoken narration and bitter tears  with songs highlighting the plight of the native americans his drug addiction was at its worst at this point and his destructive behavior led to a divorce from his first wife and canceled performances nonetheless he continued to find success and in  cashs duet with june carter jackson won a grammy award cashs final arrest was in  in walker county georgia after being involved in a car accident while carrying a bag of prescription pills cash attempted to bribe a local deputy who turned the money down cash then spent the night in a lafayette georgia jail the singer was released after a long talk with sheriff ralph jones who warned him of his dangerous behavior and wasted potential cash credited that experience for saving his life and he later came back to lafayette to play a benefit concert that attracted  people the city population was less than  at the time and raised  for the high school reflecting on his past in a  interview cash noted i was taking the pills for awhile and then the pills started taking me cash curtailed his use of drugs for several years in  after a spiritual epiphany in the nickajack cave when he attempted to commit suicide while under the heavy influence of drugs he descended deeper into the cave trying to lose himself and just die when he passed out on the floor he reported being exhausted and feeling at the end of his rope when he felt gods presence in his heart and managed to struggle out of the cave despite the exhaustion by following a faint light and slight breeze to him it was his own rebirth june maybelle and ezra carter moved into cashs mansion for a month to help him conquer his addiction cash proposed onstage to june at a concert at the london gardens in london ontario canada on february   the couple married a week later on march  in franklin kentucky she had agreed to marry cash after he had cleaned up he rediscovered his christian faith taking an altar call in evangel temple a small church in the nashville area pastored by reverend jimmie rodgers snow son of country music legend hank snow according to longtime friend marshall grant cashs  rebirth experience did not result in his completely stopping use of amphetamines however beginning in  cash ended all drug use for a period of seven years grant claims that the birth of cashs son john carter cash inspired cash to end his dependence cash began using amphetamines again in  by  he was once again addicted and entered the betty ford clinic in rancho mirage california for rehabilitation cash managed to stay off drugs for several years but by  he was dependent again and entered nashvilles cumberland heights alcohol and drug treatment center in  he entered

concertsedit cash began performing concerts at prisons starting in the late s he played his first famous prison concert on january   at san quentin state prison these performances led to a pair of highly successful live albums johnny cash at folsom prison  and johnny cash at san quentin  both live albums reached number  on billboard country album music and the latter crossed over to reach the top of the billboard pop album chart in  cash became an international hit when he eclipsed even the beatles by selling  million albums in comparison the prison concerts were much more successful than his later live albums such as strawberry cake recorded in london and live at madison square garden which peaked at  and  on the album charts respectively the folsom prison record was introduced by a rendition of his folsom prison blues while the san quentin record included the crossover hit single a boy named sue a shel silversteinpenned novelty song that reached no  on the country charts and no  on the us top ten pop charts the am versions of the latter contained profanities which were edited out the modern cd versions are unedited and thus also longer than the original vinyl albums though they retain the audience reaction overdubs of the originals cash performed at the österåker prison in sweden in  the live album på österåker at österåker was released in  san quentin was recorded with cash replacing san quentin with österåker in  a further prison concert this time at tennessee prison was videotaped for tv broadcast and received a belated cd release after cashs death as a concert behind prison walls activism for native americansedit in  cash and june carter appeared on pete seegers tv show rainbow quest on which cash explained his start as an activist for native americans in  i wrote a song called old apache squaw and then forgot the socalled indian protest for a while but nobody else seemed to speak up with any volume of voice columbia the label for which cash was

to memphis tennessee where he sold appliances while studying to be a radio announcer at night he played with guitarist luther perkins and bassist marshall grant perkins and grant were known as the tennessee two cash worked up the courage to visit the sun records studio hoping to get a recording contract after auditioning for sam phillips singing mostly gospel songs phillips told him that he didnt record gospel music any longer it was once rumored that phillips told cash to go home and sin then come back with a song i can sell although in a  interview cash denied that phillips made any such comment cash eventually won over the producer with new songs delivered in his early rockabilly style in  cash made his first recordings at sun hey porter and cry cry cry which were released in late june and met with success on the country hit parade on december   elvis presley dropped in on phillips while carl perkins was in the studio cutting new tracks with jerry lee lewis backing him on piano cash was also in the studio and the four started an impromptu jam session phillips left the tapes running and the recordings almost half of which were gospel songs survived and have since been released under the title million dollar quartet in cash the autobiography cash wrote that he was the one farthest from the microphone and was singing in a higher pitch to blend in with elvis cashs next record folsom prison blues made the country top  and i walk the line became no  on the country charts and entered the pop charts top  home of the blues followed recorded in july  that same year cash became the first sun artist to release a longplaying album although he was suns most consistently selling and prolific artist at that time cash felt constrained by his contract with the small label partly due to the fact that phillips wasnt keen on johnny recording gospel and he was getting only a  royalty as opposed to the standard rate of  presley had already left sun and phillips was focusing most of his attention and promotion on lewis the following year cash left the label to sign a lucrative offer with columbia records where his single dont take your guns to town became one of his biggest hits and his second album for columbia was a collection of gospel songs however cash left behind a sufficient backlog of recordings with sun that phillips continued to release new singles and even albums featuring previously unreleased material until as late as  placing cash in the unusual position of having new releases out on two labels concurrently with one  release a cover of oh lonesome me making as high as no  on the cw charts as opposed to when rca victor signed presley and also bought his sun records masters when cash departed for columbia phillips retained the rights to cashs sun masters columbia eventually licensed some of these recordings for release on compilations after cashs death the tennessee three with cash in  early in his career he was given the teasing nickname the undertaker by fellow artists because of his habit of wearing black clothes – though he did so only because they were easier to keep looking clean on long tours in the early s cash toured with the carter family which by this time regularly included mother maybelles daughters anita june and helen june later recalled admiring him from afar during these tours in the s he appeared on pete seegers shortlived television series rainbow quest he also acted in and wrote and sang the opening theme for a  film entitled five minutes to live later rereleased as doortodoor maniac cashs career was handled by saul holiff a london ontario promoter and this relationship was the subject of sauls sons biopic my father and the man in black outlaw imageedit as his career was taking off in the late s cash started drinking heavily and became addicted to amphetamines and barbiturates for a brief time he shared an apartment in nashville with waylon jennings who was heavily addicted to amphetamines cash used the uppers to stay awake during tours friends joked about his nervousness and erratic behavior many ignoring the warning signs of his worsening drug addiction although he was in many ways spiraling out of control cashs frenetic creativity was still delivering hits his rendition of ring of fire was a crossover hit reaching no  on the country charts and entering the top  on the pop charts it was originally performed by junes sister but the signature mariachistyle horn arrangement was provided by cash who said that it had come to him in a dream vivian liberto claimed a different version of the origins of ring of fire in her book i walked the line my life with johnny liberto states that cash gave carter the credit for monetary reasons in june  his camper caught fire during a fishing trip with his nephew damon fielder in los padres national forest in california triggering a forest fire that burnt several hundred acres and nearly killed cash cash claimed that the fire was caused by sparks from a defective exhaust system on his camper but fielder thinks that cash started a fire to stay warm and in his drugged condition failed to notice the fire getting out of controlpage needed when the judge asked cash why he did it cash said i didnt do it my truck did and its dead so you cant question itpage needed the fire destroyed  acres  ha burning the foliage off three mountains and driving off fortynine of the refuges  endangered condors cash was unrepentant and claimed i dont care about your damn yellow buzzards the federal government sued him and was awarded  cash eventually settled the case and paid  he said he was the only person ever sued by the government for starting a forest firepage needed although cash carefully cultivated a romantic outlaw image he never served a prison sentence despite landing in jail seven times for misdemeanors each stay lasted only a single night his most infamous runin with the law occurred while on tour in

i wrote a song called old apache squaw and then forgot the socalled indian protest for a while but nobody else seemed to speak up with any volume of voice columbia the label for which cash was recording then was opposed to putting the song on his next album considering it too radical for the public cash singing songs of indian tragedy and settler violence went radically against the

in new york in the s and whom he admired for his activism the albums single the ballad of ira hayes was neglected by nonpolitical radio at the time and the record label denied it any promotion due to its provocative protesting and thus unappealing nature cash faced resistance and was even urged by an editor of a country music magazine to leave the country music association you and your crowd are just too intelligent to associate with plain country folks country artists and country djs in reaction on august   the singer posted a letter as an advertisement in billboard magazine calling the record industry cowardly djs – station managers – owners  where are your guts he demands i had to fight back when i realized that so many stations are afraid of ira hayes just one question why he

type endured over the years his timbre changed noticeably through a recording career that stretched back to  pareles writes cashs bassbaritone voice went from gravelly to grave  for cash black stage attire was a symbol of rebellion—against a stagnant status quo against  hypocritical houses of god against people whose minds are closed to others ideas  schultz refers to this phrase as cashs trademark greeting and places his utterance of this line on cashs at folsom prison album among the most electrifying seconds in the history of concert recording  other appraisals of cashs iconic value have been even bolder  urbanski notes that cashs habit of performing in black attire began in a church in the following paragraph he quotes cash as indicating that this habit was partially reflective of cashs rebellion against our hypocritical houses of god  according to urbanski cashs selfperception was accurate he never intended to be categorized or pigeonholed and indeed he amassed a cluster of enigmas which was so impenetrably deep that even those closest to him never got to see every part of him referencesedit  johnny cash—guitars and equipment über pro audio  retrieved may     a b johnny

recording then was opposed to putting the song on his next album considering it too radical for the public cash singing songs of indian tragedy and settler violence went radically against the

in new york in the s and whom he admired for his activism the albums single the ballad of ira hayes was neglected by nonpolitical radio at the time and the record label denied it any promotion due to its provocative protesting and thus unappealing nature cash faced resistance and was even urged by an editor of a country music magazine to leave the country music association you and your crowd are just too intelligent to associate with plain country folks country artists and country djs in reaction on august   the singer posted a letter as an advertisement in billboard magazine calling the record industry cowardly djs – station managers – owners  where are your guts he demands i had to fight back when i realized that so many stations are afraid of ira hayes just one question why he

have been even bolder  urbanski notes that cashs habit of performing in black attire began in a church in the following paragraph he quotes cash as indicating that this habit was partially reflective of cashs rebellion against our hypocritical houses of god  according to urbanski cashs selfperception was accurate he never intended to be categorized or pigeonholed and indeed he amassed a cluster of enigmas which was so impenetrably deep that even those closest to him never got to see every part of him referencesedit  johnny cash—guitars and equipment über pro audio  retrieved may     a b johnny

i wrote a song called old apache squaw and then forgot the socalled indian protest for a while but nobody else seemed to speak up with any volume of voice columbia the label for which cash was recording then was opposed to putting the song on his next album considering it too radical for the public cash singing songs of indian tragedy and settler violence went radically against the mainstream of country music in the s which was dominated by the image of the righteous cowboy who simply makes the natives soil his own in  coming off the chart success that his previous album i walk the line had been he recorded the aforementioned album bitter tears ballads of the american indian the album featured stories of a multitude of native peoples mostly of their violent oppression by white settlers the pima the ballad of ira hayes navajo navajo apache apache tears lakota big foot seneca as long as the grass shall grow and cherokee talking leaves cash wrote three of the songs

in new york in the s and whom he admired for his activism the albums single the ballad of ira hayes was neglected by nonpolitical radio at the time and the record label denied it any promotion due to its provocative protesting and thus unappealing nature cash faced resistance and was even urged by an editor of a country music magazine to leave the country music association you and your crowd are just too intelligent to associate with plain country folks country artists and country djs in reaction on august   the singer posted a letter as an advertisement in billboard magazine calling the record industry cowardly djs – station managers – owners  where are your guts he demands i had to fight back when i realized that so many stations are afraid of ira hayes just one question why he concludes the letter ira hayes is strong medicine  so is rochester harlem birmingham and vietnam  cash kept promoting the song himself and used his influence on radio disc jockeys he knew eventually to make the song climb to number three on the country charts while the album rose to number two on the album charts cash in  later on the johnny cash show he continued telling stories of

cars and fancy clothes but just so were reminded of the ones who are held back up front there ought to be a man in black cash performing in bremen west germany in september  he wore black on behalf of

info shipping info originals every original painting comes ready to hang upon delivery each original painting also comes with a certificate of authenticity coa that is both signed wax sealed and thumb printed by me to ensure the paintings provenance as always and in addition to the coa every painting is documented and recorded with photographs andor scanning every painting of mine comes signed with my symbol i am often asked why i use a symbol instead of signing my name from the very first painting i ever created i chose to use this symbol for a couple of reasons the first is aesthetics  a signature takes up a lot of space and for some compositions this could be distracting the other reason for using a symbol is well symbolic when i first began painting i was very angry and depressed at losing my eyesight the symbol stands for two eyes that are crossed out and at the time it was a symbol of defiance quickly though painting began to change how i felt and the symbol became one of affirmation a reminder that we can rise above our limitations limited edition reproductions each reproduction is limited to a run of only  prints and created on artist canvas giving the same look and feel as the original the painting is photographed producing the highest quality digital image that is possible we then evaluate the image and do any necessary color correcting we use the finest archival inks and acid free materials in the creation of the print so that they will remain unchanged for generations the print surface unless stated otherwise in on canvas not only does this allow for a much more durable and less weather sensitive print but it recreates the surface of the original artwork so that both the look and the feel of the art print is accurate  limited stretched prints  are constructed using premium artist’s canvas and ink it is coated with a uv protected layer to provide the best quality that will stand the test of time they are limited to a run of  and come with a numbered certificate of authenticity to ensure provenance the letter is signed numbered thumb printed and wax sealed each stretched canvas print comes ready to hang with preinstalled sawtooth hangers overtime if your canvas does gather dust you may wipe it off gently with a clean damp cloth limited rolled prints  use premium artists canvas and inks as well as a uv protected layer to avoid fading over time they are precisely cut to minimize fraying rolled prints will arrive in rolled in a tube with an extra ” border of unprinted material for matting or stretching they can be hung various ways either by having a professional framer matte or stretch them your rolled canvas can be wiped gently with a soft damp cloth if needed to clean dust if you are an international customer you may want to consider rolled canvas because the shipping cost is much more affordable provenance  each limited edition print comes with a certificate of authenticity ensuring that this print is one of only  that will ever be produced in this edition the certificate includes the print number artist signature artist thumbprint and wax seal  regular prints regular prints are reproduced on custom  gsm paper with
